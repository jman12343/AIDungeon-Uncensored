You really don't like working there, but at least they pay you...a little. Finally you've made it to the weekend, so you at least get to look forward to a couple days off from work.\n\nYou get in your car and drive out of the parking lot at work only to come to an almost immediate stop as you hit the traffic. It is like this every day, but Fridays are always the worst. You reach to turn the radio on, but then remember that you still haven't had time (or money) to get that fixed. You look out the window and just see the line of cars moving slowly...\n\nFinally you get home, and you're hungry. You should have stopped for something on the way home, but you just wanted to get out of that traffic and out of the car. When you arrive at the apartment parking lot, you sigh when you realize that you're late, so everyone else will be parked in the good spots. You circle the building once before you give up and park in the \"remote\" lot. Hey, at least you're home and work is over.\n\nAs you trudge towards your apartment building, you see a small brown box sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, right near where you parked. Looking around, you don't see anyone else at the moment. You can't tell if the box was left there on purpose, or if someone accidentally left it behind.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ignore it and head home...", "result": "You walk across the sidewalks and towards your apartment. You can feel the heat coming off all the cars that got to park closer to the building than you did because of that traffic. Most of the cars here are older cars, some with dents and cracked windows, just like yours. You'll earn enough one day to get a better car, you're sure of it, just not any time soon.\n\nYou start up the stairs to your apartment. When you rented this place, the $200 discount for taking the fourth floor apartment seemed like a good idea. Of course, that was before you found out the apartment above you had kids, and you still had to walk up all these stairs because the elevator was at the other end of the building. Maybe you would win the lottery, then you could build your own house where you wanted it to be: and you weren't going to have any stairs in the entire house!\n\nYou unlock your apartment and step inside. The air is pretty stale, since the management makes you pay if you leave the A/C on all day. You know without looking that the refrigerator has nothing but some old catchup. But hey, you did get paid today, so you're going to order some take-out! Just before you get to the phone to place an order, the phone starts ringing.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ignore the phone...", "result": "You make it through the regular take-out for your dinner and realize that you ended up spending way more of your paycheck than you should have. Now you're full, so maybe you won't go out tonight...well, at least not yet. Sitting around for a bit, it's Friday night, so you're sure something good will be on TV. Later on you can worry about going out.\n\nYou flip the channels and start to realize that even though you have something like 1,000 channels, there's really nothing on...nothing at all. You finally stop on some supposed reality show that's just made for laughs and embarrassing people. It's pretty bad, but you watch it all the same because it's better than watching re-runs of a game show from 20 years ago.\n\nAs you zone out, suddenly you hear a tapping on your window. Yes, you're on the fourth floor, but one of your living room windows faces the walkway/balcony that loops around the outside of one side of the apartment building. You figure it was probably just the kids from upstairs messing with you, but then you hear the tapping once again. You could just turn the TV up, but you could go see who it is.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ignore It...", "result": "Your eyes blink open and you look at the ceiling. It is a boring white, like all these apartments, but you're pretty sure it hasn't been painted in 10 or more years. You blink and sit up. At least you don't have to go to work today. Instead, today is relaxation day. First you need to head to the store to stock up on some food, then all bets are off!\n\nYou open the door to head downstairs. The day does not match your mood: it is cloudy, cool, and windy outside. In fact, the clouds are getting darker and rolling across the sky as you watch them. You better hurry and get your supplies and get back, or you're sure this storm will catch you. You trot down the stairs and head into the back lot to your car.\n\nYou start to pull out and slam on your brakes when another car starts to back out in front of you. That was close. This is a big apartment building, but you recognize that giant car as that of the old lady who lives on the first floor and does everything slow. You slowly follow her out of the parking lot and are glad when she turns the other way.\n\nYou are headed towards the grocery store, but when you take a right in the middle of town, you hear a loud \"pop\" and feel the car slide underneath you. You limp the car over to the sidewalk and get out to see that yes, you now have a flat tire. That's the second one this year, and you just remembered that you didn't replace your spare since the last time.\n\nFortunately, you have AAA, and you can call them to help you. The overly nice AAA guy on the phone tells you that it will take about an hour, but they'll be there. You sigh and lean against the hood, thinking about all the food you were going to buy, but will now have to wait.\n\nAs you're sitting there, a black four-door car slams it's brakes on next to you in a squeal of tires. The back door pops open and you can see a skinny man inside in a dark suit and dark glasses on the far side. He calls out to you, \"Get in.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Get in the car...", "result": "You get in the vehicle and take a seat. Before you have time to put on your seat belt, the vehicle starts moving quickly. As you are pressed back into your seat, you get a whiff of the car: it smells new. It looks completely new, like the plastic had just been taken off the seats this morning. You start to sit up and look out the windows, but then you realize the rear windows are not just blacked out from the outside, you cannot see out them from the inside.\n\nYou look towards the windshield as a large panel appears from the floor, sliding up to completely obscure your vision. You cannot see out the front window at all. Instead, you sit back, slightly disoriented, as the vehicle bounces through traffic and along the roads. You have no idea where you are going, or even what direction you are traveling.\n\nSuddenly you start to get sleepy and find that you are having trouble keeping your eyes open...", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue...", "result": "The first thing that you notice when you start to wake is that you are lying down on something hard. The next thing you notice is how much your head hurts. If feels like your head has been in a pinball machine. As you reach up to touch it, you hear a deep voice say, \"Oh, sorry about that headache. It will go away soon, but until then it's going to hurt quite a bit. A minor side effect of the drug, you know.\"\n\nYou open your eyes and start to sit up. It feels like a horse has kicked you in the head as you manage to start to sit and open your eyes. You find that you are sitting on the floor of the black van and the side door is open. You spin around and put your legs out the door but don't stand right away as you press your hands against your head to try and reduce the pain. Fortunately, opening your eyes doesn't seem to make the pain any worse and you take in the man outside the van.\n\nThe man is short, bald, and dressed in black pants and a tight black tee shirt. You can see cargo pockets on the pants that hang down as if they are not empty. The tight tee shirt reveals that the man has more than a few muscles. He has small, dark eyes that are set deep into his head and a strong forehead. He has a dark stubble around his chin. When he smiles, you can see he is missing at least one of his teeth. He smiles and nods as you take him in.\n\nHe crosses his bulging arms in front of his body and continues, \"So yeah, we had to knock you out because you didn't need to see where we are just yet. You know, secret and all that stuff. And before you ask, no, I don't know why you were selected. That's above my pay grade. They tell me you're coming, and I take it from there. So you ready to get started?\"\n\nYou look up with confusion on your face and think of any number of different responses from one-word responses, to anger, to being incredibly sarcastic. Before you can put the words together to respond, the man continues.\n\n\"Okay, you're confused. I get it. Sometimes people are prepared for this, sometimes they're not. And some people can't make it through the training, while other times they can. I don't feel like giving you the long story, so you're getting the short story. Here it is: \"You're in training be a spy. You get to decide the best way for you to do that. The training starts as soon as you get up off your lazy rear end. And at any time if you decide this isn't for you, you can go home. Of course, we will wipe your memory and you likely won't remember any of this, but that's your choice. Your other options? In this facility we teach stealth, charm, and weapons. So you pick one and we get started, or you choose to go home and I zap you. Got it?\"\n\nYou look around and past the man and you can see that you are in a large warehouse with a high ceiling. There are a few doors along the far wall that appear to lead into smaller offices. Off to the right is a garage door, obviously where the van came in. The space off to the left is wide open, but there are some obstacles and the floor and some chains and rope hanging from the ceiling. The man snaps his fingers as you look around and says, \"Hey, you with me here? We don't have all day.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell him to forget it, you want to go home.", "result": "You look around the space and make a decision. You tell the man, \"No way.

I don't know who you are and I don't want to know. I just want to get back to my safe life. Now, mister.\"\n\nThe man shrugs his shoulders and pulls out a small bottle. Before you can react, he presses a button on the top and a fine mist sprays into your face. You reach up to wipe away the mist, but as you do, the garage around you is already starting to get out of focus. You try to look at your hand, but it almost seems to be moving on its own. You close one eye to try and focus, but then your other eye closes as well. You only have a moment to think about that before you just stop thinking...\n\n\nYou wake up and open your eyes, but immediately regret doing so. Above you is clear, blue, bright sky. You squint and realize that you really have a pounding headache. From the view of the sky you put two and two together and realize that you're lying on your back on the ground. You gingerly move to sit up and close your eyes as your head pounds. You can't remember the last time your head hurt this much. You squint again, trying to get your bearings and realize that you're sitting on the sidewalk outside your crappy apartment. You don't really remember how you got here, but you wonder if there is any pizza leftover from last night...", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Agree to stealth training.", "result": "Whump!

You suck at hiding. Want to try again?\"\nYou aren't sure that you like this method of training. You assume that you're supposed to do something, but you don't really know what. You figure if you're going to continue this training that you need to at least move away from this crazy man who is attacking you. But then maybe that is the point -- to learn by doing. This seems a little odd because you haven't actually been given, well, any instruction at all, but you don't have a lot of choice at this moment.

He shows you many other ways you can blend into the shadows by using your body, the light, and natural lines.\nThe man looks at you and says, \"We have time for just one more training session. I can teach you more details about what you already know, or I can teach you a different skill, the choice is up to you. And yes, there is going to be a test at the end of this.

You are either ready or you are not ready. And that is what we will determine now.\" He turns and walks over to a door in the rear of the room and disappears through it.

You will enter through this doorway and you may not return. This is no longer training, this is real. There is a man inside this room that will kill you. I don't mean that you get another chance, that he's trying to scare you, or that you'll get saved at the last minute. I mean that if you fail, you will die.\"\n\nHe clears his throat and continues, \"That is not to say that we wish for you to die. Quite the contrary, we would like you to succeed. But if you are not prepared, then you will fail and in this case failure is death. Your death, in case that was not clear.\"\n\n\"Inside this room there is a table. On that table is a small box. Your job is simply to go to the table, retrieve the box, and return it to me. That is all. But, of course, it is not that simple. Also inside this room is a man whose job is to guard that box and prevent anyone from taking it.

Most of the rest of the small room is in darkness, other than what is lit by the light coming from the main warehouse. You can see through the door it is exactly as the British gentleman had described.\n\nThe entire room is about 15 feet square. There is a man standing, arms crossed in front of him, in front of the table. He has a large knife in one of his hands and you cannot be sure in the shadows, but perhaps a firearm strapped to his waist. He is staring off into the distance and is facing the wall to the left, so that you are looking at his left side. You cannot see anything on that wall where he is looking, but he does appear quite focused. The floor of the room is in darkness and you cannot really see anything else in the room.

You slowly trace your steps back the way you have come, moving back to the door and slipping out of the room.\n\nYou had a 90 percent chance of winning that battle.\n\nYou hold the box out to the man with the British accent and say, \"I believe this is what you requested?\"\n\nThe man nods and replies, \"Indeed, that was sufficient.\" He closes the door to the examination room as he continues, \"Now we shall have to see about our guard there, as he just failed his test.\" There is a yell, then a loud thump from the room, but the man ignores the sounds and walks away from the room, clearly expecting you to follow.\n\n\"You have passed the test, and that is good. You are now working for us.\" He holds his hand up before you can say anything. \"Ah, no questions yet. You do not need to know who we are. Simply accept that we are working for the U.S. government, and we aren't listed in any of the directories. It won't matter anyway, because it's not like we're going to be issuing you a paycheck and withholding taxes for you.\"\n\nHe laughs as he leads you to a set of stairs in the corner of the warehouse. He stops at the bottom of the stairs and points up the stairs. \"There, you see that door at the top of the stairs? This is where your service begins. Head up these stairs and into that room. There you will receive your mission briefing. Should you survive your first mission, we will see what else you can do, where you are needed, and what other information you may need to know. Now off with you!\"\n\nWith that, he makes a dismissive gesture with his hand. He turns and walks away from you, apparently heading back to the testing room. He does not look back as he leaves you, clearly expecting you to follow his directions. You realize that you still don't know where you are, so you really don't have any options here.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head on to the mission briefing.", "result": "You head up the stairs to the indicated room on the second floor. You've seen the door there while you were training, but you had never seen anyone go out or into that room. You're not really sure what to expect. With a last look back at your trainer on the floor of the warehouse, you turn the doorknob and walk inside.\n\nThe first thing that greets your eyes is bright light! The far side of the room is all glass and the sun is setting in that direction, really bathing the room in bright sunlight. You raise your hand to block the light and blink your eyes. At the same time you brace for an attack, realizing this is probably a setup, as you try and look around the room.\n\nYou move to your right in a defensive position and blink your eyes again. As the room comes into focus, you realize there is a couch in the middle of the room facing a small desk. On the far wall, behind the desk to the left is a white board of some kind. There is a projector on the ceiling and a nondescript man sitting behind the desk. He says, \"Oh, is that too bright?\"\n\nHe presses a button underneath the desk and the windows immediately shift to a tint and the light is quickly reduced. The man gestures towards the couch, inviting you to have a seat. He says, \"There are drinks there in the fridge if you need one.\" Taking another look, you see a small cube refrigerator on the floor next to the couch. You move towards the couch, not really sure that you know what is going on, or whether to trust this fellow. He watches you as you sit on the couch.\n\nWithout any introduction, he presses two more buttons on his desk. The projector lights up and the white board screen is filled with the face of a man with dark skin and a short, almost smashed-looking face. The man at the desk speaks, \"This is el Martillo. He is a drug lord that has really caused a great deal of trouble recently. We want to eliminate him, but we cannot get to him. He has a great fortune and he uses it effectively to keep himself alive.\"\n\nThe man pauses, then looks directly at you as he continues, \"He is a very dangerous man. Stay away from him. He is NOT your target. I repeat, stay away from him at all costs.\"\n\nHe looks back at the screen and the slide advances to show a smaller, thin man that is starting to bald, but has a dark, even tan. The man says, \"This is Jack Kauffman. He is an accountant for el Martillo. He is currently in control of an SD card that has a bitcoin account worth over ten million dollars. The SD card is your target. We need el Martillo to not have that money. We don't really care if you steal the card and bring it back to us, or if you destroy it. Your mission is to ensure that el Martillo and Jack Kauffman do not have that card.\"\n\n\"Jack Kauffman moves about and has some protection, but our intelligence has let us know where he will be shortly and when he will be moving. They change plans all the time, but we think this is the time to strike. There is a plane waiting outside to take you to Cuba now. When you arrive, there will be a car waiting for you at the airport. You will need to drive, the keys will be in it. A contact will meet you at Cafe Quinta Avenida with final details when you arrive.\"\n\n\"We do not trust the locals and el Martillo's tentacles run deep in the area. To identify yourself to the contact, you will ask, 'Is the coffee any good here?' He will reply, 'It is good, but not as good as Kenyan.' To confirm, you must reply 'Ah, but Kenyan is too expensive.' If there are any deviations from that code, the contact will not reveal his information. The abort word is 'tea.' If you or he say any phrase with the word 'tea' in it, you immediately abort the mission and return to the airport.\"\n\n\"Remember, stay away from el Martillo and steal or destroy that SD card. That is all.\" He gestures towards the door in the glass wall. For the first time you notice that there is a door there, and there is a small runway outside. As you stand up, you can see a small private plane sitting near the bottom of the stairs outside the door with the airplane door open.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the waiting airplane.", "result": "You head towards the door. The man has started to pull some papers out of the desk and is reading them. He ignores you as you open the door only to be assaulted by the sunshine once again. There is a wave of heat coming off the runway that catches you by surprise, but it is quickly washed away with a gentle breeze.\n\nYou walk down the stairs and towards the plane. As you approach, a man dressed in a uniform steps from around the side of the plane and gestures towards the entrance, welcoming you to the plane. You move up the steps and into the plane. Inside the plane is clearly a luxury craft designed for the rich. There are four swiveling captain's chairs, wood grain cabinets, and a number of flat screens. You take a seat and sink into the soft leather of the chair.\n\nThe man in uniform steps onto the plane behind you. He says, \"Sorry, but due to secrecy, there will be no flight attendant on this flight. You can sit anywhere, and I suggest you keep your seat belt on at all times.\" It then that you notice there are seat belts in the leather chairs. The man continues, \"The flight should be over in a couple hours. I would announce when we're landing, but it will be pretty obvious. Enjoy your flight.\"\n\nWithout pausing for questions, the man pulls up the stairs, closes the door, then steps into the cabin. The door to the cabin closes with a click and you are alone in the plane. A few moments later you hear the jet engines start up. You wait for the announcements that never come and the plane starts moving. A minute later you are pressed back into your seat as the plane speeds up down the runway.\n\nYou sit back and relax in the seat, planning to get up and explore the plane soon. Before you know it, you are out cold, enjoying the comfort of the seat. You awake with a start when the wheels of the plane touch down onto the ground once again. You look around quickly, trying to re-orient yourself as the plane taxis to a terminal. Looking out the window you see a small shack at the side of what looks like a very new runway. The plane moves towards the shack and in no time the captain comes out of the cabin. Without a word he opens the door and puts down the steps. He stays on board the plane and gestures you towards the exit.\n\nStepping outside, you feel the humid heat wash over you. The sun is shining brightly, and you can only assume that you are in Cuba. Blinking in the sun, you can see an old sedan parked next to the hut. You start walking towards the car and you hear the door slam shut behind you. The plane is already in motion before you make it to the car. You shrug and figure that it's too late to back out now.\n\nThe gravel crunches under your feet as you walk towards the car. There are bits of dust in the air and you can see a long dirt road headed in two directions from the small hut. Walking past the hut, you don't see anyone in the building at all. In fact, it looks like it has been abandoned for some time now. When you arrive at the dark blue car, you look inside and can see a set of keys sitting on the seat. Next to the keys are a map with four locations circled in red. You can tell that one is a runway, apparently where you are now. The second is in town, so that must be the coffee shop. The third looks like an estate on a hill, which must be el Martillo's house. The last is a large building and the only one labeled on the map, and it is labeled, \"Hotel Melia Habana.\"\n\nYou open the door and get in the car.
