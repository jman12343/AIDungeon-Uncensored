You slacked off all semester and didn\u2019t study for your finals. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to pass your nature magic test tomorrow. Those things are always killers. You don\u2019t even know why you enrolled in that class; you aren\u2019t even interested in being a nature mage. You don\u2019t even like the damn outdoors!\n\nOh wait, you know why, it\u2019s because you saw a cute witch taking the class, so like a dumb ass, you signed up for it. Naturally the moment you tried to impress her with some sort of cantrip, she laughed at you and said even if she was straight, she wouldn\u2019t go for a half assed hedge wizard like you! You really should\u2019ve known better, half of those witches are lesbians anyway. That whole Mother Earth Goddess worship caters to the rug munching. (And no, there aren\u2019t any MALE witches, any self respecting man would call himself a WARLOCK, not a damn witch!)\n\n(Sigh) Like your little sister\u2019s B\u2019ar\u2019b Dolly once said \u201cMagic is hard!\u201d Indeed. Sometimes you curse the day your mother passed her magical elven blood on to you.\n\nStill, you\u2019re here now, so you need to make the best out of your life. You\u2019re already going to hear it from both of your parents of how you\u2019ve been nothing but a disappointment to the both of them. Your Dad will probably do a little more than say that, he\u2019ll probably personally ride up to the University and beat the hell out of you for wasting his hard earned pillaging money to send you there in the first place.\n\nArrgh! You just wish you were good at SOME kind of magic! You have the ability; you just don\u2019t have the focus! That\u2019s always been the problem with you. Your sister has it easy, she took after Dad. Narrow minded focus on killing someone with a blunt instrument doesn\u2019t take too much effort. Of course you had to be the one that greater things were expected of.\n\nYou\u2019ve tried all the schools, evocation, conjuration, illusion, divination; all of them. You can\u2019t excel in any of it. You can only get so far and then the words and gestures and well all of it just becomes too fucking confusing for you.\n\nHowever, you haven\u2019t tried the \u201cdarker arts\u201d, but your Mom would definitely never approve. (Your Dad probably wouldn\u2019t care, but if you upset your Mom, it\u2019s a warhammer upside the head) In fact it\u2019s illegal to study any of them. They caused too much trouble in the past and nearly destroyed the world at one time. All who are known to even dabble in such arts are immediately taken into custody and executed.\n\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to be summoning demons anyway; even the few \u201cfriendly ones\u201d that work on campus are fucking assholes to the Nth degree. You can only imagine how bad the ones who haven\u2019t been living among mortals are.\n\nHowever there is another dark art which you have to admit you\u2019ve always had a bit of curiosity about.\n\nThe art in question is necromancy.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re willing to at least see if you\u2019re good at ANYTHING, so for shits and giggles you decide to blow off your test which you\u2019re going to fail anyway and go see if you can find out more about this outlawed dark art.\n\nThough being a lazy sort you decide to try the library first.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go make a trip to the library", "result": "Even though you\u2019re supposed to be a wizard in training, you spend as little time as possible in library if you can help it. Normally you just check out whatever you need to read for a class and leave.\n\nYou have little faith in finding anything substantial on Necromancy in there, but maybe you can find something that will at least quell this thirst for knowledge on it. You realize you\u2019re treading on dangerous ground, but you have to try to learn more.\n\nThe library is huge however, and you\u2019re unsure of where to look, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a section on Necromancy or Outlawed Magic, but you figure you\u2019ll look in the History section first.\n\nYou glance and browse through the stacks until you pick up a few choice books that look like they might contain something, sit down in a quiet corner and begin to read. Naturally you don\u2019t learn too much. The history books mainly go on about how bad the Dead War was, important battles, the atrocities of the Lich Lord, the typical stuff you\u2019ve read time and time again. Still, you\u2019re determined to find something new.\n\nYou spend hours reading until you realize you\u2019ve spent the day in the library and that it\u2019s now night time. Oddly the library is mostly empty, and that\u2019s probably because finals are now over, one of which you\u2019ve now undoubtedly failed. You think of how stupid you\u2019ve been to obsess over an outlawed art that you probably wouldn\u2019t be any good at anyway! You\u2019ve only been dwelling on the subject to ignore your own problems that you could\u2019ve tried to solve yourself, instead of fantasizing about being some Necromancer. Raising the dead\u2026what good would that do you? Delusions of grandeur. You wouldn\u2019t have enough motivation to try to take over the world anyway. There was only one person who truly motivated you, and she\u2019s gone.\n\nYou begin to think about Serena and begin to feel sorrow like when you first lost her. You\u2019ve had enough of death. You leave the library in a daze and head back home to sleep off this miserable day.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape though; even your dreams bring death. You dream about Serena. At first she\u2019s alive and vibrant, and then suddenly she dies before your eyes. Then you see her grave with you sobbing over it and shouting how you demand that she not leave you.\n\nThen she rises from her grave\u2026and you wake up only to come face to face with her! She is a ghost floating near your bed.\n\n\u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d you shout and back up against your headboard.\n\u201cShhhh! Hush my love, I\u2019m risking a lot just by being here.\u201d She says looking around as if someone is going to bust down your door any minute.\n\u201cSerena, what\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t a dream is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear I assure you that I am very real. And I have a message for you.\u201d\n\u201cA message?\u201d\n\u201cYes, embrace death and all the beauty it has to offer.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to kill myself, to join you?\u201d\nSerena laughs a bit. \u201cNo silly, you are to become a necromancer and bring the purity of death to the world.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yeah right. With my aptitude of magic, I doubt if I could raise a mouse skeleton.\u201d\n\u201cYou always did lack confidence in yourself. I suppose that\u2019s why they sent me to motivate you one last time. Though I admit, I would\u2019ve come to see you anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThey?\u201d\n\nSerena side steps your question and continues.\n\n\u201cLook we haven\u2019t much time, but you HAVE the ability to become the greatest Necromancer since the Great Lich Lord who brought the world near the brink of extinction centuries ago, but you cannot do it alone\u2026at least not yet. You must have allies. There are others like you on this campus who long to practice the dark arts. Seek them out and take over this college as your first step to your destiny.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Hold on! What makes you think I want to do all this?\u201d\n\nSerena floats closer to you and touches your face with a ghostly hand. You feel completely calm.\n\n\u201cBecause deep down it IS what you want. You know your thoughts are dominated by death. You even think of me rather than living girls and I\u2019ve been dead for years. The very fact that your mind played a part in summoning me here is also proof of your desire.\u201d\n\u201cI miss you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know you do, but my point is, even before I died I remember you having an interest in the dark arts. Indeed it\u2019s part of what attracted me to you. But now I must return and you must fulfill your part in this world, whether you succeed or fail at this endeavor will ultimately be up to you, but I believe you will succeed.\u201d\n\nSerena then floats a little closer to kiss you.\n\n\u201cFarewell, my love.\u201d She says and then disappears.\n\nYou\u2019re now wide awake and pacing the floor. You\u2019ve been ambivalent about pursuing this path before, but the more you think about it and with this visit from Serena, this is the path you\u2019re going to choose. And why not? It\u2019s not like you have any better options in your life at this point.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do it, and though Serena mentioned others like you being on campus, you\u2019re damned if you have a clue to as of knowing who they are since you don\u2019t really socialize. Still, you can think of two people that could get you started. (Or at least not rat on you, when you start inquiring about Necromancy)\n\nThe next day you take your first steps towards darkness\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Go talk to your creepy conjuration professor, Mr. Demar", "result": "Chapter 2: Death Awaits\n\nSerena\u2019s right, you\u2019re going to need the help of others and you head to Mr. Demar\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Demar\u2019s class was probably the only one you didn\u2019t struggle in too much. It\u2019s not really a popular field given that conjuration can lead to summoning demons. Still, there is use for it on a minor level, though of course it\u2019s strictly regulated by most governments.\n\nMr. Demar was a good professor, but the general agreement by everyone in your class, was that he was REALLY creepy. Plus there were always rumors about him. You always got the impression he was interested in doing a lot more with his area of expertise, but had to settle for teaching. He always seemed to be alright with you though.\n\nWhen you get to his office, surprisingly it\u2019s open and he\u2019s busily shuffling some papers around.\n\n\u201cMr. Demar?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What? Damn it, I thought I locked that door! Oh it\u2019s you, what do you want? And lock that door.\u201d\n\u201cWell uh\u2026I had some questions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, what are they? Out with it.\u201d He says continuing to look at some strange parchments.\n\u201cWell, uh\u2026I guess it\u2019s about magic, and I guess um\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Demar looks up at you like he\u2019s going to slap you for stuttering so much. You finally speak up.\n\n\u201cI want to know more about Necromancy.\u201d\n\nMr. Demar steps back and gives you a few inspecting stares.\n\n\u201cI dunno what you\u2019re talking about, in fact if you don\u2019t get out of here I\u2019m going report you to the dean for asking such questions.\u201d He warns, but you get the impression that he\u2019s not telling the truth. He probably thinks you were sent to spy on him by the dean or something. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t been held under close scrutiny before.\n\n\u201cMr. Demar, I\u2019m not trying to get you into trouble, it\u2019s me! I really want to learn Necromancy, and you\u2019re about the only one I think can help me! I actually was worried about coming to you and I was nervous about the whole thing!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well I guess I always did think you were inclined towards the dark arts and given your annoying stuttering a moment ago, you do sound like you were nervous. Okay, you want to learn? I\u2019ll teach you. I\u2019ll teach you like I\u2019m currently teaching so many others right now. Surprised? Yes, the time is coming to pass that we who are inclined to REAL power begin to make our place in this world\u2026permanently. Though I still have concerns about you, I mean while you did about average in my class, I\u2019m well aware that you\u2019re not exactly the best student in other fields. I question whether you can handle the power of the dark arts, let alone become a Necromancer.\u201d\n\nYou stand up straight and reply. \u201cI\u2019m confident that this is my path.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you said that, because there\u2019s no going back and this path is not for the weak. We also must maintain secrecy at all times until the day that we may take what is rightfully ours. Now come with me, we\u2019re going to see exactly what kind of potential you have.\u201d\n\nMr. Demar casts a spell and opens up a portal. He then prepares to enter it and beckons you to follow him, which you do. Suddenly you\u2019re whisked away into a place of near darkness. Given your immediate surroundings you\u2019d guess that you\u2019re underground somewhere. You can hear the clinking of chains though nearby and moans.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u201cYour testing area, this where we\u2019re going to find out what exactly you\u2019re made of. In the next room, you\u2019ll find some undead friends. They\u2019re currently chained up, but they won\u2019t be for long. Now, you can kill them, but as a Necromancer you\u2019re supposed to be controlling them, so obviously you should try to do that.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how! You haven\u2019t taught me any spells!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to, you\u2019re going to have to figure this out yourself, but I will say this, it\u2019s all about the strength of willpower. Tap into your magical energy and if you have what it takes, you\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nDemar disappears back into the portal and leaves you all by yourself. You\u2019ve really gotten yourself into it and now there really isn\u2019t any going back, and you can hear the chains from the next room dropping to the ground and the moans getting louder and closer.\n\nThere\u2019s a large bone on the ground and not much else in the room, and you can\u2019t run either as there are no other exits.", "action_results": [{"action": "Pick up the bone and defend yourself", "result": "You pick up the large bone and prepare for whatever is coming at you. A couple of zombies enter and as soon as they see you they shamble over.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re a little shaken, and you attempt to do exactly what Demar said, but you\u2019re not having any effect. Soon one of the zombies is almost upon you and you lash out with the bone.\n\nYou give a few good whacks to the first one\u2019s skull causing it to collapse lifeless once again. You do the same to the second one. You\u2019re breathing hard and thank the fact that they were slow enough not to easily catch you.\n\nHowever, your victory is short lived, when Demar appears again.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) you killed them, after I told you that was not the purpose. Plus you gave a poor showing in even attempting to control them. I don\u2019t see a future for you, if you cave under pressure like that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little dejected, but the worse is yet to come, when you find you won\u2019t be leaving this place. Mr. Demar can\u2019t risk you knowing about this place yet not being a disciple of his. He didn\u2019t last this long being undetected by taking chances.\n\nWith a few quick mumblings and you feel your body ravaged by rot. It\u2019s a horrible death, but one that results in you rising to take the place of the \u201ctest\u201d zombies you just ruined.\n\nYou spend your remaining undead life shambling around underground until eventually when Demar feels it\u2019s time to attack, you\u2019re one of the first cannon fodder troops to be destroyed in the attempted take over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Try to prepare and concentrate", "result": "You begin to concentrate and prepare for whatever is coming at you. A couple of zombies enter and as soon as they see you they shamble over.\n\nYou maintain your calmness and focus, backing up only to get out their reach. It\u2019s not work though, but you refuse to give up so you do something that you never thought you\u2019d ever use.\n\nYou\u2019re underground and there are a lot of roots where you\u2019re at, you remember a minor spell you learned in you nature magic class. You cast the spell, and the roots entwine the zombies\u2019 feet causing them to be unable to move at you anymore. You then concentrate on controlling them, which now comes a lot easier to you because you don\u2019t feel in danger anymore.\n\nWhen you\u2019re sure you have a hold on them, you release the roots and then practice telling the zombies what to do. Sort of fun, like having a pet. Your fun is cut short when Mr. Demar reappears.\n\n\u201cWell, that was an interesting way of handling things. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen combining nature magic with necromancy before. Usually the student kills one of the zombies with a fireball or something and then focuses all their attention to control the other one. Still, whatever works, and you are one of the few that\u2019s managed to control the both of them with no training in necromancy at all, so you have natural talent. And natural talent will serve you better for this path.\u201d\n\u201cI understand why you gave me the test, but I have to say I thought you\u2019d start me off on raising the dead rather than controlling them first.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAh! Yes, that\u2019s a common misconception. You want to know why most necromancers fail even before they get started? Because they lack the control. Raising the dead is relatively easy; controlling them takes a great deal more focus and power. Most of the time a neophyte necromancer will go to the local graveyard and end up getting himself killed by the very bodies he raised because he can\u2019t control them. Okay, I think it\u2019s time we introduce you to the rest of the class. We\u2019ll have lots of time to practice while most of the so called regular students are away for vacation.\u201d\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m ready, but I was supposed to go visit my family for vacation\u2026and well also I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve passed all my classes either, specifically the nature magic class.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? (Sigh) Very well I shall take care of your grade; I know exactly how to handle the situation and I have a lot more pull in this school than most could ever dream of. As for your family members, I\u2019ll leave that up to you. Surely you can think up something to tell them, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cVery well then, it\u2019s all settled. Time to meet the rest of your kind.\u201d\n\nOnce again Mr. Demar takes you through another portal. You\u2019re still underground, but now you\u2019re in a more structured setting with actual bricks rather than a cave like setting.\n\nYou\u2019re soon introduced to the rest of Mr. Demar\u2019s \u201cclass\u201d known as the Dark Order. Some of whom you\u2019ve actually seen on campus or even in your other classes. Those that know you are surprised.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting THAT guy in here? I remember him back in Illusion class, and he ended up creating clones that punched the professor in the face!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing, back in Evocation class; he ended up setting the professor on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough class! I can assure you that he has the potential to master the dark arts. He wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think so. Now Trelik and Felsa, you\u2019re coming with me, the rest of you practice your lessons and one of you help our newest associate here get started, we\u2019re all in this together you know.\u201d\n\n\nAfter Demar leaves with two of his students, you\u2019re left to your own devices as it seems nobody wants to help you. You look around the study area a bit and you start to pick up one of the many tomes lying around until someone comes up to you.\n\n\u201cHey, do you even know what those are for?\u201d an ugly student asks you.\n\u201cWell, they have a skull on the front, and from the looks of them they contain descriptions of various types of undead creature. My guess necromancy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so what do you know of it?\u201d\n\u201cNot much, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here obviously, isn\u2019t that why everyone else is?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, in fact you\u2019re only the fifth necromancer-to-be here. Most of the students are into studying how to control the infernal planes. You know Demonology. There\u2019s even a guy studying on the lost art of temporal magic.\u201d\n\u201cTemporal? You mean time?\u201d\n\u201cYep, a lot of people forget about that one being outlawed as well. Good reason, considering it could really fuck up something if not used properly. I\u2019d actually stay away from Quayle, I think all that studying on time has made him a little loopy. He tends to talk backwards, and sideways a lot. Even Mr. Demar has a hard time keeping him on track.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting, so what\u2019s your name, are you a demonologist?\u201d\n\u201cMe, nope I\u2019m one of the disciples of death as they say. My name\u2019s Sebastian. You might as well meet the others, you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d\n\nSebastian takes you over to two other students. Catalina and Irwin. They nod at you and go back to their training which involves creating a some sort of bone golem. Catalina looks somewhat familiar. Sebastian tells you the other is Trelik who just left with Mr. Demar.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most skilled, besides Mr. Demar of course.\u201d Sebastian says.\n\u201cSo what exactly do I start on first?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019d start out with raising and controlling some skeletons. I know you probably did the zombie thing, but you\u2019ll need to hone your skill a lot and skeletons are easier to practice with. Take this book, and get started. You\u2019ll find the bone pits down the corridor and to the right, don\u2019t go left though; the demonologists got some bad ass demon locked in a circle down there. He\u2019s really pissed off too. Best stay away.\u201d\n\nYou take one of the necromantic tomes and head down the corridor. On your way there, you begin to hear a voice penetrating your head.\n\n\u201cYou, come here. I know you. You seek power. I can give you that power; you need not waste your time studying anymore. I can grant it to you instantly. You want to be a master of death? Come to me\u2026\u201d\n\nThis voice is very tempting.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head down the left corridor", "result": "You feel compelled to follow the voice and you head down the left corridor where eventually you come across a demon sitting in a couched position in a circle. He\u2019s looking at the chalk that creates the circle around him, before looking up at you. He\u2019s a lot bigger and meaner looking than even the demons you\u2019ve met on campus. He certainly doesn\u2019t seem happy to be trapped. You suspect that they summoned this guy up from hell recently.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cMy real name is unimportant, but you can call me Velzix\u2026and you are the new disciple of Demar\u2019s delusional bunch of would be shit starters. They believe that they will be able to take over this school by using the dark arts. And perhaps they may, but such a victory will be fleeting. Mortals lack long term vision. They will not be prepared when the entire world unites against them\u2026but you can be spared that fate. Free me, and I promise you that you will become a powerful force in the struggle ahead.\u201d\n\u201cWhile that sound tempting, demons are known for their deceitful nature and infamous for getting around loopholes in so called deals they make.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, it is something we pride ourselves on\u2026very well I will not harm you when you free me. That is what you worried about isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt had crossed my mind.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, now you may free me.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Free Velzix", "result": "You easily remove the chalk around Velzix.\n\n\u201cAh yes, another lack of vision, if they had been smarter they would\u2019ve also placed a magical barrier around the chalk circle and bound me in magic chains. Well, now they shall pay for their arrogance!\u201d\n\nVelzix now free from his prison lets out an unearthly roar and pushes you aside to take revenge on his captors. As you recover and get off the floor, you can already hear the sounds of battle, followed by screams.\n\nYou hesitantly head towards the study area, and there you see carnage. The demon has easily killed everyone and is now casting some sort of spell.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m free, this world is going to suffer. That puny mortal Demar\u2019s petty plans pale in comparison in what I have in mind. He\u2019ll be first on the list that I\u2019ll track down.

Like I said you mortals lack such vision!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t even have time to run before the demons jump on top of you and begin to rip you to pieces, the only good thing is you were spared the horrors that Velzix unleashed upon the world.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Negotiate some more", "result": "Velzix isn\u2019t pleased that you\u2019re attempting to negotiate with him.

What\u2019re you doing here! You\u2019re not even a demonologist!\u201d one of them yells.\n\u201cWeak minded fool was probably tempted by Velzix\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I never said anything to him, he wandered down here on his own accord, and started talking to me about striking a deal of some kind.\u201d Velzix says with a smile.\n\u201cI DID NOT!\u201d you protest.\n\nYour protests don\u2019t do too much to help you though. The rest of the students decide you\u2019re either lying, or you don\u2019t have the mental strength to resist the temptations of Velzix. And in either case you\u2019re a liability that they can\u2019t afford.\n\nYou\u2019re struck by several lightning bolts and your corpse is completely burned black before you even fall to the ground.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Head to the bone pits", "result": "No way, you\u2019re not going down that path. There are too many stories about demons fucking people over in their deals. In fact, you\u2019re a little worried about the fact that this \u201cclass\u201d has more dedicated demonologist than necromancers. Still you\u2019ll just have to deal with it for now, you can only hope they know what they\u2019re doing and have a better grasp on things than a certain cabal of wizards did during the Dead War.\n\nAs for you, you need to start mastering your own branch of magic. When you get to the pits, you are literally surrounded by bones. You open up your book and begin to read a bit before casting your spell.\n\nYour first attempt isn\u2019t too bad. You animate one skeleton, and surprisingly it doesn\u2019t attack you. You continue to practice this, and while it\u2019s only been an hour, you\u2019ve already animated thirty skeletons, all of which are completely obedient and not attempting to attack you at all.\n\nYou\u2019re not sure if this is normal, good or bad for a beginner, but given how many problems you had with other branches of magic, you think you\u2019re doing pretty well. In fact you feel pretty proud of yourself.\n\nYou decide to get a little more inventive and you see rusty weapons on the floor along with the bones. You command the skeletons to pick them up and begin to start sparring with each other. They do so, without problems.\n\n\n\nThis sound of minor battle brings in a few of the students, most of whom are shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going\u2026whoa. I thought you said you never did this before.\u201d Sebastian says walking in.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t\u2026I dunno, it\u2019s just coming so easy to me. For the first time I feel like I\u2019m actually good at something!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a lot better than what you did in Enchantment class when you managed to charm all those frogs which then proceeded to attack the professor.\u201d Catalina says.\n\u201cThat was you? I even heard about that. Man, what is it with you and your spells accidentally hurting your professors in some way?\u201d Irwin adds.\n\nYou ignore Irwin\u2019s question, and address Catalina.\n\u201cI thought I remembered you from somewhere. I asked you out once.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes and you were unsuccessful in that as well. I suggest you stop looking at me and pay attention to your little army there, before they get out of hand. Like that one.\u201d\n\nYou turn around and stop one of the skeletons that\u2019s wandering in your direction and then command him to go back to sparring.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019ve never seen someone with this much control just starting out. Well Trelik comes to mind, but he was already very skilled in general magic and was learning directly under Mr. Demar. From what others have said, you were completely inept at magic and have no previous training in this stuff whatsoever. You\u2019re like an idiot savant of necromancy or something.\u201d Sebastian says.\n\u201cUm\u2026thanks. I think.\u201d\n\u201cWell anyway, glad you\u2019ve joined up. We\u2019ll leave you be. If you want to try something harder, there\u2019s more tomes in the study area and just ask one of us where the other practice centers are.\u201d\n\nAnd so it goes. You find your place among the Dark Order and practice your skills there, in fact it gets to the point that you rarely leave the secret underground base at all. You begin to catch the attention of Mr. Demar who is very impressed with your ability to learn and master so quickly. \u201cNatural\u201d isn\u2019t the word for it, more like prodigy. Trelik however is showing signs of jealousy\u2026\n\nMr. Demar has to tell you to take a break every now and then or else you\u2019ll drain yourself. You don\u2019t feel that way though, you feel like you have more energy than ever.\n\nAs he promised your grades were \u201cfixed\u201d though Mr. Demar\u2019s actions meaning you don\u2019t get kicked out of the college. You tell your parents that you\u2019re taking an advanced course in magic that requires you to stay and how you\u2019re really excited about it. Your Mom is a little disappointed that she won\u2019t see you, but is happy to hear that you\u2019re doing so much better in school.\n\nIf she only knew\u2026\n\nThe City of Nuro is a quieter place with less students around, but the guise of secrecy still must be kept. After a month has passed you find out that this \u201cclass\u201d aren\u2019t the only allies Mr. Demar has. He\u2019s been teaching the dark arts for years and most of his \u201cgraduates\u201d are living in this city. The attack is going to come when classes first start up again. Demar feels that it will actually be more beneficial to attack with more people in the city because after the demons are done with the killing, the Necromancers can raise the dead to reinforce the hold on the city.\n\nOne key part in all of this is Quayle. He is to cast a slow spell of the greatest proportions over the city. While everyone else is moving at a near stand still, the Dark Order will be able to take over key locations much easier.\n\nWhile all of this sounds exciting you can\u2019t help but still be concerned about this plan. Mr. Demar is placing most of his faith in the demonologist, which you suppose is understandable given his background in conjuration, but you feel as if you necromancers are getting put on the backburner. Sure you\u2019re playing your part, but it almost seems as if you\u2019re just there as \u201cback up\u201d. Not to mention you\u2019re still not keen on the whole idea of dealing with so many demons.\n\nOf course these concerns are the least of your problems as another month goes by, Trelik is becoming a complete asshole to you. Within the short time you\u2019ve been here, he\u2019s time and time again attempted to sabotage your spells, but usually you manage to overcome.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a month to go before the final plans are in place, but suddenly Mr. Demar has some news he\u2019s not pleased to inform everyone of.\n\n\u201cClass, we\u2019ve got a delegate from the Vampire Clans. I don\u2019t think I have to tell you how annoying this is.\u201d\n\nYou ask Sebastian what\u2019s the problem and what exactly is going. Sebastian tells you that ever since the clans heard about Demar\u2019s plans, they\u2019ve been strongly opposed to them for they fear that it will draw attention to their one last stronghold which is kept invisible and secret to the rest of the world. It is there where the last of the \u201cruling\u201d class vampires still exist, most of them having been killed or degenerated into little more than mindless beasts that are eventually hunted down.\n\nWhile you\u2019re fascinated by Sebastian\u2019s explanation of things, you\u2019re suddenly singled out by Trelik.\n\n\u201cYOU! Do you find this so unimportant that you feel the need not to pay attention?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I just didn\u2019t know the whole situation and I was asking\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf you wanted more information you should\u2019ve been asking Mr. Demar after he was done talking!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. That will do Trelik. Someone should\u2019ve explained it to him before actually, given that he\u2019ll be playing a large part in this plan. In fact, maybe he should come with me to meet the delegate instead.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mr. Demar! I have more experience in this sort of thing!\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but to be quite honest, the blood suckers don\u2019t care too much for you. You\u2019re too combative. So how about it? Do you wish to be present when I speak to this delegate?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Mr. Demar", "result": "\u201cSure I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, you and Felsa are coming with me. Trelik, you go brush up on the attack strategy.\u201d\n\u201cBut!\u201d\n\u201cNo buts! Just do it!\u201d\n\nTrelik storms off while you, Mr. Demar and Felsa head towards the conference room. When you arrive, you see a single pale emaciated figure. He doesn\u2019t look at all like the vampires you\u2019ve heard of in past. There is no regality here.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you showed up. I must confess I was not enthused about you leaving me here waiting like a dog. We have very important matters to discuss!\u201d he hisses.\n\u201cMy apologies Yolev. I just needed to take care of a few things. Please sit, and let us all discuss this.\u201d\n\u201cThere really is no discussion Mr. Demar! You are to cease your plan immediately lest you face the full brunt of the vampire clans! Your foolish mortal desires will kill us all and we cannot allow that to happen! We must continue to survive!\u201d\n\u201cSurvive? Is that all you vampires worry about anymore? Why at one time you were secret rulers and puppet masters. Hell, without you the Great Lich Lord wouldn\u2019t have made nearly as much progress as he did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd THAT folly of those ignorant vampires is exactly why we must stop you now. The Dead War cost us greatly, we should not have thrown our lot in with a mad man who was determined to bring death to the world. It was only at the last minute that the wiser of us realized to do so would be detrimental to us. Almost too late. We are only a shadow of our former selves, but that shadow is still long\u2026and we can make life difficult for you.\u201d Yolev warns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t respond well to idle threats, but I will say this, your fears are unfounded. The Dark Order is not seeking to bring death to the world, we are merely going to reestablish the proper order of things. The strong were meant to rule, and WE are the strong. Those who master the dark arts have always been strong. It is why we are so feared and hated and hunted. You should not be against us Yolev. You should see this as an opportunity to reestablish your rightful place as vampires.\u201d\n\nMr. Demar\u2019s words have a slight effect on Yolev. He falls silent and looks almost wistful of ancient times, when his kind roamed more free in civilization, rather than hiding and cowering on the outskirts like animals. He quickly snaps out of it though.\n\n\u201cIdealistic words, Mr. Demar, but even if we were still to use what little influence we still have, I cannot believe that you and a few students can change the world. Even if you manage to take this one city, you can\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll get away with it. You there! You\u2019re one of these students are you not? What do you think? And tell me what you TRULY think, not what Mr. Demar wants you to think.\u201d Yolev points to you.\n\n\u201cWell uh\u2026I think we can do it.\u201d You stutter off guard.\n\u201c\u2026You think you can do it? Is that all you have to say about it? This is what you\u2019re working with Mr. Demar? How could we ever place any faith in your plan when you\u2019re training near idiots that can barely form sentences?\u201d\n\u201cYolev, you might be a delegate, but you best watch your tone, you\u2019re not in the best position right now, and given your previous threats you\u2019re already treading on dangerous ground.\u201d\n\u201cYou dare to threaten ME? I\u2019ve crushed greater men AND women than you!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and now you\u2019re a running lap dog for some so called vampire king who rules over nothing but a few remaining scraps of a dying legacy.\u201d\n\nAs this begins to get hostile, you notice Felsa preparing to cast something.\n\nYou think that if you say anything, things are only going to get worse, so you stand back and do nothing, but hostilities don\u2019t cease and eventually Felsa casts a blast of fire at Yolev, he falls to the floor trying to beat out the flames, but Demar isn\u2019t pleased.\n\n\u201cFELSA! WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?\u201d he shouts and then finishes off Yolev by casting some sort of spell that causes his chest to explode. Two Imps suddenly appear and begin to rip Yolev apart before he can get a chance to recover.\n\n\u201cThe pair of you really fucked up today! You with your actions and you with your bumbling! I might as well had Trelik with me! Shit! (Sigh) Alright. Fine we can still do this, but the vampires are going to be pissed off at us now for killing their delegate and it\u2019s definitely going to make things harder. Come on we got a lot to prepare for.\u201d\n\nThe last month is no picnic. Mr. Demar has you all training a lot harder than you have before. He\u2019s been pushing everyone a lot harder to the point that they\u2019re getting tired and sloppy. One of the demonologists gets eaten by a brimstone beast. Another accidentally casts a spell backwards and causes himself to be sucked into the infernal realm. Morale isn\u2019t exactly the highest.\n\nBut the plan goes through and after the first week classes go back in session, the gates of hell are literally opened. Portals appear all over various parts of not only the campus, but also the city. Demons come swarming out of the portals gleefully killing all in their path. The demonologist lead the attack, while you and the other three necromancers take advantage of all the new corpses in the area. Soon, you have a fair sized army of dead. Mr. Demar himself is taking on the head professors at the college, with the help of Felsa and Trelik. Given the amount of explosions you\u2019re seeing from the streets, you\u2019re glad you got a \u201clower\u201d assignment.\n\nAll seems to be going well until it looks like the demons have decided to leave the city limits, one of the demonologists tries to corral them back shouting that they are supposed to only concentrate on Nuro, but they laugh and simply say: \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that in the deal!\u201d\n\nWith the demons completely unreliable now, it\u2019s up to you necromancers to take up the slack. You do alright, but there\u2019s still a lot of resistance and something has gone wrong with Quayle\u2019s spell as your attackers are beginning to move at a normal rate instead of a slower one.\n\nYou don\u2019t see this ending well, unless something changes quick. Even if you win, you know you got a shit load of problems ahead of you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attempt to regroup", "result": "Victory isn\u2019t beyond your grasp, you just need to regroup and organize. You immediately seek out Irwin, Sebastian and Catalina.\n\nYou find Sebastian and Catalina, and they\u2019re running low on viable corpses.\n\n\u201cHey, glad you could get here, the Nuro mage guards are putting up a hell of a fight! The demonologists can\u2019t keep the demons in line and whatever former graduates Mr. Demar had to help us are probably all dead by now!\u201d Sebastian explains.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s bad all over. Where\u2019s Irwin?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIrwin? He\u2019s dead; can\u2019t you see his body lying over there with all the arrows in it?\u201d Catalina points out.\n\u201cWell, no point in letting this go to waste, we need all the help we can get.\u201d You say and command Irwin to rise to join the rest of the horde\n\nYou tell Catalina and Sebastian to hand control over the rest of their troops to you, as if you can concentrate them with a single mind, you\u2019ll be able to break the doors down of city hall and take out the remainder of the mage guards holding out there. You also tell them that one should head back to the college itself and go check on Quayle, and the other should go help out Mr. Demar.\n\nOddly enough Sebastian and Catalina obey your orders immediately. You begin to feel even more confident in your power of command. You proceed to tell your now larger undead horde to attack the last bastion of Nuro\u2019s governmental control. You unleash blasts of dark energy at the mage guards who attempt to defend from the windows while your zombies and skeletons break down the doors and begin to massacre all those inside.\n\n\n\nYou enter the building nearly oblivious to the carnage. You feel a very real sense of calming peace amongst the death. Eventually you encounter the \u201cFirst Citizen\u201d of Nuro busily trying to slay as many of your soldiers as possible, but as you continue to raise them, even he realizes it\u2019s a futile endeavor.\n\nA skeleton warrior hacks his arm off with an axe, and then a recently raised mage guard clubs him in the head with a small mace. He falls to the floor of his own office before your feet and looks up at you.\n\n\u201cWhy? You\u2026you\u2019ll never get away with this\u2026\u201d he sputters as he bleeds out.\n\u201cYou might be right, but it\u2019ll be interesting to see if I do.\u201d You calmly say and kick him in the face before another skeleton lands a killing blow to him. He is then raised to join the ranks.\n\nYou exit the building and notice that the city is near empty. At least as far as the living go. The dead however are plentiful, bodies litter the streets. More resources for you, you think.\n\nA demonologist looking very worn from battle sees you and you have to stop your small horde from attacking.\n\n\u201cHey hold on! I\u2019m on your side! Shit, this didn\u2019t turn out as planned, did it?\u201d\n\u201cOh I dunno, we got the city.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but Mr. Demar is still battling the rest of the staff in the college and I\u2019m really worried about what the hell\u2019s going on with Quayle\u2019s spell, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve experienced it yet, but I\u2019ve been seeing buildings phase in and out of existence. I knew fucking around with time would be trouble!\u201d\n\u201cWhere are all of the demons?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMost of them left! I mean there\u2019s a few that stuck around, most of the weaker variety. There was a major demon called Velzix who was supposed to be helping, but he took off as well. Bah! Unreliable lot they are. I should\u2019ve done what you did, become a necromancer! The dead always obey.\u201d\n\u201cNot always\u2026but you may still fulfill your wish after all this is over, so where exactly are Mr. Demar and Quayle, I mean I know they\u2019re in the university, but where exactly?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t miss either one of them, Quayle\u2019s located in east section of campus, where you see all the damn buildings phasing in and out. As for Mr. Demar, well I\u2019m sure you can still hear the explosions. I\u2019m going to try to corral at least some of the imps and help Mr. Demar, I\u2019m not going anywhere near the eastside of the campus though. I\u2019m off!\u201d\n\nThe demonologist runs to go do what he said, leaving you with a couple choices of proceeding. You could go try to fix this problem with Quayle since it won\u2019t do anyone any good if the city collapses on itself or disappears to gods know where, of course you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re going to do, hell you\u2019ve never even spoken to Quayle before. He was always kept locked up by himself in his room studying most of the time.\n\nOf course you could go help Mr. Demar, chances are he could solve the problem with Quayle a lot better if he survives.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go deal with Quayle", "result": "Mr. Demar is a powerful wizard and he\u2019s already got help, along with the help you sent and also the help that\u2019s coming.

It\u2019s a mess. You see Catalina watching it all in wonder. She looks at you briefly only to acknowledge your presence and then goes back to watching the changing landscape.\n\n\u201cI see you choose to check on Quayle.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I think he\u2019s in that small gray building over there, the only one that seems to be stable. I can\u2019t get to him though, well at least I\u2019m not risking it, I sent some of my troops in there and I watched them either accelerate in rot and disintegrate, or even stranger actually turn back into their living selves until they eventually became babies and then nothing. In fact I\u2019m getting out of here as it only seems to be getting worse. This plan sucks.\u201d Catalina replies.\n\u201cWell someone\u2019s gotta go in, so I guess I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ve risked too much already to fail. I suggest you go help Mr. Demar.\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWow, this whole thing has really made you really authoritative. You\u2019ve come a long way since Enchantment class.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019ve had a revelation that I\u2019m really good at this necromancy stuff and I won\u2019t be denied my career in it before it\u2019s truly begun.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly grab Catalina and kiss her on the lips; she pushes you away and slaps your face.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?! Just because you\u2019re not incompetent at one thing, doesn\u2019t automatically mean I\u2019m wet for you!\u201d\n\u201cWell let me show you I\u2019m not incompetent in two things then!\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. Maybe later, like next century. Nice try though. But I will go help Mr. Demar seeing as that would be the best course of action for me.

A strange white field of energy surrounds him.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are the future\u2026there is no future\u2026there are many futures\u2026it\u2019s all so fascinating\u2026\u201d he says in an echoed voice.\n\u201cHey Quayle, we pretty much won, you can stop doing whatever it is you\u2019re doing with time now.

You exit the building and begin to walk over to the other side of the campus where the explosions were coming from.\n\nYou\u2019re a little tired, but you feel like you might have to be ready for anything, so you raise more of the dead to protect you for possible battle. It\u2019s almost so easy now; you barely need to concentrate even in this fatigued state.\n\nYou arrive to burning buildings and ruins of towers. Once again you see Catalina standing outside talking to a demonologist. After they leave, Catalina sees you and once again seems unimpressed by you. You think you\u2019re warming up to her.\n\n\u201cHuh, took you long enough. You missed all the major battle while you were playing around with Quayle.\u201d\n\u201cPlaying around? You don\u2019t even want to know what I\u2019ve been through, and I\u2019ll wager it wasn\u2019t nearly as\u2026disturbing as what you went through.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it, by the time I got here Mr. Demar had already lost Felsa, Trelik had betrayed him, and Sebastian was killed. Luckily I was here to provide back up for the final battle with the Dean. We\u2019ve won, but Mr. Demar is very weak right now, I dunno if he\u2019s going to survive his wounds.\u201d\n\u201cShit, sounds like I did miss a lot, so is Trelik dead?\u201d\n\u201cNope, the coward ran off when he realized he couldn\u2019t beat Mr. Demar.\u201d\n\u201cCan I see him?\u201d\n\u201cSure I guess, he\u2019s in library, or what\u2019s left of it.\u201d\n\nYou enter the library briefly remembering when you came in here to seek more necromantic knowledge. Now you have more than you could\u2019ve ever imagined. You see Mr. Demar sitting at a table looking through a book while he winces in pain while clutching his stomach. He\u2019s bloody, as well as burned. He\u2019s a mess.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) This didn\u2019t turn out the way I planned at all. Of course those that follow the dark path never seem to get their way. I wonder why. Is it simple arrogance or is it just the cosmos balancing things out?\u201d he says not looking up.\n\u201cMr. Demar, those wounds, you really should\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know what my mistake was, I was thinking too big. I should\u2019ve concentrated on one dark art. Spread my attention too thin, and this mess was the result. (Cough) Thought I was going to rule it all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour wounds are\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAh fuck it; I knew what I was getting into when I started along this path. I have no regrets other than trusting Trelik. Treacherous bastard. Heed my words, this path is not one of trust. You are truly alone. No matter how powerful you get, there\u2019s always someone seeking to topple you and steal what you have.\u201d\n\u201cMr\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Demar now addresses you directly.\n\n\u201cListen to me; this is your last lesson. At least from me, because for what lies ahead of you will be the greatest test of all. You\u2019re obviously a powerful necromancer, and you\u2019re only going to become more so. You must take advantage of your powers, and do everything you can to survive and crush those who oppose you. If that means war so be it, but if you can achieve this through peace do not be so quick to dismiss it. Chances are this will not be an option for you, but anything is possible. Just never back down. You are a ruler, not a subject. The city is yours if you can hold on to it. The entire world is yours\u2026if you can hold on to it\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Demar collapses on the table. Strange that someone so powerful chose to die, since you get the impression his death could\u2019ve been prevented with some strong healing magic. Did he feel that he failed and death was what he deserved? Was he deep down too cowardly to handle the hardship ahead? Or was he just tired?\n\nYou\u2019ll never know for certain you suppose. You exit the library, where Catalina meets you.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d You reply.\n\nCatalina looks surprised at the bluntness and simplicity of your answer.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose we could do worse\u2026so what\u2019s next fearless leader?\u201d\n\u201cGood question.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Good question indeed. You are about to take your necromantic career to its next level", "result": "Chapter 3: One Foot In The Grave\n\nOne year has passed\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it, but it\u2019s been a year since you took control of Nuro\u2026or rather Aftermath as you renamed it.\n\nThe \u201cNuro Incident\u201d as it came to be known was a shock to the civilized world. Nobody had anticipated such a thing occurring despite all preparations. Certainly not to Nuro given it\u2019s near \u201cinvincible\u201d reputation.\n\nThe Grand Alliance was immediately formed to retake the city, but fortunately for you, you weren\u2019t the only problem they had.\n\nVelzix, a demon lord who soon left Nuro during its attack, managed to unite the rest of the demons that felt the need to break their contract with the Dark Order turned their attention to the Tulan Kingdom. Right now he\u2019s established his own rule, enslaving the population and is most likely planning further conquest assuming he can keep his own troops from fighting each other long enough.\n\nTrelik the \u201cother necromancer\u201d has been rampaging across the countryside in a vain attempt to establish some sort of dominion of his own, but so far without any real allies he\u2019s yet to be successful. His actions have still kept the Grand Alliance and other governments busy however.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019ve already managed to hold off one Grand Alliance attack quite successfully due to your preparations. The first thing you did was command all the surviving Dark Order members to become necromancers. Some of them the more die hard demonologists hated this idea, so you gave them the option of taking their chances with Velzix or alone against the Grand Alliance.\n\nAfter being presented with these two undesirable prospects, they grumbled, but the rest soon fell in line. Catalina was mainly responsible for training them, given that she\u2019s the only other \u201ctrue\u201d necromancer in the city. You\u2019re glad of that as it saved you from having to do everything.\n\nYour relationship with Catalina\u2019s has improved mainly because you\u2019ve proven yourself to be a competent leader that has managed to hold on to the city despite the odds. She still acts like she\u2019s not interested in you, but you catch an extended glance from her every now and then. Oh yeah she\u2019s definitely warming up to you.\n\nYou haven\u2019t heard anything from your family, you can only wonder what they think of all this and in some ways you don\u2019t want to know.\n\nWhile things are somewhat quiet now, that\u2019s not going to last. The Grand Alliance will keep attacking and who knows how long they\u2019ll be distracted with Velzix and Trelik? They may very well overwhelm you in time, if the other threats are taken care of. You can\u2019t just sit in your throne room and prepare for the next attack; you\u2019ll need to be proactive about this threat.\n\nThis of course this means conquest. Your standing army is stronger than ever right now and your powers in necromancy have grown considerably with the last year. You\u2019re confident that you could probably take over a small kingdom. Gaining more territory that your enemy can\u2019t use is usually a good way of making things harder for them.", "action_results": [{"action": "The path of conquest calls", "result": "Ah the time honored the tradition of all true rulers\u2026\n\n\u201cCatalina, I think it\u2019s time we expand.\u201d You say walking into her study.\n\u201cOh you do, do you? Well, there\u2019s no shortage of places. Got somewhere in particular in mind?\u201d\n\u201cA few places, but this is sort of why I\u2019m talking to you, I figure it\u2019ll be good to have your input.\u201d\n\u201cWow, laying it on thick today aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026do you like it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d She says with a faint smile.\n\u201cGood, but seriously I\u2019m thinking we should attack the Brot Kingdom. It\u2019s close, and its military is weak.\u201d\n\u201cNormally I\u2019d agree, but I think you\u2019re forgetting that our former classmate Trelik has currently established a presence there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was thinking we could get rid of him at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cEasier said than done I hope you realize. I know he\u2019s a treacherous asshole that\u2019s been run ragged by the Grand Alliance, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s any less formidable. Not to mention we\u2019ll still have the Brot military to handle and hopefully the Grand Alliance doesn\u2019t show up in the area. Speaking of which, Trelik\u2019s pitiful endeavors have been keeping them busy. Get rid of him and they\u2019ll pay more attention to us.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, where do you think we should attack?\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\nCatalina points to a rather barren area known as the Drozz Wasteland which contains barbaric orc tribes, though ogres, goblins and similar \u201cuncivilized\u201d races dwell there as well.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are we supposed to do with that?\u201d\n\u201cDo you realize how many soldiers we can get in that area? The tribes in there are disorganized and unlikely to give us a meaningful fight. We can suffer minimal losses and gain more than what we started out with. Then we can use those gains against more formidable foes!\u201d\n\u201cCat baby, THAT is not going to be easy. First of all I know something of orcs and the green bastards don\u2019t know when to fucking quit most of the time. Even with the fear of an undead army, I guarantee they\u2019ll still fight. Same thing with the ogres, trolls, minotaurs and GIANTS that live in that area! Giants, Catalina. Fucking giants. Not to mention those tribes have the full advantage of the knowledge of the terrain.\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference does that make? It\u2019s not like our army needs to eat or even sleep! Those tribes are fighting each other most of the time too. By the time we\u2019ve slaughtered half of those mongrel tribes, it\u2019s still unlikely that the rest will unite against us in any meaningful way. You said giants live there and perhaps that will be a challenge, but think about it, we could RAISE those same giants to use against our enemies in the future!\u201d\n\nWhile the idea of raising undead giants is appealing, you still have reservations about attacking the area.\n\nYou have a big decision to make.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack the Brot Kingdom", "result": "As much as raising undead colossuses would be cool, you decide that taking over the Brot Kingdom will be easier and you\u2019ll be able to take out Trelik at the same time.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go with my plan of attacking the Brot Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cYou just want to be all macho and kill Trelik.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026does it turn you on?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. Perhaps if you\u2019re successful. Are you going to do this personally?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t think any of the other necromancers can take on Trelik by themselves, and I\u2019d rather have you here looking after things.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re trusting me to run Aftermath?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, now I want you to keep a good run of things here, and if the Grand Alliance attacks I want to know immediately, so I can get here!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I doubt if that\u2019ll happen. I\u2019d be more concerned with them attacking you when you\u2019re at the Brot Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, okay I\u2019m off.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d she says and quickly kisses you on the cheek before you leave.

By the time you get there you can see the destruction that Trelik has wrought. It\u2019s obvious where he\u2019s been. Some corpses linger around the razed towns he\u2019s obviously been through, but you immediately bring them under your control. It\u2019s apparent that Trelik hasn\u2019t focused on fortifying his holdings too much and he probably wasn\u2019t expecting you to arrive at all.\n\nGiven his weakened state, you wonder if you should bother attacking Trelik immediately. Perhaps you should take out the remaining Brot military just to get them out of the way first seeing as they might be more of a threat.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack Trelik", "result": "Your thirst to get rid of one of your rivals overcomes you and he is closer, so you continue your march towards where he\u2019s located, it doesn\u2019t take long as you just follow the heavier population of undead wandering around.

You catch sight of each other during the battle.\n\n\u201cYou! You\u2019re the cause of my current problems! It should\u2019ve been me to take Nuro! That\u2019s all gonna change today though! You were a fool to come here, you should\u2019ve stayed behind your safe walls!\u201d\n\nWhile Trelik is ranting at you, you choose to take a more active approach and blast him with a beam of negative energy. He falls and temporarily loses control of his undead. You take advantage of it and enforce your own will over them. Trelik\u2019s position isn\u2019t good considering he\u2019s surrounded.\n\n\u201cNO! Don\u2019t follow him, follow me! You\u2019re supposed to follow me! NOOOOO!\u201d are his last words before he\u2019s butchered by his once obedient corpses.\n\n\u201cAll too easy, now let\u2019s finish off the Brot military and take over this place completely.\u201d You remark.\n\nTaking Trelik\u2019s remaining army you march upon the heart of the Brot Kingdom. The place is better defended than you thought, but your numbers are overwhelming and you don\u2019t have to worry about Trelik being at your back. You conquer the Brot Kingdom within a period of a few days. A Grand Alliance army attempts to retake your conquests within the week, but you\u2019ve fortified your position by then and successfully defeat them.\n\nYou leave a few of your most competent necromancers in charge and return to Aftermath in triumph. Catalina meets you.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the update?\u201d\n\u201cI killed Trelik, I conquered the Brot Kingdom, then I kicked the Grand Alliance\u2019s asses.\u201d You say putting your arm around her. She\u2019s not resisting anymore.\n\u201cHmm, sounds like you were very victorious. So now what?\u201d\n\u201cNow what? You and me in the bedroom, that\u2019s what!\u201d\n\nYou and Catalina at last end this little dance and consummate your relationship.\n\nAnd just think all it took was destruction and killing on a grand scale!\n\nFour years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you took control of Aftermath and you\u2019ve made progress. Though not much. Many changes have certainly have come about.\n\nYour territory now encompasses a little more than just Aftermath, but besides the former Brot Kingdom, your other holdings are minor towns that dot the landscape. You call your region the Dead Dominion. The population consists mainly of the dead, with necromancers typically being the only living beings, though there are pockets of living that have pledged their loyalty to you in exchange for mercy. You have granted it. You and Catalina are now truly King and Queen of the dead.\n\nVelzix has benefited a little from your success; he\u2019s managed to hold on to his own realm, but has failed to expand. While he\u2019s stilling having problems of his own, rumors are that he\u2019s attempting to rip open a portal of the largest size to unleash all of the horrors the infernal plane has to offer.\n\nThe Grand Alliance is attempting to handle the pair of you, but has only succeeded in fighting to a stalemate. Rumors are the Zalan Empire is attempting to take full control over the Grand Alliance in order to pursue a more extreme course of action.\n\nYou have not heard anything from you family. You know your Dad\u2019s mercenary company has been fighting in the outskirts of Velzix\u2019s realm. Your sister has become a respected and successful Grand Alliance captain. She\u2019s managed to hold back the tide of your dead horde from gaining anymore ground for a couple years now. As for your Mom, who knows? You\u2019d prefer not to know what she thinks of you.\n\nYou aren\u2019t making anymore progress. You\u2019ve expanded as much as you\u2019re able without making yourself vulnerable. You know you\u2019re going to have to do something soon, but allying with Velzix isn\u2019t an option. Making peace with the Grand Alliance isn\u2019t either.\n\nThe Vampire Clans have unsuccessfully sent assassins after you, but they have all failed. However one night you are visited by another vampire who you almost kill before he begs and insists that he has a message for you from the Clans. He states that they are willing to talk to you. He says he can take you to their secret fortress. That is the only area where Lord Rostov will agree for any types of negotiations to take place.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re open to the possibility of peace talks if it\u2019ll reduce the number of enemies you have, though Catalina is wary of this.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill the messenger", "result": "Catalina\u2019s right, you can\u2019t take the chance of trusting these bloodsucking bastards.

And much like those two, you\u2019ve set yourself on a course that will end badly like it did for them.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and now it looks like that\u2019s all finally coming to an end.\n\nVelzix never quite managed to succeed in his plan to open up the portal, and was struck down by your Dad\u2019s mercenary company of all things.

The Grand Alliance has had many problems with you, though those should be coming to an end soon I should think.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re gonna kill me?\u201d you ask, expecting trouble.\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s a rather blunt assumption, but I suppose a possible one. However, that need not be the case. That is why I have called you to talk.\u201d\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\u201cYes. What I\u2019m offering is for you to give up your mad plan of murdering the world in exchange for immortality.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying if you give up your plan, you may stay here and become one of us.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really know what to say at this point.\n\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026I mean why would you offer this?\u201d\n\u201cAh, a valid question. Well, as you know we\u2019ve been monitoring you. So far you\u2019ve outlasted far longer than you should have, showing that you are a survivor and a man who can thrive under pressure. I personally respect such traits. You would be a fine addition to the clans and quite frankly I wouldn\u2019t mind having someone new to talk to. Trust me these lot haven\u2019t said anything interesting for a LONG time.\u201d Lord Rostov says dismissively to his silent court.\n\u201cWhile your offer has some appeal, I still don\u2019t know. I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201dWhy the hesitation? You are a necromancer, is not immortality not your ultimate goal? And this is the only way you\u2019re going to achieve it my friend, for even if I choose to let you go, you will not last too much longer out there. As I speak the Grand Alliance will be pursuing a more efficient way to deal with you and that ignorant demon Velzix. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that we do have influence over the mortal world and we are setting things up to defend the status quo. A demonic playground and a graveyard are unacceptable outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that, but you keep saying that I\u2019m going to murder the world. I don\u2019t necessarily have any desire to do that. I mean I\u2019ve been just trying to defend myself for the most part. If I could live in peace with the civilized nations I wouldn\u2019t be attempting to take anymore territory. In fact I haven\u2019t for a long time. I mean you said you had influence. Couldn\u2019t we just come to an understanding and you pull some strings to get the Grand Alliance to leave me alone?\u201d\n\nLord Rostov laughs at your proposal.\n\n\u201cEven I cannot do that, even if I chose to do so! The living will always distrust and be repulsed by the undead. They would continue to attack even if we used our influence to cause a change in attitudes and policies. And I would not do so anyway. You are too much of a danger to the world. You claim you do not wish to turn the world into a mass grave, and you may even believe it. But how long really will you be able to contain your nature? You won\u2019t. Just as we cannot contain our nature either.\u201d\n\u201cWell if you feel I\u2019m so dangerous, why keep me alive at all, let alone turn me into a vampire?\u201d\n\u201cBecause as I have said, you are worthy of such a gift and you would be someone new to talk to. Not to mention if you haven\u2019t noticed, our numbers are no longer what they once were, and they\u2019re even less due to our failed assassination attempts. It would be nice to get them back up again. And if you were to become one of us, your need to kill the entire world would lose its appeal. After all you cannot kill your food supply without killing yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cYes. And just think, you\u2019ll still achieve immortality and in a much better form. Do you really want to be a rotting skeletal lich? Also, you can still control the world; we shall always have our hand in guiding the ways of our livestock. That is why we need more of us, so we can once again gain total control over them. You are being offered a better deal than you could ever achieve yourself. What will your answer be?\u201d\n\nLord Rostov has basically given you an \u201cout\u201d as it were. A rather generous one, almost too generous. You can\u2019t help but think he doesn\u2019t have an angle. Still, he\u2019s making a lot of sense.\n\n\u201c\u2026Catalina\u2026may she join me?\u201d\n\u201cAh yes. Your mate. I suppose so. Assuming she wishes to join you. So I take it, you are accepting my offer?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes I am.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. You will see that this was the best choice, now you may feel a slight sting\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you know what Lord Rostov means, you are suddenly grabbed from behind and bitten in the neck by a vampiress. You feel your blood drain from your body and soon your life fades completely.\n\nYour heart ceases beating and then you die.\n\nA few hours pass and you rise again.

Lord Rostov stands by to watch you get up.\n\n\u201cWelcome to your new life, now you may go attempt to convince your mate, but be quick about it, I will have further orders for you.\u201d\n\nYou nod and head back to Aftermath where you meet Catalina in your new superior form. She can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cYOU WENT AHEAD AND DID THIS WITHOUT ME?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I was thinking about us the whole time! I mean why do you think I came back for you? We can have it all and we can have it together!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m sure Lord Rostov has offered this gift out of the goodness his rotten heart. Didn\u2019t you think he has a hidden agenda?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he does, but look we can\u2019t fight them in our current state. If we go this route we can possibly be in a position where we can defend ourselves better. We won\u2019t have to worry about the Grand Alliance or any of that anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just a lot of shifty vampires probably all trying to plot against each other.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but if we\u2019re together we can handle it. Come with me Catalina, I want us to be together in this.\u201d\n\nCatalina thinks silently about it for a moment, and then allows you to embrace her where you begin to drain her blood. You feel completely invigorated by doing this, possibly because you have such a strong bond with her. She soon dies and after you wait a few hours, she rises again. She now will remain forever beautiful.\n\n\u201cAre you ready my dear?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nYou and Catalina return to vampire fortress via black cube and begin your new lives.\n\nYears pass and things change thanks to the influence of the vampire clans. Influence you played a part in.\n\nVelzix never quite managed to succeed in his plan to open up the portal, and was struck down by your Dad\u2019s mercenary company of all things. Your Dad died during the battle and he was declared a hero who sacrificed all in the cause of good. A statue of him now stands in the Zalan Empire\u2019s capital. Funny how mad men can be made into heroes so easily. Lord Rostov asked if you wanted to have the statue taken down, but you declined. It made your Mom happy.\n\nYour own dominion soon fell into disarray without your guidance. Many necromancers attempted to take your place, but ultimately the Grand Alliance army lead by your sister crushed them all and retook everything that once was under your control.\n\nThe status quo is soon restored and the puppet master weavings of the Vampire Clans continue.\n\nYou and Catalina will have other journeys during this new life, but your journey as a necromancer is over.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Attack the Brot military", "result": "You march your horde toward the heart of the Brot Kingdom where Trelik hasn\u2019t been yet. You find that it\u2019s a little better defended than you thought.

This probably would\u2019ve went quicker however, had Trelik not been launching his own attacks at your back and stealing some of your troops.\n\nAnother week passes and you finally complete your attack on the Brot Kingdom. You manage to drive off Trelik, but fail to kill him. You also end up having to fend off a Grand Alliance attack which further weakens you.\n\nYour resources are stretched out and you\u2019ve lost many of your necromancers to help support a large army. It\u2019s draining much of your energy just to maintain your defenses. You send a message to Catalina asking if there\u2019s anyway to get reinforcements, but she replies that doing so would be unwise as the Grand Alliance has sent another army on the way to Aftermath.\n\nYou decide to maintain a skeleton crew as it were in the Brot Kingdom and head back to Aftermath post haste. You arrive just in time to defend Aftermath, which you do successfully\u2026barely. At this point you\u2019re running on empty and you have to rest to recharge yourself. All of this has been a greater ordeal than you thought and it\u2019s only going to get greater.\n\nFour years pass\nIt\u2019s been five years since you took Aftermath, and you\u2019ve made little progress. In fact you sense the end is near and you\u2019ll be happy about it because this has been a miserable time and you wonder what the hell you were thinking all those years ago when you pursued this path\u2026\n\nWhen Velzix was finally defeated, the Grand Alliance was able to focus the full brunt of its attention towards you, leaving you in a perpetual state of being on the defensive. Never again were able to attempt another act of conquest and over the years you eventually lost the Brot Kingdom.\n\nVampire assassins from the clans made multiple attempts on your life. You barely fought them off. The last attack left you horribly scarred; it was only due to Catalina\u2019s sacrifice that you survived.

Of course you actually have to kill them first.\n\n\u201cAlright Catalina, we\u2019ll go with this plan, but I\u2019m going to do it personally, so you\u2019re in charge of things here for awhile.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re not only following my advice, but you\u2019re also trusting me to run Aftermath?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m whipped, now I want you to keep a good run of things here, and if the Grand Alliance attacks I want to know immediately, so I can get here!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I doubt if that\u2019ll happen. They\u2019ve been preoccupied with Velzix lately.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, y\u2019know we\u2019ll have to do something about him too later, but first I guess I got some barbarians to kill.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d she says and quickly kisses you on the cheek before you leave.

Incorporeal undead shall work better. You need speed, and the tribes will probably have little in the way of magic to combat you. You also take a couple extra necromancers with you along with your army of ghosts, spirits and wraiths.\n\nYou make pretty good time and suffer no attacks on the way, probably because of the rather low profile and somewhat hard to see aspects of your army. When you arrive in the Drozz region, it\u2019s night, but still as desolate as you remember it. Your Dad took you here a couple times during his attempts to \u201ctoughen\u201d you up when he still thought he could turn you into a warrior. You hated it then, and you hate the place now.\n\nAfter casting a sense life spell, you start to head towards the direction of the nearest tribe, but your uncanny connection with death lets you know that you\u2019re being watched and not by the living\u2026\n\nSuddenly from over a small hill top a group of misshapened creatures pop their heads up. After what looks to be chatter between the creatures, they lope in your direction. Ghouls. One of the filthier forms of undead. Typically they were created by vampires, who used to use them as tougher servants. (Basically mortals who weren\u2019t \u201cworthy\u201d enough for the gift of vampirism) but that would mean that there\u2019s a vampire in the area.\n\nYou don\u2019t have time to think too hard about it, you just react and dominate your will over the ghouls. For some reason they\u2019re very resistant to you and you\u2019re forced to destroy them. More ghouls appear however, and soon you\u2019re surrounded.\n\n\u201cWhere the fuck are these things coming from?\u201d one of your necros asks.\n\u201cStay calm. Don\u2019t lose control\u2026VAMPIRE! SHOW YOURSELF! If you\u2019re going to assassinate me, I would\u2019ve thought the clans were at least honorable enough to not rely on ghouls!\u201d you shout.\n\nYour shouting is soon answered. The ghouls suddenly stop and a hideous figure appears on the same hilltop. He then walks towards you and your army and stops not to far from it. He\u2019s fearless and shows no signs of being concerned of your presence.\n\n\n\n\u201cClans? Don\u2019t speak to me of the clans! I was cast out long ago for my actions! Once I feasted upon the blood of royalty, with legions of mortals willing to die for me. Now I feast upon the carrion of barbarians with only ghouls as company.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re an outcast? I thought all you types of vampires degenerated into mindless beasts much like the ghouls.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Do you not think this is degeneration enough? I can\u2019t even make another vampire anymore. But you are quite correct. Most of us did. One thing keeps me going though and kept my mind sharp. Revenge. I vowed I would get revenge on the Clans somehow. Of course the reality is, I\u2019ve had to hide in a hole in the ground while my ghouls scavenge the countless battlefields of this accursed place. I am the Ghoul King.\u201d\n\u201cGhoul King eh? I\u2019m very surprised nobody\u2019s hunted you.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t survived this long by being sloppy. The only ones who tend to be around here are barbarians and if any of them ever see us, it\u2019s their last time. But the tribes tend to be an anti-social lot anyway, so it\u2019s unlikely that any of them run to tell the civilized folks that there are ghouls and their king infesting the area. So what of you? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a necromancer\u2026a long time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m attempting to supplement my army as it were. These tribes would make excellent additions. Especially the giants.\u201d\n\u201cI see. So you mean to take away my food source? Not to mention my OWN supply of followers. These ghouls don\u2019t grow from trees you know!\u201d\n\nThis is an interesting situation. You didn\u2019t expect this, but perhaps you can use it to your advantage. This \u201cGhoul King\u201d is close enough to you to attack with your troops. Chances are, if you killed him, you could take his remaining horde of ghouls to help you destroy the tribes in the area.\n\nHowever, maybe you could use a little diplomacy.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill the Ghoul King", "result": "Why mess around with a middle man, when you can control the ghouls yourself?\n\nYou order your troops to attack, at which point the Ghoul King orders his ghouls to do likewise, as he attempts to slaughter his way through your army to get to you!\n\n\u201cLittle necromancer, did you really think you could intimidate me? I am still more than a match for a mere mortal!\u201d he mocks as jumps and leaps towards you.\n\nYour troops have no noticeable effect on him. Their draining powers do nothing, though the scythes of the wraiths do some damage. You have to use non-necromantic magic against him and you cast a fireball into his chest.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to cause him to leap away from you and attempt to roll out the flame, but he kills two of your necromancers in the process. His ghouls are getting wiped out by your undead, but they\u2019re coming like hordes of lemmings, you have to kill the Ghoul King now.\n\n\u201cBlast the bloodsucker with fire!\u201d you order your last remaining necromancers to do. Fortunately being ex-demonologists, their knowledge of fire magic is still quite strong. The Ghoul King attempts to leap out of the way, but the flame spells still hit him. He runs around burning and howling horribly.\n\nSoon the wraiths put a final end to the Ghoul King with their scythes. The rest of the ghouls seeing their King dead, begin to run away in multiple directions. You manage to easily dominate most of them and corral them into your fold.\n\nNot too bad, though losing a couple of necros wasn\u2019t something you wanted. At least not so early. You press on with your quest to conquer the Drozz tribes.\n\nWeeks turn into months and your campaign there is going\u2026mediocre. You did alright in the beginning, but after awhile the tribes began to unite in a way you didn\u2019t think they would or at least you\u2019d think it would take longer. While mostly low in magic, they had more shaman and witch doctor types than you expected as well. They also know to start targeting you and your other necromancers whenever possible, which has resulted in you being the only one left and supporting the entire undead army. Given how long you\u2019ve been without rest, lack of other magical enhancers, the constant drain and the large number of undead you\u2019re controlling, you could be over exerting yourself.\n\nYour time here hasn\u2019t really been profitable. You\u2019ve gained more troops, but you\u2019ve lost necromancers and you still haven\u2019t really conquered the area.

You\u2019ve been forced to hide out from the world in a hole in the ground. Wouldn\u2019t you at least like that to change? Even if you die, at least you can say you tried! Changes ARE coming to this world, and this is your chance to be on the winning side.\u201d\n\nThe Ghoul King looks in the sky. His expression reminds you of delegate Yolev\u2019s when Mr. Demar gave him a chance to join.

However, there\u2019s no fool like an old one. What more can be done to me? I\u2019ve lost all as it is, I can only gain. I\u2019m listening more to your proposal, but let\u2019s have some details. I won\u2019t ally with someone that\u2019s as foolish as me.\u201d\n\nYou quickly explain that the Ghoul King should attack the tribes like he\u2019s been doing, but to just increase the frequency. All you ask is that he leave a portion of the dead for you (rather than eating them) to use as troops. You will leave one of your necromancers here as an emissary and transporter as it were.\n\nThe Ghoul King finds this arrangement to be acceptable. He laughs when you say you would also like it if he managed to kill some giants for you to raise.

What\u2019s with this girl? One minute she\u2019s expressing interest, the next she\u2019s pissed at you. Oh well.

He tells you that he\u2019s got something special for you. Something that Hessan can\u2019t transport himself. You make your way back to Drozz, traveling invisibly for the most part, since last you heard, the Grand Alliance ousted Trelik from the Brot Kingdom and are currently stationed there, probably planning to attack you next.\n\nWhen you arrive, the Ghoul King meets you.\n\n\u201cWell don\u2019t say I haven\u2019t held up my part of this alliance.

You concentrate again and one by one each one stands up and fully obedient to you. It requires very little energy on your part surprisingly. You must be growing in power.\n\n\u201cWell now, I guess you can walk the walk! Alright now you go have fun with those big boys. I have some barbarians to terrorize. It seems I\u2019ve inadvertently united most of the tribes against me with this giant killing business.\u201d\n\u201cYou need some help?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I got it all under control. I was sick of hiding anyway. Thanks though. Especially for making me feel like a true vampire again rather than a running scavenger.\u201d\n\nYou tell Hessan to stay with the Ghoul King as you still need someone here in Drozz. One day you\u2019ll have to construct some sort of portal between here and Aftermath, but that will have to be later. Right now you\u2019ve got undead giants and you\u2019re all prepared to use them right away. You remember The Grand Alliance is in the Brot Kingdom and tthat they\u2019re probably still recovering from battling Trelik recently.\n\nYou march with your undead giants to the Brot Kingdom. You have no back up, just you. You\u2019re going to show them all what you\u2019re capable of\u2026\n\nYour arrival isn\u2019t surprising since they could see you coming from quite a few miles away, but the utter fear you inspired was immense and there still wasn\u2019t enough time for the Grand Alliance to get reinforcements.\n\nYour undead giants smash and destroy buildings. They crush knights under foot. The carnage is great. You supplement your attack by raising the recent dead to your cause. Graveyards are your reinforcements.\n\nYou see the remnants of Grand Alliance flee. Let them flee. Let them speak of the terror and the death!\n\nThe news of what you did travels fast, and Catalina runs to meet you when you arrive back in Aftermath.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing risking your life like that? You should\u2019ve come back to Aftermath for more soldiers before taking on the Brot Kingdom AND the Grand Alliance all by yourself!\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Were you worried about me?\u201d you smile.\n\u201cWell\u2026 um\u2026no! But, you should\u2019ve told me!\u201d\n\u201cI did tell you. I told you I had everything worked out and look\u2026I did.\u201d You say putting your arm around her. She\u2019s not resisting anymore.\n\n\u201cHmmm, well I guess you did. So now what?\u201d\n\u201cNow what? You and me in the bedroom, that\u2019s what!\u201d\n\nYou and Catalina at last end this little dance and consummate your relationship.\n\nAnd just think all it took was destroying an entire kingdom with some undead giants!\n\n\nFour years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you took control of Aftermath and you\u2019ve made progress. Many changes have certainly have come about.\n\nYour territory now encompasses far more than just Aftermath. You now control several former kingdoms. You call your region the Dead Dominion. The population consists mainly of the dead, with necromancers typically being the only living beings, though there are pockets of living that have pledged their loyalty to you in exchange for mercy. You have granted it. You and Catalina are now truly King and Queen of the dead.\n\nVelzix has benefited from your success, due to the excessive problems you\u2019ve given the Grand Alliance; he\u2019s expanded his own realm relatively unchecked. Minor conflict has come about between your respective domains, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before all out war occurs. Rumors are that he\u2019s attempting to rip open a portal of the largest size to unleash all of the horrors the infernal plane has to offer.\n\nThe Grand Alliance is attempting to handle the pair of you, but has only succeeded in fighting to a stalemate. Rumors are the Zalan Empire is attempting to take full control over the Grand Alliance in order to pursue a more extreme course of action.\n\nYou have not heard anything from you family. You know your Dad\u2019s mercenary company has been fighting in the outskirts of Velzix\u2019s realm. Your sister has become a respected and successful Grand Alliance captain. She\u2019s managed to hold back the tide of your dead horde from gaining anymore ground for a couple years now. As for your Mom, who knows? You\u2019d prefer not to know what she thinks of you.\n\nThe Vampire Clans have unsuccessfully sent assassins after you, but they have all failed. The Ghoul King suggests that an attack should be made on them soon. He mentions he knows where their secret fortress is and now that he has the support he wishes to take his revenge. He has completely conquered Drozz and turned into a true Kingdom (The only one semi-independent from your Dead Dominion) no longer does he hide in a hole.\n\nAs for Trelik, you have heard nothing. For all you know he may be dead. He disappeared soon after his defeat at Brot four years ago.\n\nBut today is another day and with that new problems come. You have to decide which new direction you\u2019re going to steer your Dominion.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack Velzix", "result": "Sometimes it takes a \u201cbad guy\u201d to take out another bad guy, maybe even two\u2026\n\n\u201cCatalina I think it\u2019s time to attack Velzix.\u201d You say walking into her study.\n\u201cOh you do huh?

You realize that the Grand Alliance has been trying to chop his head off for years and they haven\u2019t been successful.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well they ain\u2019t me. Besides I got an angle. My Dad\u2019s mercenary company is over there right now. I can get help from him.\u201d\n\nCatalina looks at you as if you\u2019ve gone completely insane.\n\n\u201cYour Dad?

He probably has good intelligence on the realm. Besides, he\u2019s an opportunist first of all. If Velzix wins. We all lose. BUT if I win, well just maybe I\u2019ll take sentimental mercy on the old man and the family.\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Catalina asks.\n\u201cWith my Mom and sis? Sure.\u201d You grin.\n\u201cI dunno about this family stuff, sometimes I\u2019m glad I was an orphan.\u201d Catalina sighs. \u201cBut if you think it\u2019s worth a shot, you should try it. It\u2019s not like we have too much of an advantage over Velzix. I worry that we\u2019ll expend too much power in an attempt to destroy him, leaving us open for a Grand Alliance attack.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really not worried about the Grand Alliance. They\u2019re suffering from their own internal squabbles from what I\u2019ve heard and if I do this the way I think it might go, we won\u2019t need to waste one corpse on Velzix\u2019s realm. Okay, as usual you\u2019re going to be in charge of things while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nYou kiss Catalina goodbye and make your way to Velzix\u2019s realm alone\u2026\n\nVelzix\u2019s realm is appropriately a wretched place. Sure there is death here, but none of its purity or beauty exists. Demons torment the mortal population with much delight. You get a few attempts to torment you and you teach them a fatal lesson. You stay invisible while you can though.\n\n\nUsing a few ghostly scouts and a couple of minor divination spells (Thank the gods Catalina\u2019s been around to help you with other types of magic!) you soon determine the exact location of your Dad.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to expect, you haven\u2019t seen him in years. When you approach the camp, you\u2019re immediately met by guards.\n\n\u201cHALT!

While you\u2019re powerful, you can\u2019t fight Velzix\u2019s seemingly endless reinforcement of demons. You land some good hits, but ultimately you\u2019re overwhelmed.\n\n\nVelzix picks up your drained bloody body to mock you one last time.\n\n\u201cSince you took the effort to come visit me personally, perhaps I\u2019ll pay that little queen of yours a visit personally too.

You have to move some necromancers into the Drozz region to take command there, which stretches you out a bit, since you didn\u2019t need to worry about it so directly before, having the Ghoul King there and all.\n\nAfter years of fighting a three way stalemate, at last one side makes progress and unfortunately it\u2019s Velzix.

He declares all out war on the entire world determined to turn it into the same hell he once called home.\n\nThe Grand Alliance attempts to stop him, but is soon crushed.

We\u2019ll do this, but after Velzix is dead, me and you end this father and son time got me?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\n\nAs your Dad proceeds to lead to where Velzix dwells, he explain the layout of it. He says they\u2019ve gone in there before, but have never stayed too long.

Why are they relying on some broken down ex-cuthroat?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI told ya, they have sent hero types after Velzix before, but he\u2019s defeated them every time. As for larger military concerns, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that they happen, but it\u2019s a question of balance. They can\u2019t attack Velzix, like they probably would prefer since they know that YOU would take advantage of their weakened state! Not to mention the Grand Alliance finds you to be a bigger threat. The world was almost consumed once already by some megalomaniacal necromancer, they don\u2019t want that to happen again. So little groups like mine fuck things up for Velzix, just enough to keep him occupied and doesn\u2019t gain anymore ground.\u201d\n\u201cActually I\u2019m not a megalomaniac. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t have some desire to turn the world into a graveyard.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh well I guess all those kingdoms were just you being neighborly eh? What about that first attack on the Brot Kingdom? Those big ass undead giants? Hordes of undead troops slaughtering men, women and children?\u201d\n\u201cI did what I had to do to defend myself. War isn\u2019t pretty. People die.\u201d\n\u201cTrue\u2026but I still fail to see where yer NOT being a megalomaniac.\u201d\n\u201cI told you I\u2019m defending my dominion! If the Grand Alliance would stop attacking me, I wouldn\u2019t pursue anymore territory. I\u2019d be happy to live in peace, side by side. Why do you think I want to get rid Velzix? I\u2019m hoping after he\u2019s gone that I can come to some agreement with the Grand Alliance! Because in the end it isn\u2019t going to be good for anyone!\u201d\n\u201cFancy words\u2026but I question if that\u2019s what you really want. I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time, but within the short time I\u2019ve talked with you now, even I can see a change in you. You have a lot of desire, somewhere within you, you want to control everything so there\u2019s no possibility of anything ever hurting you.

Some more of Velzix\u2019s guard arrive and seeing their leader in pieces, they run off. You tell your revenants to hunt them down and fulfill their need for revenge.\n\nJust you and Dad now. He lies against the wall broken and bloody. He\u2019s very near death. He\u2019s hardly the imposing figure that instilled fear in you when you were little.\n\n\u201c\u2026fuck\u2026I coulda had that demon bastard if I\u2019d been younger.\u201d He growls.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you could\u2019ve.\u201d\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m all fucked up\u2026guess this is a good day for you. One rival dead and me soon to join him.\u201d\n\u201cOddly, I don\u2019t feel too much of anything right now. I probably would\u2019ve taken joy in your death at one time, but not now. I\u2019m not sure what that means though.\u201d\n\nYour Dad just grunts at your answer, before saying one last thing.\n\n\u201cHeh, you chopped that bastard\u2019s head off. No magic tricks. Just visceral physical violence\u2026you impressed me\u2026\u201d\n\nYour Dad dies with those last words. A violent end for a violent man. You wonder why he felt the need to praise you before he died though. Guilt? Regret? Genuine respect? Did he think that by giving you \u201cvalidation\u201d you might change your ways? Perhaps he felt responsible for your path in some way?\n\nWhatever the reason, you dismiss it all. You chose this path for yourself. Nobody else. Whatever you\u2019ve done, or are going to do it\u2019ll be because you chose to do it.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Can\u2019t say it was a pleasure Dad, but I guess you were finally alright in the end.\u201d You say and cast a small fireball spell to burn his body.\n\nYou make your way back to Aftermath where Catalina meets you. Catalina asks you what happened exactly in Velzix\u2019s realm and you tell her the truth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like I said Cat baby, I went in there and chopped Velzix\u2019s head off. And then my Dad died.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Wow. Are you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well I guess I should tell you, the Ghoul King has been itching to strike against the Vampire Clans and he says that he\u2019s going to do it, with or without your direct help.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll go meet him. Might as well get rid of another enemy today.\u201d\n\nCatalina stops you before you leave again.\n\n\u201cReally, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re by my side. Of course I\u2019m okay. I want you to start making arrangements to take over Velzix\u2019s territory. When word gets out that he\u2019s dead, the Grand Alliance will be all over it, So let\u2019s get a head start before they do.\u201d You say and kiss her goodbye.\n\nSoon you go meet the Ghoul King in at his \u201cKingdom\u201d in the Drozz region. Other than the small castle he erected and the ghouls that now roam openly and freely, the area doesn\u2019t look too much different.\n\nWhen you arrive, he gives a big pointy toothed smile while his hordes of his ghouls wait around.\n\n\u201cWell now, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d see you. When I spoke to Catalina she mentioned you were having a big show down with Velzix! I trust that went well then, since you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cYep, he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! Excellent! I guess after this little foray, we\u2019ll only have the Grand Alliance to worry about!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to worry about them at all actually.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be right\u2026so are you ready to go? I\u2019ve been lusting for this revenge for years, so if you don\u2019t mind, I want to kill Lord Rostov myself.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem GK, I\u2019ll just be here as support. So where is this Vampire hideout anyway, you never did tell me. How long will it take us to get there?\u201d\n\u201cOh I can get us there real quick. I still have the magic key to teleport there. I\u2019ve enhanced its power to transport several of us to invade. As for its location, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that it\u2019s hidden by powerful magic, but its site is in the Deshun Mountains.\u201d The Ghoul King explains while pulling out a small ebony cube\n\u201cHm, good location. Remote, treacherous terrain, nobody climbing up there. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nBefore you know it, The Ghoul King presses a button on the cube and you and he materialize in the foyer of a large fortress. No ghouls with you though.\n\n\u201cSHIT! This was supposed to transport all of us!\u201d he shouts, before suddenly quieting his voice.\n\u201cYeah, well magic never works out like you want it to half the time. Let\u2019s just get on with it. I\u2019ve already killed a Demon lord today, I\u2019m hardly worried about some decadent bloodsuckers\u2026no offense.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken\u2026but here. Take this.\u201d The Ghoul King hands you a brass ring with several small rubies embedded in it. \u201cWear it. It\u2019s imbued with magic that will protect you from the gaze of Lord Rostov.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m a fucking necromancer; I think I\u2019m a little more strong willed than the average mortal. The stares of some vampire aren\u2019t going to make me go all to mush.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I still say you should wear it. Lord Rostov is very old and he is more powerful than the average vampire and can be tremendously influential. While you may also be powerful you are still mortal and all the weakness that entails\u2026no offense.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Wear the ring", "result": "You figure it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry so you slip the ring on your finger.

Now I have gained it back by stopping another one. I did want revenge at one time\u2026but as I said Lord Rostov is a very influential vampire. My lost status was more appealing than revenge or destroying the world. I regret nothing, but I do thank you. For without you, none of this would\u2019ve been possible and I still would\u2019ve been living like an animal in a hole. Thanks to you no more shall I have to be known as the Ghoul King.\u201d\n\nThe Ghoul King then whispers one last thing to you.\n\n\u201cAnd my thanks will extend to giving you a quick death before Lord Rostov arrives.\u201d\n\nThe Ghoul King then with his powerful claws smashes your skull in while you lie helplessly on the floor.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Do not wear the ring", "result": "\u201cNah, I don\u2019t need this ring, but thanks anyway GK.

Let\u2019s go\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Ghoul King is getting noticeably agitated.\n\n\u201cLook! He\u2019ll be coming soon just put the fucking ring on, before he gets here!\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re getting agitated.\n\n\u201cGK, you better just calm the fuck down. I don\u2019t like being told what to do, unless it\u2019s by Catalina in the bedroom. So\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn you! We\u2019ll do this the old fashioned way then!\u201d he shouts and attacks!\n\nWith one powerful blow he knocks you to the floor. You\u2019re still shaking off the cobwebs by the time he\u2019s ready to land a killing strike. He\u2019s stopped by Lord Rostov however.\n\n\u201cThat will do Ghoul King. His mortal life is not for yours to take.\u201d Rostov says calmly while entering the foyer with a small group of female vampires.\n\u201cI told you to stop calling me that! I have delivered my end of the bargain! You promised me that my status would be restored!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you attempted to kill him, when I specifically told you I wanted him alive. You were not completely dedicated to your end of the deal. So while you may continue to stay in the glory of my presence, I think you\u2019ll still remain the Ghoul King.\u201d\n\nThe Ghoul King looks like he\u2019s about to argue, but instead he submits.\n\n\u201cYes, Lord Rostov.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha ha. You sad sack of shit. Selling me out to be Lord Rostov\u2019s bitch, some deal you made.\u201d You say while getting back up.\n\nLord Rostov now turns his attention towards you. He looks exactly like what you always heard vampires are supposed to look like. Regal, refined, confident and arrogant as all hell.\n\n\u201cDo not judge the Ghoul King too harshly; his actions were based on survival. True he did long for revenge at one time, but when I came to him with this\u2026arrangement, he jumped at the chance because in the end the Ghoul King has always chosen his own survival over anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThen he\u2019s failed miserably in that endeavor because he won\u2019t be surviving this.\u201d\n\u201cI fail to see how idle threats are going to help you right now. In fact this situation would be unnecessary if you hadn\u2019t pursued this path. You only have yourself to blame. Causing chaos and destroying the natural order of things. Ending all life on this world is simply unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026(Sigh) Why is everyone assuming that? I\u2019m PROTECTING myself! Look, I know you still have the puppet master strings going on in the mortal realm. Shit, you\u2019re probably responsible for the Grand Alliance. I\u2019d even be willing to live in peace with the civilized world if they\u2019d stop attacking me!\u201d\n\u201cI once heard the same thing from another of you ilk long ago. We all did. It\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re in this state we are today. You\u2019re growing more powerful with each death you bring. Whether you know it or not, you\u2019re already addicted to the power. You\u2019re addicted to death. Do you REALLY think you can stop yourself at this point? You won\u2019t. You can\u2019t deny your nature no more than we can deny ours. The Great Lich Lord didn\u2019t stop, and neither will you. The status quo must be kept and for that to happen, you have to die.\u201d\n\n\nWith those words, Lord Rostov uses his supernatural speed before you can react and prompty breaks your neck.\n\nYour heart stops beating.\nYour lungs stop drawing breath.\nYou fall to the floor dead.\n\n\u201cBest to take care of these things quickly. Remember the lessons of poor Duke Tolov who\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile Lord Rostov is pontificating about his predecessor, your body undergoes a change. You body is regenerating. The bones in your neck have re-knitted. You open your eyes; your heart is still not beating. You draw no breath, yet you\u2019re still alive. You feel more knowledgeable in the ways of magic and death in particular.\n\nYou are the Great Lich Lord reborn\u2026and you are pissed.\n\nYou immediately get up and launch a fireball into Lord Rostov\u2019s back. He howls in pain before you cause his heart to explode in his chest, followed by his brain. He falls uselessly on to the ground. His nights of existence are over.\n\nThe other vampires in the immediate area sound an alarm, but you\u2019re not worried. A few manage to attack you and land some deep blows, but you feel nothing but numbness. Then you strike back.\n\nYou begin to dominate all of their minds. Your powers have grown to an extent that you\u2019re able to directly control even intelligent undead like these. You don\u2019t even want to dirty your hands with dealing with these miserable blood leeches. You cause them all to gruesomely attack one another, until you\u2019re ultimately the last one standing in a fortress filled with dismembered vampires, well one still lives. He still struggles against your mind control, but he knows the end will soon come. He even welcomes it at this point.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have done it GK. You had everything. Now only oblivion awaits you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. This world is going to end soon; I\u2019d rather die before I see that happen. How will it feel when the world is finally under your utter command? What will you do when there is nothing left? Will you be able to be satisfied on just continued existence?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll find out, because you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou cause the Ghoul King to rip his own heart out and bite into it before setting him and the rest of them on fire.\n\nWith all the bloodsuckers dead you leave the burning fortress and transport yourself back to Aftermath. When you return Aftermath, Catalina sees your wounds and unnecessarily worries about you.\n\n\u201cBaby, you\u2019re wounded!\u201d\n\u201cCatalina, I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 dead.\u201d You say sharply and enter your study.\n\nYou retire to your study where you put your vampire ordeal out of your mind and reflect upon what will come next while you write a letter to your Mom and Sister about Dad. You figure they should know the truth even if nobody else will.\n\nEven in this new state of existence, you\u2019re so tired\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Once again you enter a new stage of your journey", "result": "Chapter 4: Even Death May Die\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and many changes have come about.\n\nWithout Velzix\u2019s brutal leadership, his realm soon broke apart. Demon leaders fought amongst themselves and became easier to deal with for the Grand Alliance. Little by little territory was liberated. However you were not idle and you also took pieces of Velzix\u2019s former territory.\n\nDue to all the problems caused by Velzix a new order was enacted by the Grand Alliance. No more chances are being taken and the civilized world has a zero tolerance policy on demons. Demons are to be killed on sight anywhere they are found. Even the so called \u201cnice ones\u201d. Any government found tolerating their presence will be found guilty of demonology and invaded.\n\nThis lead to a few misguided liberal types claiming that it was infringing on certain rights, but considering the increasingly draconian Zalan Empire had pretty much taken complete control over the Grand Alliance at this point, they had final say in the matter and executed all such protestors. The Grand Alliance is now merely a name much like Vampire Clans. In reality, it\u2019s the \u201cZalan Empire and its little friends that better do what it says Alliance\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of the Vampire Clans, since your total destruction of their last remaining enclave, their influence has completely left this world. You\u2019ve noticed a reduced effectiveness in Grand Alliance strategy because of this despite that they\u2019ve become more united in recent years. Except for the near mindless bestial ones that roam the countryside they\u2019re effectively extinct. Still, you feel no need to show them mercy and bring them under your control. When one is found, you have it destroyed. The treachery of the Ghoul King has brought this genocide upon their \u201crace.\u201d\n\nYour letter to your family was never replied to, but you are aware it was received. You don\u2019t know exactly how the truth was spun, or who exactly was involved. But you do know your Dad has a statue erected of him in the Zalan capital stating how he nobly gave his life fighting Velzix. Funny how mad men can be turned into heroes so easily.\n\nYour sister is a general of a Grand Alliance army now, which of course continues to attack you despite some of your attempts at coming to some sort of peace agreement.\n\nThe fools won\u2019t even listen to reason. There\u2019s no way the Grand Alliance can win this war. You\u2019ve only been growing in power and show no signs of stopping. Even with their stabilized internal struggles under the Zalan Empire\u2019s iron fist they still won\u2019t be able to defeat you. The world has gone mad and you\u2019re the only one making sense anymore. They call you a villain and evil, but from what you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019re no different than any of the other leaders in power. You\u2019re just better at it.\n\nMaybe you should turn the world into a giant graveyard.\n\nEveryone thinks of you as a monster anyway, you see no reason to disappoint\u2026\n\n\u201cCatalina, I think it\u2019s time we finish this war once and for all.\u201d You say walking into her study.\n\u201cOh you do, do you? Well, I figured that it was coming eventually. So is there any specific way we\u2019re going about this?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we just make a massive push and don\u2019t stop until every living thing is dead.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Everything?\u201d\n\u201cEverything. I gave the world of the living the chance for peace and they don\u2019t seem to want it. Well I\u2019m tired of fighting, so if the only way to get some peace is to kill everything so be it!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean what happens if some people surrender? I mean you\u2019ll still allow them to live like you usually do right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s with this line of questioning Catalina? You\u2019ve never been one to wince at grand scale carnage.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I know, but I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright, out with it.\u201d\n\u201cWell I mean after we destroy the Grand Alliance, what then? There will be nothing else to do. I mean do we just reign over a land of the dead until the end of time?\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, is that our only option?\u201d\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake Cat, what the hell did you become a necromancer for then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause much like you I probably didn\u2019t feel like I had much in common with people and I could feel a pull towards the dark art of necromancy.\u201d\n\u201cWell what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026there isn\u2019t a problem\u2026it\u2019s just I feel like the end is coming soon and question what I\u2019ve accomplished in my life. I mean other than genocide what have I done?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Queen of the Dead! What more could you want?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, queen. Big whoop. I\u2019m basically a glorified concubine for a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn it Catalina I\u2019ve NEVER thought of you as that! You know I cherish you and all of you have to offer. I never could\u2019ve gotten this far without you.\u201d you say holding on to her and looking into her eyes.\n\n\u201c\u2026I know\u2026it\u2019s just in some ways I see you starting to change and I don\u2019t mean your general loathing of the living either. I mean you\u2019ve always been powerful, more powerful than me, but it\u2019s different. It\u2019s like you\u2019re becoming something else. I sometimes think your path is going to differ from mine to a degree that we will no longer be able to be together.\u201d\n\nFor a moment you forget about your problems and address Catalina.\n\n\u201cCatalina my beautiful queen\u2026no matter what happens I shall never leave you.\u201d you say and kiss her.\n\u201cAnd I shall never leave you\u2026Okay, where are we going to attack?\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019ve temporarily reassured Catalina\u2019s feelings, you do wonder if she isn\u2019t right. Will there come a day when you and her will have so many differences that you won\u2019t be able to be together anymore?\n\nYou wonder if you\u2019ve been taking some things for granted. You have everything you could ever need or want. Maybe you don\u2019t need to go on the attack. The Grand Alliance surely does not have the strength to defeat you; you doubt it would even attempt to expend all its resources in trying.\n\nSure you might have to continue to fight them, but when you think about it, would it be less tedious than an existence without any conflict?", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue with your attack", "result": "You can better appreciate what you have when all those that would do you harm are gone.\n\nYou order an attack of the largest size. While you\u2019re attacking from several directions, you decide to focus specifically on the Zalan Empire given that they\u2019re glue holding the Grand Alliance together. Get rid of them and you\u2019ve effective put an end to the war.\n\nCorpses, skeletons, ghosts, wraiths, and all other manner of undead are raised to your grand plan. Town after town is taken. The Grand Alliance nor the Zalan Military can do anything to stop you. They use magic, they use new technological wonders, but none of it works. It is only when your dead legions approach the gates of the Zalan capital that you call a stop to the carnage.\n\nYou arrive personally to oversee your mission and to meet with your family one last time, because even after all this, you don\u2019t want to kill them. Somewhere you hope that they\u2019ll see reason and come with you. Things won\u2019t be so bad.\n\nYou storm the gates as cannons destroy multitudes of your troops only to be replaced with more. You see your sister on top of the battlements ordering her soldiers to fire upon you. During this attack you feel several bullets enter your body breaking through your magical defenses.\n\nYou fall.\nYou then rise again.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, I\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 Great Lich Lord!\u201d you laugh.\n\nNot stopping, you enter the gates of the city realizing that this was inevitable. Things could\u2019ve only been this way. Your undead slay all those that oppose you, but you mentally make sure none of your undead has murderous intentions towards any of your family. You head towards your parent\u2019s old house, taking little notice of the death around you.\n\nWhen you arrive you find the house empty. In fact it looks like it\u2019s been empty for months. So many memories here\u2026a different time\u2026 even a different life now\u2026\n\n\u201cShe left when the attacks first came. She didn\u2019t say where either. She just told me she was leaving. I even had her followed for awhile, but she was quite adept at eluding my scouts, not to mention I had other concerns to take care of.\u201d Your sister says entering behind you.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, I would\u2019ve made sure no harm came to her. That\u2019s why I came here.\u201d\n\u201cYou already harmed her by becoming what you are! I mean\u2026you\u2019re not even alive anymore! I saw you die and come back to life on the battlefield!\u201d\n\u201cOh that. The first time was a surprise to me too. Kind of a numb feeling really.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be so at peace with what you\u2019ve become?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was obviously in my nature all along. Death is my calling, I\u2019ve only grown closer to it by dying. Can\u2019t change who I am.\u201d\n\u201cDad did.\u201d\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. Not really. He just directed his nature into a slightly more positive way and it was only due to magic that caused it in the first place. Funny how magic did the same with me, but just in reverse. However, as I\u2019ve said, this does not mean I\u2019m not without total feelings. I\u2019d rather not have to kill you sis, but if you stand against me, I will.\u201d\n\u201cI have to stand against you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? For some noble cause of a corrupt mortal empire that\u2019s just as oppressive? Sis you always were a bit too duty bound.\u201d\n\u201cNo, because while you still exist, life ALL life is in danger. You\u2019re evil, what you\u2019ve been doing is evil, what you\u2019ve become is unnatural. You can delude yourself all you want, but I\u2019m not fooled and if I joined you or whatever it is you want, then I\u2019d be just as guilty of contributing to your evil. You\u2019re not even my brother anymore, I have no brother!\u201d\n\nYou shake your head in regret at your sister\u2019s insistence on being stubborn, but then again you expected no less.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance sis.

She then pulls the sword out of your body.\n\n\u201cBetter do it now sis. I don\u2019t think I can hold back my nature forever.\u201d\n\nWith those words, your sister cleaves your head from your shoulders.\n\nOnce again the world has been saved from the brink of death.\n\nIn time things get better, though never back to the way they truly were. Catalina committed suicide soon after she found out about your death, but other necromancers quickly attempted to fill the power vacuum. They of course were never able to approach your power, but a few established a permanent dominion of death in the Drozz region. The area to this day is avoided.\n\nYour sister became celebrated as a Hero and eventually took the Zalan crown leading the Empire in a nobler direction. Your Mom came back from where ever it is she disappeared to and together with your sister, mourned your death in private.\n\nFor in reality it was you who stopped death from taking over the world, proving that even death can show mercy.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Defend yourself", "result": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You say calmly and blast your sister with powerful beam of negative energy causing the color to drain from her face and turn her hair completely white. She\u2019s still continues towards you, but another blast causes her to fall. She looks up at you with tears in her eyes and to your surprise she attempts to reach out to you. You crouch down and take her hand which she grips on to tightly.\n\n\u201c\u2026don\u2019t\u2026turn me into\u2026one of those things\u2026please\u2026don\u2019t\u201d she wheezes.\n\u201cNever. You shall die as you lived. With honor. Your body will be burned.\u201d\n\nThis statement seems to reassure her and she closes her eyes and lets go of life.\n\nYou really wished you hadn\u2019t had to do that.\n\n\u201cBe at peace at last dear sister. May whatever afterlife you go to be better than this one.\u201d\n\nYou cast a small fire ball at your sister\u2019s body and leave the house to burn, feeling yet another piece of your mortalhood die. One of your necromancers sees and comes up to you.\n\n\u201cLord, we\u2019ve pretty much taken the city. The Emperor and Empress of Zalan were killed in their own throne room. We\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You say dismissively.\n\u201cSo what do you want done with the city?\u201d\n\u201cBurn it all to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cBurn it? Don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI SAID BURN IT.\u201d You say not wishing to repeat yourself.\n\u201cUm Right! Okay you heard the Great Lich Lord! Burn it all to the ground!\u201d\n\nTen years pass\u2026\n\n\nTwenty years since you embarked on your path of necromancy. The end of all life looms ever closer.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Zalan Empire, the remnants of the Grand Alliance fell apart. One by one the remaining kingdoms and other governments fell before your armies. It was almost pathetically easy. The civilized world as it was known is no more. Only the dead exist.\n\nYou even had those subjects that once pledged their allegiance to you while still alive killed. You can barely tolerate your own necromancers. Catalina is the only one you still care about anymore. She\u2019s still supportive, but nervous around you. You wish she wasn\u2019t though.\n\nSome races such as elves, sprites and other fairy type folk retreated to their woods and forests, relying on illusions, tricks and other ways to conceal themselves. Other races like dwarves, gnomes and subterranean types dug deeper into the earth hoping that you will forget about them. Yet others like humans, orcs and the like still insist on fighting you from their makeshift camps, using hit and run tactics when they can.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what any of them do however, you won\u2019t rest until all life has been extinguished, if it takes you centuries, so be it. You\u2019ll hunt them all, you\u2019ll find them all, you\u2019ll kill them all.\n\nLately, though there have been odd occurrences. You have sensed disturbances in the very landscape from time to time. In your new undead state you of course never sleep anymore, but you\u2019ve been having visions. Flashbacks. And they seem all too real sometimes.\n\nAfter months of research you\u2019ve tracked down one of these disturbances to the old Vampire Clan fortress. You make haste to find out if any of those accursed bloodsuckers still live. You don\u2019t see how though as you were thorough in their destruction.\n\nThis time you don\u2019t even bother telling Catalina what you think you should do next, you know exactly what you\u2019re going to do. You just walk in her study and tell her you\u2019re leaving for a little while and to keep an eye on things as usual. You teleport yourself to the location of their now desiccated fortress. Partially burned and falling into disrepair from your actions fifteen years ago.\n\nYou throw open the massive doors with ease.\n\n\u201cLittle blood leeches, if any of you still remain, your best idea would\u2019ve been to hide and stay that way.\u201d Your voice echoes throughout the halls.\n\u201cNo, Great Lich Lord they are all dead. You made sure of that. You always do. It\u2019s just you and me.\u201d you hear a voice shout back. The voice sounds somewhat familiar, but you immediately home in on it since whoever felt the need to talk shit is obviously the one behind all this.\n\nAfter walking a bit, you enter the throne room where you still see a few traces of dust from the vampires you slaughtered long ago. You hear a maniacal laugh and a man materialize a few feet in front of you. This man looks much different now; his clothing is ragged and filthy. He has a manic grin and giggles a bit while constantly looking around, but you still recognize him and you have to say you\u2019re genuinely surprised to see him. He\u2019s very much alive too.\n\n\u201cTrelik\u2026thought you were long dust by now.\u201d\n\u201cNearly was, quite a few times, but after my shameful defeat in the Brot Kingdom I decided to lay low. For when that day came, I knew then I would never be able to defeat you or anyone else. So I waited and watched you gain power. Watched you destroy your enemies. Watched you have everything that I wanted since the days of the Dark Order. Remember those days? Seems like so long ago no?\u201d\n\u201cAnother life time.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed\u2026I\u2019ve learned that time can be a very bizarre thing\u2026who knows what might\u2019ve happened had events occurred slightly differently due to a split second?\u201d\n\u201cIs there any point to your insane ramblings Trelik?\u201d\n\u201cNot really\u2026but perhaps! We shall see\u2026or rather we have seen\u2026all has been seen\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like where this is going\u2026\n\n\u201cWhile I might not be able to kill you, I can do something else! Here\u2019s another blast from the past!\u201d\n\nSuddenly Trelik disappears and you feel yourself going in slow motion\u2026\n\nOh fuck.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! Ol\u2019 Quayle\u2019s books sure come in handy, but man do they make you see some crazy shit! I think I\u2019ve gone completely bat shit insane at this point, but who cares? We\u2019re all dead men! Fuck killing the world! Let\u2019s kill reality!\u201d\n\nTrelik isn\u2019t kidding either; the very fabric is warping to a degree you didn\u2019t even see when you were dealing with Quayle.\n\nYou suddenly find yourself in the middle of a battle. You notice you\u2019re living again. It\u2019s\nbeen so long you almost forgot what\u2019s like to breathe. You take a brief look around and you\u2019re in Aftermath\u2026or Nuro rather.\n\nA demonologist looking very worn from battle sees you and you have to stop yourself from attacking\n\n\u201cHey hold on! I\u2019m on your side! Shit, this didn\u2019t turn out as planned, did it?\u201d\n\u201cOh I dunno, I think it turned out EXACTLY as planned.\u201d You say getting the very real sense that you\u2019ve done this before. The demonologist ignores your strange talk and continues.\n\n\u201cMr. Demar is still battling the rest of the staff in the college and I\u2019m really worried about what the hell\u2019s going on with Quayle\u2019s spell, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve experienced it yet, but I\u2019ve been seeing buildings phase in and out of existence. I knew fucking around with time would be trouble!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it is. I guess I better go handle this. I hope I remember what I did last time.\u201d You say and make your way to see Quayle\u2026 again.\n\nWhen you get to the east campus, you see Catalinia right on time. Looking at her at this age again makes you remember when you desired her mainly for her body rather than all of her other exquisite attributes.\n\n\u201cNice to see you again. Quayle\u2019s in the gray building right?\u201d You say.\n\u201cUm, yeah. I think he\u2019s in there, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know it\u2019s dangerous, but someone\u2019s gotta go in, so I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ve risked too much already to fail. I suggest you go help Mr. Demar.\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWow, this whole thing has really made you really authoritative. You\u2019ve come a long way since Enchantment class.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve heard that somewhere else before.\u201d\n\nThis time you dispense with your attempts to kiss Catalina. There will be plenty of time for that in the future.\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see, if I remember this\u2026\u201d you say as you make your way to the gray building avoiding the time disturbances.\n\nWhen you enter the building you see Quayle again. Same position. Same glow of white light.\n\n\u201cYou are the future\u2026there is no future\u2026there are many futures\u2026it\u2019s all so fascinating\u2026\u201d he says once again in an echoed voice.\n\u201cHey Quayle, you know we\u2019ve done this before right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes\u2026yes we have\u2026we will continue to do so\u2026such is time\u2026it is inevitable\u2026\u201d\n\nAny second now the weird tentacle creatures are going to start popping out and you don\u2019t feel like dealing with them again. You didn\u2019t want to do it the first time.\n\nIn fact this whole event is making your mind feel weird again, you feel like you\u2019re losing something just by being here.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run and tackle Quayle", "result": "You remember what you did last time and it was successful, so you confidently try again.\n\nYou run towards Quayle narrowly dodging a tentacle creature along the way\u2026\n\nQuayle once again splatters into a gooey insect mess.\n\nSomething changes though. You\u2019re no longer aware of the fact that you\u2019re in the past. In fact your memories only lead up to this particular moment and right now all you\u2019re concerned about it is getting these centipedes off of you.\n\nAnd so it goes, you live out the same exact \u201clife\u201d as you did before. Taking over Aftermath, destroy Brot with undead giants, killing Velzix\u2026all of it.\n\nEventually you meet Trelik again, and the same things happens. And again. And again. And again. You don\u2019t realize it at all.\n\nTrelik has trapped you in a time loop that you have no knowledge of anymore. And that is where you will stay.\n\nUntil the end of time\u2026", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Try something else", "result": "This isn\u2019t \u201cyour time\u201d and something is very different. You can sense it. Something is here that wasn\u2019t before.\n\nYou quickly scan the room again and from the far left side of the room you hear a little giggle.\n\nOne of tentacle creatures appear once again and you fight back the nausea long enough to cast a blast of negative energy towards the sounds of the laughter.\n\nTrelik materializes from your lucky direct hit and howls in pain before collapsing on the floor. His high pitched screech seems to irk the creature and it grabs him with one of the tentacles.\n\n\n\n\u201cNO! NO! HAHAHAHA! I WAS GOING TO CONTROL TIME!\u201d Trelik laughs before they turn into screams when the creature proceeds to devour him.\n\nTrelik might\u2019ve been dealt with, but you still have to preserve the time line! You immediately rush to tackle Quayle and narrowly dodge another tentacle beast that appears near you.\n\nYou are just about to reach Quayle\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026once again\u2026the future\u2026the past\u2026unite\u2026\u201d you hear Quayle just as you\u2019re about to collide with him.\n\nExcept instead of colliding with him you collide into the stone floor of the vampire fortress! Or at least you thought it was\u2026\n\nYou stand up and find yourself in the middle of a castle, but it\u2019s different. You see dead elves and humans lying on the floor. Looks like they were fighting each other. You attempt to raise them, but nothing happens. Your powers aren\u2019t working at all and in this living flesh cage you\u2019ve been once again cursed with, you feel pretty vulnerable.\n\nYou hear human soldiers laughing and running and you hide.\n\n\u201cHar har! This was a good idea. Elves can\u2019t fight worth shit! Where\u2019s the captain anyway?\u201d\n\u201cOh you know him; he\u2019s probably finding something of more value to keep to himself.\u201d\n\nAfter they pass by you proceed to make your way through the ruins of this castle which is obviously under siege. You think you\u2019re nearing the exit when all of a sudden you hear the sounds of battle and a very familiar voice\u2026\n\n\u201cYou better save your own ass elf, I mean to have whatever is behind that door and the likes of you aren\u2019t going to stop me!\u201d your Dad remarks.\n\u201cNever! I have sworn to protect the treasure behind here with my life!\u201d the Elven guard exclaims.\n\nYou see your Dad and this elven guard clash swords. You watch from the shadows and it\u2019s obvious that this elf is slightly more skilled than your Dad. You might not have your powers, but you realize what has happened. You\u2019ve been transported to the past again. This is the elven castle that your Dad laid siege to. He\u2019s supposed to meet your Mom here. She\u2019s probably the \u201ctreasure\u201d that the elven guard is protecting.\n\nAnother familiar voice calls out to you in your mind with a sorrow filled tone.\n\n\u201cYou wish to end all life because you loathe it so? Or is it that you loathe your own life? I have seen you set out on this path and while regrettable I see that it was inevitable. Perhaps I am to blame. I give you a chance to make things right and allow life to bloom once again instead of an existence of ultimate isolation and loneliness.\u201d\n\nThat voice sounded very much like your Mom. But you haven\u2019t discovered any trace of her despite your searches. Then again that might make sense if she\u2019s gone into this time slipping business.\n\n\u201cMom\u2026do you defy me as well? Have you and Trelik formed some unholy alliance?\u201d you whisper under your breath to her while attempting to contain your anger and wounded feelings. Feelings you haven\u2019t really had in a long time.\n\u201cNo, my son. Trelik\u2019s mad plan was his own. I have merely taken advantage of his poor judgment in attempting to alter time. Yes son, you are not the only one in the family who has the knowledge of forbidden magic and a master of it. I give you a choice\u2026life or death. Think carefully about making your decision. Think about your possible future. Think about what you\u2019ve become. Think about what you\u2019ve done. Your existence has caused the end of the world\u2019s own. Is that really what you want?\u201d\n\nThis question has been posed to you many times before in the past. Every time you\u2019ve dismissed it because it\u2019s been so far off before. But as the end grows ever closer, you\u2019ll have to come to very real possibility that immortality on a dead world may very well grow dreary. This latest time trip has been the most excitement you\u2019ve had in years\u2026\n\nYou look over at your Dad, who is losing his battle with the elven guard.\n\nMaybe it would be better had you never been born\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Help your Dad", "result": "Destiny can be changed, but you\u2019re not changing yours. You were meant to do this. You\u2019ll see this out to the very end.\n\nSince you don\u2019t have any of your powers, you pick up a hefty nearby vase and hurl it at the elven guard from the shadows. Your aim is pitiful as the vase completely misses him and instead flies over his head and hits the wall.\n\nHowever, the elven guard glances briefly in the direction to which the vase was thrown long enough for your Dad to take the advantage. He skewers the elf and smashes him in the face with his armored gauntlet.\n\n\u201cHa ha! Stupid fucking elf! Shoulda been paying attention to the fight!\u201d he laughs and gives the guard one last kick to the head before opening up the treasure door\u2026\n\nYou slink away. Your birth has now been assured and you suddenly are transported back to your proper time period and back in the ex-vampire fortress. Once again you are undead, however, you find that you have a letter in your hand which is addressed to you\n\nSon,\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this then you have chosen death, as was predicted. I do not blame you for embracing your destiny. The pull of dark magic has always been strong in the bloodline. Elves typically can control such urges, however as you know you are not full elven, but still I did not think this possible of you though. You were so unskilled in the ways of magic that the chances of you becoming a competent necromancer seemed so unlikely, let alone an emissary of death. I will not stand in you way for I cannot bring myself to destroy you, even though I could. This is why I gave you the choice to destroy yourself. Do not look for me as I have long left this world and time, a simpler time, long even before the rise of the first Great Lich Lord. Indeed, I am already long dead by the time you have read this. My final gift to you my son, one less death you need concern yourself about. I only hope that you can find peace in your path for eventually you will be alone.\n\nLove Mom.\n\nYou crumple the letter.\n\n\u201cThanks Mom.\u201d You say and return to Aftermath as you have shed one more link to your mortal life.\n\nThirty years pass\u2026\n\nFifty years have passed. Peace reigns. There is no more conflict. All serious resistance has been eliminated. There will be no heroes to save the world. Death has won.\n\nYour powers have grown to the extent that your mere presence is slowly killing the world. You tested out this theory when you spent some time in one of the last elven defended forests. The trees began to rot and wither within a day. Reports talk of even the creatures in the oceans dying and you haven\u2019t even been anywhere near there. Anything still alive will die soon; it\u2019s only a matter of time. Your poison is enveloping the skies, the waters and the ground far beneath the earth.\n\nYou truly have become death personified.\n\nYour necromancers have all died and you didn\u2019t allow them to try to become liches either. A small coup was attempted, but it was easily put down. You\u2019re controlling it all.\n\nThe one last link to your mortal \u201clife\u201d remains. Catalina. She lies on her bed dying. It is only due to her own powers that she\u2019s been able to survive your presence this long, but she can\u2019t do it any longer. You\u2019re too powerful.\n\nYou sit by her bed to talk to her one last time. You stroke her hair and hold her hand relishing the warmth that it still gives off even in this near death state.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stay with you.\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou could. You have the power to become a lich.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026no\u2026I don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s not my desire or path. I once said I thought the differences between us would be too great for us to stay together.\u201d\n\u201cI remember. And you were right. You usually are.\u201d\n\u201cWe had a good run though didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes we did.\u201d You agree.\n\u201cAre you going to be alright? I mean what are you going to do?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cMe? I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll stick around and oversee things I guess. Watch the world die. I have to carry this out to end.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do\u2026maybe we\u2019ll meet again? On the other side?\u201d she smiles weakly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if it\u2019s possible. We will.\u201d\n\u201cI love you\u2026\u201d\n\nYou then kiss her one last time as life finally fades from her body.\n\n\u201cMy love from this world is now gone, what little was left has followed you to the other side my beloved queen.

He falls cursing and swearing, before the elven guard finishes him off with a thrust to his neck.\n\n\u201cHeh, that\u2019s what should\u2019ve happened in the first place.\u201d You say and quietly slink off.\n\nYou walk into an empty room and wonder what will happen next. You\u2019ve just destroyed your existence. Though you\u2019re still here, so you\u2019re not sure what that means. Are you going to disappear soon, or will you just continue your existence until you reach your \u201cproper time?\u201d\n\nYou hear your Mom\u2019s voice again, one last time.\n\n\u201cYou have chosen life as was predicted. Your time as you know it is no more\u2026time\u2026time defeats all. Time even defeats death\u2026however time is not without mercy and your existence in history is not gone, just altered. \u2026the future\u2026the past\u2026does it matter?

You have no idea where you\u2019re at, let alone how you got there. In fact you don\u2019t have too much memory of anything. All you\u2019re sure of is that you have a great knowledge of magic and that you\u2019re not truly alive.\n\nSuddenly a ragged bunch of individuals approach, you prepare to defend yourself, but these half crazed tribals are in awe of you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him! He is the one we called upon! Our prayers have been answered! We have sacrificed our remaining livestock to appease you! Please our village has suffered a great loss.

You\u2019ve won. You don\u2019t need to commit worldwide slaughter. In fact at this point you\u2019d rather just give it all up in exchange for peace and quiet with Catalina.

I\u2019m getting bored with it, there\u2019s not really a challenge anymore, so what\u2019s the point? Let\u2019s just leave.\u201d\n\u201cWell where are we going to do that?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to that hidden Vampire Clan fortress. Nobody else is using it and all it needs is a little fixing up. I can easily set up the magic to hide it again.\u201d\n\u201cEasily eh? Boy you have come a long way. I remember when you cast that spell in enchantment class and caused all those frogs to attack the professor.\u201d\n\u201cBoy you\u2019re never going to let me forget that are you? I still think those were a species of killer frogs and they would\u2019ve attacked anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Those were pygmy Eraw frogs! They\u2019re one of the most benign creatures on the planet! YOU turned them into killers!\u201d Catalina laughs.\n\u201cYeah, well he deserved it anyway. He was going to fail me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t after that, though he probably was a little afraid of you. Guess you always had it in you even back then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026well you ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cWait we\u2019re just leaving? Shouldn\u2019t we make arrangements or something first?\u201d\n\u201cLike I said fuck it, let all these necromancers fight over it. If one of them thinks they can try to take my place then let \u2018em. I predict it\u2019ll all fall apart within a year though. They can\u2019t be me.\u201d\n\u201cNo they can\u2019t. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou and Catalina then press the key to the old vampire fortress. Fortunately it doesn\u2019t need too much fixing up and you have it restored in no time. It is from here where you and Catalina stay to watch the world events unfold in fascination.\n\nJust as you predicted your dominion of the dead collapsed due to infighting. To your surprise Trelik popped up again and amusingly he even claimed he\u2019d destroyed you and Catalina. Even more amusingly he was one of the first usurpers to die during the civil war.\n\nThe Grand Alliance took advantage of the situation and eventually broke the stranglehold that the dead once held over the living. Your sister stormed the gates of Aftermath itself and reclaimed it. She became a hero of epic proportions. You\u2019re glad. You\u2019re glad you made this decision. You didn\u2019t want to have to kill her or your Mom.\n\nThe world didn\u2019t immediately go back to normal though. Your actions have had repercussions and there yet still remains areas of the world where necromancers rule, possibly the undead will always have a strong influence in some areas, but the threat of the end of all life is no longer a possibility.

She will stick with you, if only because together you\u2019ll be a more formidable force when trouble surely arises.\n\nYou and Catalina prepare yourselves for the trouble ahead\u2026\n\nA month passes\nThe Incident of Nuro has finally become well known knowledge. You and Catalina have managed to shore up the defenses of Nuro pretty well, all things considered. Some of the demonologists help out, but only because they have nowhere else to go and this is the safest place for them. You begin to instruct them to learn the ways of necromancy. You also manage to turn back a Grand Alliance army which didn\u2019t expect such a large resistance. The demons that left the city ran amok all over the countryside and took a particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan under the guidance of Velzix, an arch fiend. Which is fortunate since it draws a little attention away from you.\n\nNo signs of that \u201ctemporal hole\u201d opening up again, but you tell some of your new acolytes to keep an eye on it. In the mean time nothing of importance is to be placed in that area.\n\nA year passes\nThe Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area, which doesn\u2019t bode well for you since now you\u2019re the only \u201cbig evil\u201d around now.\n\nThe Grand Alliance attempts another siege of the city and once again they fail. You aren\u2019t confident you can hold out forever like this though, you attempt to claim that you have no plans for conquest, but your claims (true or not) go unheeded. They aren\u2019t taking any chances that you might build up.\n\nYou and Catalina have at this point basically become \u201cKing and Queen\u201d of the city. It\u2019s a logical pairing. Sometimes though it\u2019s more than just one of convenience.\n\nYour acolytes warn you about seeing strange things. Object temporarily disappearing. You begin to worry and unlock those old tomes that Quayle was reading hoping you can learn something.\n\nAnother years passes\nYou suffer two more attacks by the Grand Alliance. The last one lead by your own sister. You attempted to parley with her before battle, but she would have none of it. Indeed you\nreceived a letter from your Mom a month before the attack begging you to give yourself up. Of course you couldn\u2019t do that. You wrote her back with regret and told her that you shall probably not speak again.\n\nYour sister got farther than most, but in the end she died by your own hand. You didn\u2019t raise her. She was not deserving of such a fate. You burned her body instead and wished her well in the afterlife.\n\nHow you wished that your Dad\u2019s mercenary company had been sent, but for whatever reason you have not heard anything from him. The coward. He knows you are more powerful and could easily crush him.\n\nThe temporal disturbances are getting worse, and you\u2019re not learning anything new from Quayle\u2019s books, it\u2019s all just so damn confusing. You feel like you did when you were in school. Completely inept and helpless.\n\nCatalina tries to be understanding, but your behavior from reading the damn books is making you very erratic. She has to pick up the slack when you begin to make mistakes.\n\nAnother year passes\n\n\nThe temporal hole rips open once again. Horrible creatures come lurching out. You manage to fight them off, but the hole is getting bigger. Catalina insists that you both have to leave the city, but you\u2019re too far gone at this point, the books on temporal magic have begun to make you as mad as they did Quayle. (If without the talent) This is your city and you\u2019re bound and determined to hold it no matter what.\n\nShe cannot endure anymore; she takes her leave of you one night\u2026only to be killed by vampire assassins somewhere in the countryside.\n\nThe Grand Alliance is preparing to attack again, more tentacle creatures are seeping into this reality. You don\u2019t care; you\u2019ll take them all on.\n\nYou laugh insanely on your throne as the screams and unnatural howls fill the city. Battle and death is everywhere. You hear something coming up the stairs, and it\u2019s probably not Grand Alliance soldiers\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat was the point of it all?

A few demonologists attempted to run the hollow shell of the city, but severely lacked any sort of manpower, natural or unnatural to hold it. They were easily defeated when the Grand Alliance army came to retake the city. The demons that left the city ran amok all over the countryside and took a particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan under the guidance of Velzix, an arch fiend.\n\nYou and Catalina still remain unknown as far as being involved, but other members of the Dark Order that escaped are starting to be hunted down\u2026\n\nA year passes\nThe Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. Most of the demonologist have been caught and hung for their crimes as well. Your name has also come up on the wanted list along with Catalina\u2019s.\n\nYou both now keep to the rural locations; many times you have to fend off attacks from barbaric orc tribes. Fortunately your skills in necromancy protect you (as well as scare the hell out of the orcs)\n\nDespite the hardship (Or perhaps because of it) you and Catalina form a sort of relationship beyond one of just mutual protection. There are times when you forget that you\u2019re being hunted constantly.\n\nTwo years pass\nJust like Mr. Demar predicted a temporal disturbance in the city of Nuro reappears again. Horrible creatures come lurching out creating a \u201cSecond Incident\u201d before the time hole is repaired for good. However the city is evacuated due to mass insanity caused there and is considered a danger zone under observation by the Grand Alliance.\n\nCatalina is killed by vampire assassins during the night, you take vengeance, but it\u2019s too late for her. You weep for the first time in a long time. You briefly flirt with the idea of raising her\u2026but you burn her body instead and carry on your path alone.\n\nAnd all you can think about is how tired you are\u2026\n\nTwo more years pass\nYou hear them coming for you, there is no more running.

You have no idea, but you can\u2019t be seen walking around the countryside with a bunch of rotting corpses in tow.\n\nQuickly you dismiss your small army, which instantly collapses back to death and you run to the nearest settlement.\n\nYou get to the town of Selawag, which is part of the Brot Kingdom. You enter an inn there with no problems. It would appear that the news of what\u2019s happened hasn\u2019t traveled here yet, but you know it won\u2019t be long. And then how long will it be before someone finds out that you were involved? You suppose it\u2019s possible that you could escape without suspicion, but it\u2019s unlikely.

A temporal disturbance in the heart of the city has made the entire area unstable as buildings phase in and out of existence. Two of the well known culprits Mr. Demar and Felsa were killed in battle. A third, Trelik escaped and is considered to be at large. Many of the Dark Order were either killed or went into hiding. Demons are running amok all over the countryside and have taken particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan.\n\nA year passes\nThe Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. Necromancer Trelik was finally hunted down and killed after he was cornered in a small village that he\u2019d turned into his own personal domain.

Big Red typically hangs around in the seedy parts of Nuro, but he also hangs around the park area on campus late at night. His presence in Nuro is barely tolerated, but he\u2019s been known to acquire things for high ranking officials and provide important information that is beneficial to Nuro security.\n\nOddly for all his mercenary criminal behavior he\u2019s tight lipped for a demon and will only tell on someone if asked directly and only then for the right price.

Since you\u2019re obviously new and not hip to how this works, I\u2019m inclined to believe you\u2019re not working for someone. Someone undercover wouldn\u2019t be so obviously clueless as you seem to be, at least not to catch the likes of me.

Excuse me?\u201d you stutter at Big Red\u2019s odd scenario outcome.\n\u201cThis is serious shit, if word got around that I was selling information on the Dark Arts, let alone books on it, my ass would be strung up and killed. And to have some dumb ass college student fucking around with something as dangerous as that is asking for trouble since YOU\u2019RE probably going to get yourself caught, which will then lead to possible questions before they kill you\u2026which can then link to me. And that can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get caught.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Heard that one before from people getting busted for less. I dunno, I don\u2019t see you as a good risk and even if I did consider this request my price would be VERY high and I don\u2019t see you as having that kind of money to spend.\u201d\n\nBig Red\u2019s denials of your request are actually making you want what he has even more. You KNOW he can help you. In fact you\u2019re beginning to get irritated. Why the hell is he denying you this? He\u2019s a fucking demon who sells illegal shit! He shouldn\u2019t care at all! You\u2019re desperate for his help though so you tell an outlandish lie.\n\n\u201cLook my parents are rich! I can get the money for you, just gimme your price and I can get it\u2026it might take me awhile, but I can get it.\u201d\n\u201cOh you can huh? Alright then I\u2019ll play your game. He\u2019s my price.\u201d Big Red pulls out a little pad of paper and pencil and writes something on it and then hands it to you. You read the astronomical price while Big Red\u2019s face turns into a smug demonic grin. He probably did that for dramatic effect.\n\nThere\u2019s no way you can pay this, even if you somehow managed to convince your parents to give you money to support your grossly illegal studies in necromancy. You\u2019re not going to let it stop you though.\n\n\u201cWow\u2026that is high\u2026okay. I can get this, but it\u2019ll take me a few days.\u201d You say feigning a mixture of shock, but calmness too. Big Red himself looks surprised that you agreed. He begins to write down something on his pad again and gives it to you.\n\n\u201cWell alright money bags, we got a deal. You come meet me at this time and location in a week. If you ain\u2019t there, then you can forget about coming to see me for anything ever again. If you come and you don\u2019t have the money\u2026well I don\u2019t think I need to stress how bad that would be. So my advice is if you don\u2019t have it, don\u2019t show. See ya.\u201d\n\u201cHey wait, you said you can fix my grade too.\u201d You suddenly remember.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve spent enough money tonight? Alright then maybe you ARE made of gold after all, so what\u2019s the class?\u201d\n\u201cNature magic.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, you said that. Yeah, that\u2019s definitely doable, mainly because the professor is, I just need to slip the deviled ham into her and she\u2019ll be willing to pass anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI thought she was a lesbian.\u201d\n\u201cFeh, not when it comes to Big Red. It ain\u2019t just a name ya know. Alright, my price for this task is two hundred gold pieces. Normally I might charge less, but hey you got the money right?\u201d\n\nIndeed, but you don\u2019t have much now after forking it over to Big Red. You were hoping the gold you brought was going to go towards a necromantic tome, but instead it\u2019s just going to cheating.\n\n\u201cThanks, and as appreciation for your generous business tonight, I think I\u2019ll go take care of that grade situation of yours right now, if I\u2019m lucky maybe she\u2019ll have one of those little elven bitches with her. Ha ha!\u201d\n\nAs Big Red leaves you, you head back to your apartment to scheme for the rest of the week. You go through a wide variety of emotions: fear, anger, desire, anxiety, obsession, etc. None of it really means anything though since you don\u2019t really have too much in the way of choices now.

Whoever wanted him dead, made sure of it.\n\nOf course this doesn\u2019t exactly help you get what you wanted to get from him. Not knowing what else to do, you begin to search the house, but you\u2019re not finding too much, but for some reason you sense you aren\u2019t completely alone in this house.

Mr. Demar continues for you though.\n\n\u201cAnd tell me, if I was head of such an organization, you say I would want you? How is it that you are skilled in the ways of necromancy? How have you managed to train? Do you have access to the dead and possession of necromantic texts? How did you come across such things?\u201d\n\u201cWell uh\u2026I don\u2019t like to mention this\u2026but I have an ancestor who served under the Great Lich Lord and a couple of books of his have been in my family\u2019s possession for centuries.\u201d\n\u201cWell now, necromantic tomes from the era of the Great Lich Lord himself! I am impressed. And you say you had an ancestor who served under him eh?

You need defenders and ghosts are probably going to serve you better for as long as this slow spell lasts.\n\nOnce again you succeed and with your ghostly bodyguards you march outside a little more confident.\n\nYou find that the city is one big killing zone. Demons are really running amok through the streets, a few of them attack you, but your ghost protect you. It would appear that they don\u2019t see you as an ally.\n\nSensing the need for even more protection, you raise some of the many dead bodies that now litter the streets. A few of Nuro\u2019s mage guards attempt to stop you, but you easily defeat them and add them to your ranks. It\u2019s so easy for you.

You\u2019re not in the Dark Order!\u201d a voice calls out to you, and you turn around to see another necromancer. He\u2019s rather non-descript looking and isn\u2019t controlling nearly as many dead as you are. No ghosts either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m what you call\u2026independent I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOh is that right eh?

They stop in their tracks, and then they turn around in his direction.\n\n\u201cHey! Stop that! You can\u2019t do that! You\u2019re supposed to listen to me!\u201d he shouts totally losing his cool, not to mention his control.\n\nInstead of trying to regain it, he attempts to blast you with a bolt of negative energy, but at this point you\u2019re well protected by meat shield of corpses, who seem to be moving faster\u2026\n\nThe slow spell!

I guess I was lucky not to have hooked up with such fools!\u201d you say to a nearby zombie who doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nYou march through the city truly exercising your power for the first time, soon you come across two more necromancers attempting to destroy city hall where the last bastion of resistance resides in the city.

You try to shake off the effects so you can keep control, but it doesn\u2019t matter as you begin to see your various undead troops go through weird changes. You watch them either accelerate in rot and disintegrate, or even stranger actually turn back into their living selves until they eventually become babies and then nothing.\n\nYou\u2019re only halfway to the building and you begin to worry that you\u2019re going to suffer the same fate, but manage to get in the Gray building which contains a simple auditorium like classroom. You must be back on campus. At the front of the class you see a strange man surrounded by a white glow.

You\u2019re having a hard time concentrating still though and once again you begin to feel very sick. That feeling becomes stronger when you see grotesque creatures pop into existence.

As much as you\u2019ve seen during your short time raising the dead, you\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\n\nYou can\u2019t hear anymore explosions; you wonder if Mr. Demar has won. You exit the building and begin to walk over to the other side of the campus where the explosions were coming from.\n\nYou arrive to burning buildings and ruins of towers. Once again you see Sebastian, he\u2019s sitting outside holding his head in his hands. He looks like he\u2019s sobbing.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over! It\u2019s all over!\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? It looks like the city is ours.\u201d\n\u201cBut for how long? All our so called demon allies took off! By the time I got here Mr. Demar had already been severely wounded and his second in command Trelik had betrayed him. Catalina and I managed to kill Trelik, but Catalina fell in the battle! The Dark Order is over and I dunno what\u2019s coming next, we\u2019re all in a lot of fucking trouble! Trouble that I wasn\u2019t prepared to handle! I\u2019m not really a leader. Mr. Demar was a leader! Oh man why did I choose this path!?\u201d\n\nSebastian is having a complete mental break down and it sickens you. It\u2019s unbecoming of a necromancer.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Demar?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead in the library!\u201d\n\u201cGood, saves me the trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m not going to tolerate whimpering weaklings like you.\u201d and you blast Sebastian with negative energy to his face, killing him.\n\nYep, you\u2019re in charge.\n\n\n\nA month passes\n\nThe \u201cNuro Incident\u201d as it came to be known was a shock to the civilized world. Nobody had anticipated such a thing occurring despite all preparations. Certainly not to Nuro given it\u2019s near \u201cinvincible\u201d reputation. You\u2019ve renamed the city Aftermath.\n\nThe Grand Alliance was immediately formed to retake the city, but fortunately for you, you weren\u2019t the only problem they had.\n\nVelzix, a demon lord who the Dark Order summoned to help them, soon left Nuro during its attack, and managed to unite the rest of the demons that felt the need to break their contract with the Dark Order. They turned their attention to the Tulan Kingdom. Right now he\u2019s established his own rule, enslaving the population and is most likely planning further conquest assuming he can keep his own troops from fighting each other long enough.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019ve already managed to hold off one Grand Alliance attack quite successfully due to your preparations. The first thing you did was command all the surviving Dark Order members to become necromancers. They\u2019re mediocre at best though, they might be better if you took a more direct hand in training them, but you\u2019re too impatient and you have so many other things to take care of as well.\n\nYou haven\u2019t heard anything from your family; you can only wonder what they think of all this and you don\u2019t really care.\n\nWhile things are somewhat quiet now, that\u2019s not going to last. The Grand Alliance will keep attacking and they may very well overwhelm you in time. You can\u2019t just sit in your throne room and prepare for the next attack and you need to be proactive about this threat, but the big problem though is, you\u2019re basically doing all of this yourself. There isn\u2019t anyone anywhere near your equal, let alone anyone you can trust to handle important things.\n\nAs much as you loathe thinking of it, you could ally with Velzix, granted he\u2019s an untrustworthy demon, and not fond of the Dark Order for imprisoning him, you were never a member of the Dark Order and may be receptive. You soon send messages to him asking for an alliance. Eventually you get a response, and it\u2019s a positive one. Velzix even says he\u2019ll meet you in the city of Aftermath. Apparently he isn\u2019t worried about you.\n\nWhen he arrives he gets right to business.\n\u201cNice decorations\u2026so, you wish to make a deal with me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to propose a pact between us yes. We have a common enemy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but what does this pact entail exactly?\u201d\n\u201cSimple, we don\u2019t attack one another and we coordinate our attacks to be more effective against the Grand Alliance.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I suppose while my attention isn\u2019t on you, and I waste my valuable resources, you build up strength and attack me eh? Heh heh, I know you little necromancer. I see the desire to murder the entire world in your eyes. I even respect it, but if you think I\u2019m trusting you, you\u2019re as brain dead as those corpses you raise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re a fucking demon and you\u2019re accusing ME of being deceitful?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Who better to see treachery than one who is an expert at it? But assuming you genuinely mean for us to be best buddies forever and ever, I still don\u2019t see what you can do for me in your current state.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you on about now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying as a military power you ain\u2019t shit that\u2019s what! Your necromancers are barely competent enough to hold your defenses of that little necropolis you rule. It\u2019s mostly you doing all the work, and while you\u2019ve got a little power, it still ain\u2019t enough to attack anything in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nYou hate the fact that Velzix is right, but you hate it even more that he\u2019s so damn smug about it. Which makes you wonder why he called you out here\u2026in fact you\u2019re starting to prepare yourself for trouble.\n\n\u201cAlright then what the hell are you proposing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI propose a\u2026merger rather than an alliance.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re proposing that I let YOU take over Aftermath and I just become your bitch.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly how I worded it, but if you prefer that designation\u2026\u201d\n\u201dNO! I don\u2019t prefer it!\u201d\n\u201cOkay then how about this? I say you\u2019ll last maybe another year tops if you stay walled up in this little city of yours just letting the Grand Alliance constantly beat down your gates until they finally succeed. Then assuming you don\u2019t die during that final attack, I predict that you live a ragged existence on the run for maybe a couple years afterwards at which point you\u2019ll end up getting hunted down and killed hiding in some cave somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you see?\u201d\n\u201cSeen it happen to more powerful mortals than you. BUT! It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Joining with me can be more beneficial than you think. You don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see the power in you? You would be a very valuable asset to my plans. Your ability to control the dead is very strong and quite frankly it would be nice to actually have not just troops that aren\u2019t fighting among themselves, but a great general as well. Think about it! You\u2019ll gain more power and you could still bring death to thousands and not have to worry about all the bullshit of ruling, because as I\u2019m sure you know, it isn\u2019t as fun as it should be most of the time. You will prosper, if you continue to prove yourself worthy and useful.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Join Velzix", "result": "Velzix\u2019s offer does have some appeal to it, you must admit, but having to answer to Velzix is repugnant to you. You feel that you were meant to rule, not follow. Perhaps you can build up a following though while serving under his rule, there\u2019s nothing saying you HAVE to be loyal\u2026\n\n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d\n\nVelzix smiles.\n\n\u201cHa ha! I knew you\u2019d see the smart thing to do little necromancer. I predict this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\u2026\u201d\n\nYou transfer your city over to Velzix, though the majority of your undead are still there, he just supplements its defenses with some of his own demons and the humans that have pledged their servitude to him.", "action_results": [{"action": "You are about to take your Necromantic career to its next level", "result": " \nChapter 3: One Foot in Hell\n\n\n\nOne year has passed\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been one year since you made an alliance with Velzix, and so far it has paid off. With your combined might, you both have successfully held off the Grand Alliance. You haven\u2019t gained too much ground, but that\u2019s looking like it\u2019s about to change.\n\nEveryday Velzix has somehow been managing to attract \u201cfree demons\u201d from other nations to join him, though its not as if they have too many other options as mere suspicion has turned into hatred and they are to be rounded up and killed as possible enemies. Though again, thanks to mortal failings and greed, there are those few nations that are still letting their small demonic populations run free. Not surprisingly Velzix has been attempting to convince the leaders of these governments into joining him in exchange for even greater power. Velzix has also been attempting to open portals to his own infernal realm on a permanent basis. Right now he can summon in a few reinforcements to replace battle losses, but nothing on a major scale.\n\nAs for you, things could be worse, but they could be better. All your potential \u201cacolytes\u201d reverted back to being demonologist when the merge came, though many of them were purged by Velzix himself, as he still remembered their attempts to imprison him before during their days in the Dark Order, not to mention if they were so quick to change allegiances so quickly, then they obviously weren\u2019t to be trusted.\n\nYour magic powers in other branches of magic have somewhat improved, though this might be due your infernal dealings. Necromancy is still your area of expertise obviously and as it stands, you\u2019re the only true necromancer allied with Velzix. You sort of hold a unique position, but you question its importance in the scheme of things. You\u2019ve been basically put on defense duty. Your undead troops are nothing more than meat shields for the most part, and while that is what they are there for, you\u2019d rather they be YOUR meat shields than some asshole demons, (or worse mortals). You feel like your talents are being wasted to a degree, like you\u2019ve got a lot of untapped potential that\u2019s dying to get out.\n\nHowever, open rebellion against Velzix isn\u2019t likely to happen, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from setting the stage. You still have Aftermath under your control, even if you do have to put up with the demons and mortals stationed there now. One night in your study while you\u2019re contemplating how to go about all this, you figure there are two ways.\n\nYou\u2019ve actually got a lot of troops at your immediate disposal. You believe you could probably take over the nearby Brot Kingdom by yourself without any help. They have a weak military and most of the Grand Alliance armies are busy elsewhere. You could build up a bigger power base. You might piss off Velzix by doing this by yourself, but you could take the chance that he might over look it if you\u2019re successful as it\u2019s also increasing his own territory.\n\nThe other option is to remain doing what you\u2019re doing and engage in a more secret assassination conspiracy against Velzix. You already know that tons of others are probably doing it, why not you? The problem is, individually most of you are fairly weak against him; though together you\u2019d be more successful. Of course getting a bunch of demonic assassinating liars to trust one another is probably even more difficult than the attempt itself.", "action_results": [{"action": "Engage in military conquest", "result": "What\u2019s the point of having power, if you aren\u2019t using it in any meaningful way that can\nhelp you? You\u2019re sick of being \u201creined in\u201d. You\u2019re going to do what you\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time.\n\nYou prepare to march an army of undead to the Brot Kingdom. The demons and mortals stationed at Aftermath are wondering what\u2019s going on though since most of them know you\u2019re mainly used for defense.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think yer goin\u2019?\u201d a demon solder steps up to ask you as you\u2019re about to leave the city gates.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go conquer the Brot Kingdom, got a problem with that?\u201d\n\u201cMe? No, not at all. Just didn\u2019t know Velzix let you off your leash.\u201d The demon soldier grins.\n\nThis remark is met with a negative energy blast to his face, completely ripping the flesh off and revealing the still grinning skull underneath. As the rest of this body falls to the ground, you feel the need to make a speech to the gawking onlookers.\n\n\u201cI am not on anyone\u2019s fucking leash! Nobody tells me what the do! Now what\u2019s going to happen, is I\u2019m going to leave and lay waste to the Brot Kingdom. The rest of you are going to defend this place while I\u2019m gone! And when Velzix comes here, like I know he will I\u2019LL handle it. The rest of you can cower before that fucker, but I ain\u2019t the one.\u201d\n\nHaving made your thoughts known, you return to your undead army, which obediently still stands only awaiting your commands. As the way things should be. The way ALL things should be.\n\nAfter a few days you eventually reach the Brot Kingdom. You start by decimating the small border villages and then quickly raising the peasants you slaughtered. You\u2019ve moved on to larger towns before the Brot military manages to start opposing you. Their military is weak though. Most of them see your horde and run in terror before the fight even begins! Those are the smart ones. The rest soon become just more fodder for you to raise. You actually feel more powerful after your conquests, which is odd given the amount of energy you\u2019ve been expending. You can only take this as a sign of this being what you were meant for!\n\nWithin the week you\u2019ve single handedly taken control of the Brot capitol and most of the Kingdom in general. Much of the royal family has abased themselves before you in an attempt for you to spare their lives. You laugh and grant this request, after all someone has to still run this territory. You\u2019ve successfully subjugated your first territory. In fact, it\u2019s the first \u201creal\u201d territory conquered since Velzix took over the Tulan Kingdom. Tivadol\u2019s petty victories haven\u2019t even compared to what you\u2019ve done.\n\nWhen you return to Aftermath, you\u2019re half expecting to be met by Velzix, who has undoubtedly heard of your actions by now. It\u2019s only now that you realize you may be in more trouble than you thought! However, you\u2019re surprisingly met by Sesisek instead who sits in your study.\n\n\u201cThis place is as dead as my status among demonkind.\u201d He says looking at the many skeletal structures and decorations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fucking necropolis, I\u2019m a necromancer, and what do you want? I figured Velzix would be here meeting me.\u201d\n\u201cOh he\u2019s on his way, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s quite pissed about you playing the role of conqueror. He\u2019s just a little more preoccupied with the Grand Alliance army that\u2019s currently attacking him directly right now, which probably explains why you met little resistance at Brot. Congratulations on your victory, I\u2019m sure Tivadol won\u2019t be too pleased with accomplishing something he couldn\u2019t either.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, so why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help you get out of this shit pit you\u2019ve stepped in and are quickly in danger of sinking further into. You\u2019ve showed entirely too much ambition, too soon, my mortal friend.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of it? Like I\u2019m the only one plotting against Velzix? Hah! Tivadol makes no pretense of his goals.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, but you\u2019re not taking some things into consideration. Tivadol is still a demon and you my mortal friend are not. We are not fond of ever being bested, but to be bested by a mortal is even more repugnant to us. Tivadol is also a predictable loud mouth brute who is never going to achieve his goal. Velzix knows exactly how to manipulate him. Perhaps the day will come where he\u2019ll have to kill him, but that day is far off in the future. You on the other hand are still new and he\u2019s still learning about you. Velzix probably thought you could be manipulated and cowed into submission by his sheer strength and magic abilities alone, but it\u2019s apparent that you aren\u2019t afraid of such things. I could\u2019ve seen that though. Necromancers embrace death; fear of it won\u2019t be a factor. Though there are worse things than death\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGuess you\u2019re proof of that.\u201d You mock.\n\u201cHmm, your pointless barbs at me are quite unproductive and are in fact hindering you. I am offering to help you, I\u2019d advise that you take it before you meet Velzix.\u201d\n\u201cOffering me help huh? I seriously doubt you\u2019re doing this out of kindness.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m doing it because I see an opportunity for revenge and quite frankly, you are the only one that will be able to help me achieve it. However, I assure you that we will both profit greatly from this, if you listen to me. If you don\u2019t want my help though, I shall leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m listening, what are you suggesting?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, no my mortal friend. I would be quite the fool if I told you how to handle Velzix before I got your word that you are in fact accepting my help. ARE you accepting my help?\u201d\n\nSesisek looks at you expectantly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept his help", "result": "Well, you probably could use the help in this matter. Smoothing this out with Velzix is going to be a delicate affair.\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m accepting your help.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Sesisek smiles.\n\nSesisek explains that even if you do manage to talk Velzix into not killing you for your actions, he\u2019s still going to take away your hard earned victory for himself. You can\u2019t let him do this, nor are you to get into a fight with him. Instead you must convince Velzix that you are indeed loyal and would never dream of betraying him, but that you must take a more active role in things if you are to be effective. You must remind him that if you\u2019re doing activity, then Velzix can concentrate more on opening up the portal to back home and victory will come quicker. Finally you must always point out of how weak you are compared to the might of Velzix, remind him that you are but a lowly mortal and will always remain so when compared to a demon lord.\n\nAfter advising you, Sesisek leaves you as he mentions he doesn\u2019t want to be around if things don\u2019t go well. He doesn\u2019t need anymore of Velzix\u2019s anger to spread out to him, but if you happen to be successful; he\u2019ll definitely be around to provide more help in the future\n\nYou feel just by agreeing to this you\u2019ve lost something of yourself. Much like when you allied with Velzix. Maybe you haven\u2019t gone so far to sell your soul and granted you were walking the path of darkness to begin with, but the twisted taint of hell that you\u2019ve been getting deeper into is definitely starting to change you and it\u2019s probably not for the better.\n\nIn any case a couple days pass and Velzix arrives, he\u2019s a little more calm than you were expecting, but he could blow up at any minute.\n\n\u201cSo little necromancer, I hear you have been taking matters into your own hands and acquiring territory yourself. I am displeased that you have done this. The Grand Alliance has been attacking and you\u2019ve been squandering my potential reinforcements elsewhere. What if they had succeeded in breaking through my defenses? I would\u2019ve had no troops to support my position, and much would\u2019ve been lost.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me, but I felt that with the Grand Alliance focusing their attention elsewhere, I believed an attack on the Brot Kingdom would be a good idea. And I might add, it was. The conquest was very successful.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you have dodged the question of what would\u2019ve happened had the Grand Alliance broke through my defenses?\u201d\n\u201cI did not worry about such a thing since I knew they would be no match for a powerful demon lord such as yourself and even if they had, I\u2019m sure you personally could\u2019ve dealt with the few stragglers. They are only mortals after all; they would never be a match for you.\u201d\n\u201cObsequious words little necromancer\u2026I have never heard any such tone from you before. You have always carried an air of arrogance about you. Tell me, is my mere presence enough to make you regret your clumsy attempts at gaining more power?\u201d\n\u201cI fear you have misjudged me in this. I simply feel that my talents have not been used to their full degree, because you believe I shall be treacherous in the future. I have no desire to do such a thing. What would be the point? I could never hope to defeat you anyway. I only wish to be more active in your eventual conquest of this world. I have already proven to be a more competent general than Tivadol.\u201d\n\nVelzix laughs out loud at this last statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Tivadol will be thrilled to hear that a mortal has achieved more in military victories on this world than he has\u2026very well. You wish to choose a more active role, so be it. It will be most amusing to see Tivadol compete with you, perhaps this will even inspire him to succeed, since as you have pointed out, he has yet to conquer an entire kingdom for me like you have\u2026and it IS MY kingdom is it not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is.\u201d You say with a bow.\n\u201cHmm, yes. Well you\u2019ve talked your way out of this one necromancer, but know that I will still be watching you. You had best prove successful in your new active role, but also remember who is in charge and who serves.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nVelzix informs you that since you have taken on this role, he\u2019ll be issuing more orders to you AND that it will be up to you to oversee larger areas of territory (Starting with the recently acquired Brot Kingdom), not just Aftermath. And if you fuck up, you\u2019re going to get fucked up.\n\nAnd with that, you have your new place in the hierarchy\u2026\n\nFour years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you made your alliance with Velzix, so far it\u2019s proven most beneficial more or less.\n\nYou\u2019ve managed to carve out a niche for yourself as a good general, and just in time too since Velzix has been successful in keeping infernal portals open longer which is allowing more demons to come in. While your undead troops are looking to be somewhat \u201cobsolete\u201d your expertise in military planning has assured you a place in this demonic empire.\n\nYou don\u2019t lead demons though of course. They\u2019d never allow such a thing. You lead a strange combination of undead and mortals who have decided to throw their lot in with the infernal forces. Sesisek has even provided you with a few mortals who have displayed an interest in necromancy, allowing you to not carry the weight of up keeping an undead army constantly anymore. While you haven\u2019t completely abandoned your necromantic roots, you\u2019ve been forced to broaden your magical horizons and tap into the infernal plane, which has allowed you to create potent unnatural abominations.\n\nHowever, this type of magic is highly experimental and you\u2019re probably the first one to even attempt it. It\u2019s beginning to take a toll on your deteriorating health, because as they say, you don\u2019t change hell, hell changes you. However your power is keeping you going. You haven\u2019t lost sight that one day you\u2019ll be in charge\u2026\n\nYour immediate rivals haven\u2019t lost sight either, in fact you\u2019ve become more of a threat. Tivadol the Destroyer constantly makes threats that he\u2019ll one day see you crushed underneath his foot. Sinthinia is a little more interested in your relationship with Sesisek and finds the fact that you two are on too good of terms to be very suspicious. Oddly Velzix doesn\u2019t seem worried about this though, or if he is, he hasn\u2019t made it known to you. Indeed he\u2019s been pre-occupied lately with finally opening up a portal permanently to his infernal home. He believes he will soon be successful.\n\nIn the meantime, the Grand Alliance has been hard pressed to hold the line, they are slowly losing ground to you and Tivadol. Heroes from all over the civilized governments have been employed, but so far they\u2019ve have proven unsuccessful in even getting to Velzix, let alone killing him. Vampire assassins however have had a little more luck, but Sinithina\u2019s internal security magic guards have detected them all as soon as they get near Velzix\u2019s fortress.\n\nYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re too thrilled yourself with Velzix opening up a permanent portal as it could certainly make your job a lot harder of killing him in the future. Sesisek, realizes this too and has recently approached you about this.\n\nHe tells you to meet him for a plan to kill Velzix, in a couple days. While you\u2019re in your study pondering what this could entail, you are suddenly \u201cgreeted\u201d with Sinthinia\u2019s presence. Unusual since she\u2019s directly kept her distance from you ever since you conquered the Brot Kingdom. (Indirectly through her spies is another matter however) Whatever she has come to see you for probably isn\u2019t good\u2026or is it?\n\n\n\u201cHmm, this place still reeks of death I see. It is much too cold in this place. Not warm like many of our other conquests. Look how hard my nipples are. Why it\u2019s cold enough to make me almost want to put on clothes\u2026almost.\u201d She says touching herself in a seductive way. You\u2019ve seen her in action before, and you\u2019re not some weak willed fool, so this routine has little effect on you.\n\u201cYeah, well zombies tend to be flammable and I hate the heat, so this grave chill stays. You\u2019ll just have to deal with hard nipples.\u201d\n\u201cHow about YOU deal with them. Hm?\u201d\n\u201cSinthinia what do you want?\u201d\n\u201cBesides your dick in my nice warm body? I want to see you not ruin your most promising career by siding with a loser like Sesisek. I know that the two of you have been collusion together ever since you conquered the Brot Kingdom\u2026a most bold move might I add. Only the first of many. You are obviously a man who knows what he wants and takes it\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Sinthinia is turning on her demonic seduction and getting closer to the point of touching you. You\u2019d be lying if it wasn\u2019t having any effect on you.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026well just get the point Sinthinia!\u201d\n\u201cSee? So forceful! Very well, the point. My point is Sesisek is an obsessed fool who\u2019s time is running out. I know he\u2019s got plans to kill me and Velzix, so far I haven\u2019t exactly determined how he\u2019s going to attempt it, but I know it\u2019s coming soon. My concern is, if YOU have anything to do with such plans. It would be a shame if you did\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell he hasn\u2019t said anything to me about any specific plan.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cAh, careful words you chose without actually lying. You have been hanging around our kind and learning! However you will not dodge me so easily. Specific plan. Specific being the key word. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s approached you about some act of treachery though and just hasn\u2019t given you the details yet.\u201d\n\nYou say nothing and she presses up against you while speaking into your ear so close that she nibbles on it a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as a yes. Know however that you are still not powerful enough to kill Velzix. I am very close to him just like I am very close to you right now and I can tell you with all certainty that you will not be able to defeat him. Not even with that bitter old idiot Sesisek helping you\u2026I advise that you not go down the same path as he is.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? Well if you think we\u2019re doing something, why not just kill us both right now?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how I work my necromantic cutie. Besides, I am giving you a chance to join with a better and more grateful ally in the long run. Namely me. I want you to find out what Sesisek\u2019s plan is and then at the right time, betray him. I would be most grateful.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t trust you. Sesisek trusted you once and look what happened.\u201d\n\u201cSesisek proved to be weak and unworthy of my loyalty, but of course you don\u2019t trust me, nor should you. Still, you think on this, I have offered to become your ally and more if you wish. I run the internal security of Velzix\u2019s empire. Do you not think that having me as an ally would be more beneficial for your future than to stay allied with Sesisek whose plan is surely doomed to failure? I already KNOW he\u2019s planning something. He will be punished soon, along with all that have conspired with him. Stay loyal to him and you\u2019ll suffer his fate. Betray him, and you\u2019ll suddenly find yourself in control of his holdings and have one less potential enemy to worry about. Not to mention you will make me very happy. So happy that I may provide favors for you that you could never dream of. So what do you say?\u201d\n\nNormally you\u2019d think more about it, but Sinthinia has made a somewhat appealing offer and the fact that she\u2019s currently shoved one of her hands down your pants and stroking your cock isn\u2019t exactly helping you think straight either.", "action_results": [{"action": "Agree", "result": "If Sinthinia already knows that something is going on, chances are she\u2019s already got counter measures to solve it. Her overtures for an alliance, must be some what genuine to some degree otherwise she\u2019d just let you go through with this plan and just have you all killed when you attempt it.\n\n\u201cOkay, Sinthinia I\u2019m in.\u201d you say.\n\nSinthinia continues to rub against you and then looks into your eyes before kissing you.\n\n\u201cMmmm, I can taste the truthfulness on your lips. A rare flavor around here. I\u2019m glad you decided to join me; we\u2019re going to have so much fun together. Now, let me taste more of you. Something more\u2026carnal.\u201d\n\nA few hours later Sinthinia leaves your study (Which is now a mess) and remarks that she\u2019ll be expecting to see you soon after you meet with Sesisek.\n\nA few days pass and you meet Sesisek in the forsaken area known as the Drozz Wasteland. The barbarian tribes here still hold sway, but you need not concern yourself with such minor threats, they know enough to stay away from two dark individuals such as yourselves, and the others\u2026\n\nThe others in question are vampires. It would appear that Sesisek has been planning more than just \u201cnormal\u201d betrayal. The vampires eye you warily.\n\n\u201cSo, how did you swing a deal with the vampire clans?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we all have similar interests. And that interest is seeing Velzix die and that bitch Sinthinia.\u201d\n\u201cRemember Sesisek, our primary target is Velzix! Your desire for revenge on other targets is secondary!\u201d one the vampires exclaims.\n\u201cAnd I assure you that taking out Sinthinia is very necessary to our goals as well. She\u2019s head of internal security. Killing her is vital to our plan.\u201d\n\u201cI thought getting Mr. Necromancer here to mask us long enough to enter Veltrix\u2019s fortress was the plan?\u201d\n\u201cHe will be, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey hold on, what am I supposed to be doing now?\u201d you interrupt while exaggerating your clueless act.\n\u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t even informed him yet or what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to do it now!\u201d Sesisek hisses before turning to you. \u201cLook isn\u2019t it true that you can use some sort of necromantic magic to hide our friends here? The reason why assassination attempts have been so unsuccessful before is thanks to all the magic detection security in the fortress.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I see what you\u2019re getting at. Yeah, but I can\u2019t just do it myself. I\u2019d still be giving off too much of a deathly aura that would probably arouse suspicion from Sinthinia\u2019s detection shit. I\u2019d have to enter the fortress with either a bunch of zombies and skeletons, or I suppose I could just enter with a few of my abominations. Those would arouse less suspicion since I use them as bodyguards anyway. You vampires could travel with us invisibly, and you shouldn\u2019t be detected until you decide to go into a blood frenzy and start killing everyone.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! See! I told you he could do it.\u201d\n\nYou all \u201cagree\u201d to this plan and hammer out some other details before parting ways.\n\nYou head back to Aftermath, when your undead abomination bodyguards begin to sniff the air and you feel a presence stalking you, you stop and prepare yourself for an attack. Once again the vampire assassins become visible. Apparently they\u2019ve been following you.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sneak up on a necromancer. I can sense your undead presence remember blood leech?\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you still consider yourself? I thought you\u2019d become a worshipper of demons rather than death, given how long you\u2019ve been with them.\u201d One of the assassins says.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t worship anything. I\u2019m concerned with my own power; all of this is just a means to an end. And I have not given up the necromantic arts; you would be wise to remember that vampire.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Then it\u2019s not too late.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cLook, this plan will be more successful if you fully cooperate with us. After we kill Velzix, Lord Rostov wants to invite you to join us. He feels that your connection and understanding of death along with your power would serve the Clans well. Among us, you would find a sort of peace. You would not have to deal with demons anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be joking! After I kill Velzix, I\u2019m taking over! And anyone who opposes me is going to feel my wrath!\u201d you say still keeping up the illusion that you\u2019re going through with this assassination.\n\nThe vampire assassin runs her fingers through her hair and pauses before speaking again.\n\n\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. And I\u2019m not talking about a knife in your back by one of us either. I\u2019m saying if you believe you\u2019ll be able to control an empire mixed with mortals, demons AND while controlling all your undead troops, then you\u2019re beyond delusional. Look at you. You\u2019re a wreck from all the infernal magic you\u2019ve been taping into. Is it any wonder that demonologists don\u2019t live a long time? It\u2019s probably only due to your baffling plentiful necromantic energy that\u2019s kept you going this long. Even if you do manage to rein in the chaotic nature of the demons, and hold off the Grand Alliance, I doubt you\u2019ll live enough to enjoy any of it, let alone conquer anymore territory.\u201d\n\u201cI guess you bloodsuckers forgot that I can always become a lich.\u201d\n\u201cA lich? There hasn\u2019t been one of those since the time of the Great Lich Lord! The amount of death energy to become one must be huge! You\u2019re not there yet, you\u2019re not likely to get there and you\u2019re not pure enough anyway. You\u2019re tainted too much by hell. While you haven\u2019t directly sold your soul, you\u2019ve thrown your lot in with them long enough to be damned. You will not be allowed to escape death on your own. BUT\u2026becoming one of us will give you a chance. You will defeat death, and live lifetimes.\u201d\n\nYou think on the assassin\u2019s words. Much of what she says is true. You aren\u2019t in the best condition anymore. You\u2019re in pain a lot though you try to ignore it and not display your weakness. As far as being damned, you\u2019re not sure, but it\u2019s probably true. Your thoughts have focused less on death and more on demonic nightmares. The purity of what you once pursued HAS been tainted. You could almost kick yourself for allowing yourself to turn into what you are.\n\nHowever, you wonder if the vampire is just telling you this to get you on their side. They must be worried about you if they want you to join this bad. Of course he could just be lying, but you don\u2019t think so. After being around so many liars you\u2019ve come to see the signs, not to mention your own insights into the undead.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the vampires", "result": "You\u2019ve come to the realization that the assassin is correct. You foresee a long struggle plagued by headache after headache if you continue to deal with these demons. It\u2019s been nothing, but back stabbing and double dealing since you\u2019ve dealt with them. Given your recent \u201calliance\u201d with Sinthinia, you can only expect more of the same from her. Is that what you really want to deal with? Not to mention if Velzix DOES open the portal to his infernal realm he\u2019ll be even more powerful and no matter what you do, you can\u2019t stand against hell alone and the demons would NEVER follow the likes of you.\n\nJoining the vampire clans might not be ideal, but then again nothing you\u2019ve done so far has.\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll join.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. Though I certainly hope you\u2019re being sincere. It would be such a shame if you lying\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo I mean it. My days of walking with demons are going to be at an end soon. One way or another.\u201d\n\nComing to an agreement, you prepare yourself for this assassination attempt. You also plan to have all your undead troops strike at just the right time to cause even more chaos since you won\u2019t be sticking around after Velzix\u2019s death. At least you hope you won\u2019t.\n\nA few days pass and Sesisek tells you that he has everything ready. He mentions he\u2019ll be taking care of Sinthinia personally along with her whole secret service. You\u2019ll meet the vampire assassins in a dead forest near Fury.\n\nYou send Sinthinia a message that you\u2019ll be arriving at Fury to report what Sesisek is planning. She\u2019ll be expecting you, but what will actually happen, will be completely different.\n\nYou make your trek to Fury, without incident with your hidden friends in tow. You take a deep breath before entering the gates where upon you half expect the demon guards to stop you, but nothing happens. You\u2019ve succeeded. Your next move is to get as quickly as possible to Velzix\u2019s inner chambers.\n\nYou don\u2019t get far when an alarm is raised\u2026\n\n\u201cAssassins! Kill them! Sinthinia\u2019s orders!\u201d one of the demon guards says. Suddenly you\u2019re surrounded on all sides\n\nShit, apparently Sinthinia was somewhat wise to your last act of treachery.\n\nYou mentally call out to your undead minions to attack anything living.\n\n\u201cCome on! Secrecy is over! We gotta haul ass to Velzix!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nWhile chaos is reigning in the fortress, you and the vampires easily dispatch those that would attempt to stop you. When you get to Velzix\u2019s inner chambers where he\u2019s attempting to open up a portal to get reinforcements.\n\n\u201cTreachery. I expected this from Sesisek, but I am very disappointed in you. I had such plans\u2026oh well perhaps I will yet get pleasure when I break your bones and have you flayed over the course of a very long and painful torture period. And I assure you, you\u2019ll be very much alive to experience it.\u201d\n\nVelzix\u2019s portal opens and a swarm of demons come pouring out. The vampire assassins waste no time and begin their work with deadly efficiency. Your abominations have less finesse, but they get the job done.\n\nVelzix unleashes horrible infernal magic that causes a couple of the assassins to liquefy. You\u2019re just trying to stay out of the way of most of the fighting and attempting to keep a control over your troops, but you soon realize you\u2019re going to have to play a direct role in his death and unleash your own negative energy bolts at Velzix.\n\nThe battle is brutal, and dead bodies soon litter the chamber. You\u2019re beginning to feel the effects of the energy you\u2019ve expended in this fight. Thankfully Sesisek arrives with some of his mortal lackeys, giving you a breather. He looks like he\u2019s seen a hard battle already, but still has a lot of fight left due to the revenge that fuels his rage.\n\n\u201cVelzix! Your bitch is dead! Now you shall join her!\u201d he shouts and unleashes a flurry of blades upon his former master.\n\nIn the mean time the femal vampire assassin that first approached you comes to help you up.\n\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t killed Velzix yet.\u201d\n\u201cYes we have, look.\u201d\n\nYou look over at the battle between the two demons and its clear Sesisek has the upper hand, literally. He\u2019s chopped off one of the Velzix\u2019s limbs at the forearm. You take the assassin\u2019s advice and leave with her.\n\nAfter a little more fighting to get out of the Fortress, eventually you find refuge in the dead forest again. Chaos has overtaken Velzix\u2019s realm. You doubt if his demonic empire will be able to recover from this, even if he manages to survive.\n\nYou\u2019re so tired that you don\u2019t have time to react when you\u2019re suddenly bitten on the neck and drained of your blood.\n\nYou feel your life force ebb and then disappear completely\u2026\n\nYou die and for a moment you can feel yourself being pulled towards the infernal realm and the hideous tortures that await you there, however you are sudden brought back to the living, so to speak within just a few minutes. You don\u2019t feel the taint of hell within you anymore, but you also feel less powerful in terms of necromantic energy. You can sense that whatever undead troops you raised or controlled have now crumbled or collapsed.\n\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re up. Welcome to your new life. Your blood tasted terrible. Ugh. All tainted and shit. Spat most of it out.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m really one of you now.\u201d You say ignoring her comment and still in awe of your new form.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. But I think you\u2019ll find that you won\u2019t have some of your powers anymore. While this transition does have benefits, it has it\u2019s downsides as well. But I\u2019m sure Lord Rostov will still find you a welcome addition to the clans. I think he\u2019s actually been interested in meeting and talking with you. Been awhile since we had someone new join us. We should go now, the sun will be up soon.\u201d\n\nThe vampire assassin pulls out a black cube like device and presses a few button and you\u2019re whisked away to the Vampire Clan secret fortress. It is there that you begin you new life.\n\nIn the years to come, the chaos caused by Velzix\u2019s demonic empire settles down somewhat. Velzix did indeed die that day in battle with Sesisek, but he did not live long after getting his revenge. He was soon cut down by other demons who saw a grand opportunity to kill the hated traitor. The Grand Alliance once again gained the upper hand as the demonic infighting begins to take its toll. Tivadol the Destroyer who was the last remaining demon with any meaningful leadership skills was eventually struck down in battle by your sister who became a hero. Your parents also survive the chaos. This pleases you, well about your Mom and sister anyway.\n\nAs for you, once again you find yourself under orders, this time by Lord Rostov, but you don\u2019t mind them. You find this life of ruling the mortal world through the shadows to be more appealing and less hassle. While it is true you no longer possess the powers you once had, and may never get them back, you\u2019ve come to be satisfied with less and not living a life in constant pain anymore.\n\nYour existence continues and the future is unknown as the world\u2019s status quo is starting to return, but your life as a necromancer is over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline their offer", "result": "To side with these bloodsuckers would be folly. First of all they would not be asking for you to join them, if they didn\u2019t feel you were a threat. This means you have the upper hand. Second of all, despite what they claim about your dealings with the infernal plane, you ARE still a necromancer, and as such it is not you who should be taking orders from the dead, it is THEY who should be taking orders from YOU! You\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll be able to \u201cbeat\u201d Hell without losing yourself to it. The assassin did make you think somewhat on your future. You\u2019re going to have to be twice as more intimidating than you are if you want to survive, and what you have in store is going to ensure such a thing.\n\n\u201cI shall have to think on it.\u201d You say with a non-committal answer.\n\u201cYes, well you don\u2019t have too much time to do so. I\u201d The assassin says and leaves with her brethren.\n\nYou make your way back to Aftermath and then send a message to Sinthinia that you\u2019ve got the entire plan. When you explain to her what exactly is going to happen, she\u2019s positively having an orgasm at the thought of what she\u2019s going to have done to Sesisek in her special torture chamber. Afterwards you begin to make plans of your own.\n\nA few days pass and Sesisek tells you that he has everything ready. He mentions he\u2019ll be taking care of Sinthinia personally along with her whole secret service. You\u2019ll meet the vampire assassins in a dead forest near Fury.\n\nYou send Sinthinia a message that you\u2019ll be arriving at Fury to report what Sesisek is planning. She\u2019ll be expecting you, but what will actually happen, will be completely different.\n\nWhen you meet the vampire assassins, you arrive in a \u201churried and disheveled\u201d state so that you look like you\u2019ve been in an attack. They\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cThey found out about the plan! Someone found out and told Sinthinia and Velzix! I barely survived an ambush! I\u2019ve definitely made my decision, I\u2019m joining you!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what makes you think our offer still stands?\u201d the female assassin asks\n\u201cBecause I risked my life to even warn you guys about this! I could\u2019ve just ran off and left you here waiting for the demon detachment that\u2019s on its way now! You also still obviously need all the help you can get to defeat Velzix, and he\u2019s only gotten closer to opening up his permanent portal. I still can be of use, I still have vital information that can hamper his goal, but we need to get out of here right now! Take me, or don\u2019t, but you have nothing to lose by taking me with you, after all I am currently depleted and hopelessly out numbered by your kind.\u201d\n\nThe female assassin turns to her fellow vampires and they converse a second before agreeing.\n\n\u201cVery well, we\u2019ll take you. I hope for your sake you\u2019ll have something of importance to tell Lord Rostov, or you\u2019ll find yourself trading one death for another. And you will still have to prove yourself more before we\u2019ll make you one of us.\u201d\n\nYou nod, and contain your smile. The vampire assassin pulls out a black cube like device and presses a few button and you\u2019re whisked away to the Vampire Clan secret fortress.\n\nNow to put your plan into action\u2026\n\nSuddenly you greatly draw upon the hellish energy of the infernal realm and summon the very souls being tormented there to assist you. Stealing from hell like this is a very dangerous task and you feel very drained, but you manage to maintain your control.\n\nThe vampire assassins barely have time to react before the hellfire spirits set them on fire on the inside out as them attempt to enter their soulless shells, looking for a new \u201chome\u201d. The short lived screams of the vampires is one of extreme agony, proving that even the undead may feel pain.\n\n\u201cYES! Onward my tormented slaves! There are many corporeal shells for you to inhabit!\u201d\n\nYou walk calmly through the Vampire Clan Fortress as the hellfire spirits slaughter the vampires with ease. The screams begin to grow on you. You may be a necromancer, but you think now you have a better understanding of what it means to be a demon. Your thoughts have become steadily more twisted with each passing blood leech death.\n\nFinally you reach Lord Rostov. He looks very regal and dignified even when certain doom awaits him. He says nothing merely attempts to fend off your fiery minions. He does better than his underlings, but ultimately he too is burned to a crisp, putting an end to the vampire clans once and for all.\n\nNow it\u2019s just you alone with several of these burning souls still screaming for a host body. You\u2019re barely keeping them from attacking you and you begin to dismiss them immediately, sending them back to hell. Except one. One which you have plans for and are going to take the ultimate gamble with.\n\nLetting your guard down you release the spirit from your command which enters inside your body.\n\nYou\u2019ve felt pain before as you\u2019ve slowly aligned yourself with hell, but none of it has ever compared to this. Your whole inside of your body is literally on fire. You feel the organs in your body rise in temperature, and explode as they burn up. There is no way you should be surviving this, but something else within you has taken control.\n\nYour will and your desire for one. Your unnatural ties to necromantic energy for another.\n\n\u201cNO! I will NOT die like this! YOU are MY servant and I am the master here! I will be master of ALL! You will obey me and cease this behavior instantly!\u201d you bellow, as your vocal cords burn away making your \u201cbellow\u201d sound more like a terrible hissing raspy sound.\n\nYou collapse and continue burning and convulsing on the stone floor trying to fight off death and tame this disobedient spirit. After about a day of this, the transformation is complete.\n\nWhat you are exactly is questionable however. Are you alive? Are you undead? Are you a demon? Perhaps you\u2019re all three now.\n\nThe tormented hell spirit is still within what\u2019s left of your burned body, though you\u2019ve completely absorbed whatever \u201cfree will\u201d it might\u2019ve had. The pain is still there though somewhat duller. You probably shouldn\u2019t be feeling anything given that all your nerves have been destroyed and technically being dead and all, but the powers of hell are known to extend pain even after death. You know it\u2019s somehow keeping you alive, but at a heavy duty price obviously.\n\nYou get up wracked with pain all over your blackened and smoldering body. If you were a mess before, you\u2019re a complete wreck now, but you\u2019ve gained more power than you ever could\u2019ve while as a mortal. And you\u2019ve not only swindled death, but hell as well. You\u2019ve achieved something even the Great Lich Lord didn\u2019t do.\n\nAnd if all goes as planned you\u2019ll achieve ANOTHER thing he didn\u2019t do.\n\nBut first you\u2019ll go check on your new \u201cally\u201d Sinthinia.\n\nWhen you leave the Vampire Clan Fortress, you find that Velzix\u2019s realm had to put down a very small rebellion. Sesisek seeing that his plan had gone to complete shit when you and the vampires didn\u2019t arrive decided he was going to go ahead with it anyway. He and a few thousand foolish mortals that followed him attacked in open revolt. He didn\u2019t last long before he was easily put down. You were actually thought to be dead (Which isn\u2019t entirely inaccurate) while you were undergoing your new transformation and struggling to survive the process, all the undead that you had under your control slumped back to death again. A few of your acolytes picked up the slack, but given how many undead troops that suddenly dropped, it was still assumed that someone had killed you.\n\nHow surprising it was for Sinthinia when you went to meet her in private. The first being to be graced in the presence of your new form. Not surprisingly she didn\u2019t recognize you at first, she\u2019s even a little unnerved. You like that.\n\n\u201cAh, lovely Sinthinia\u2026you were quite right to choose me as an ally. Even in this new form I would still find it quite a shame to destroy such a beautiful form\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026you? I thought\u2026where the fuck have you been and\u2026what the hell are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell. Hell\u2019s exactly what I am.\u201d You hideously laugh.\n\nYou proceed to explain the whole story since you feel in a mood to do so. She\u2019s very fascinated by the process since even she didn\u2019t know it was possible for a mortal to achieve something like this. She seems particularly intrigued by the fact that you\u2019re in a lot of pain constantly.\n\nShe mentions that Velzix will probably start being more concerned with you, but of course you care not for such matters. You\u2019ve defeated Death, you\u2019ve cheated Hell, what\u2019s one demon lord?", "action_results": [{"action": "Once again you enter a new stage of your journey", "result": "Chapter 4: Damned\n\n\n\nFive years have passed\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since you allied with Velzix, an alliance that\u2019s becoming more tenuous with each passing day.\n\nStartled by your transformation and surge in power, Velzix proceeded to work extra hard on opening the portal, which he did...permanently. Velzix now has unlimited reinforcements, but you do as well. Your new found abilities allow you to not only summon the torments spirits of the infernal plane, but you soon were also able to raise dead demons as hellish undead. Something that couldn\u2019t be accomplished before, by any being. Not even the Great Lich Lord. Combine this with your other regular necromantic abilities and you\u2019re a severe threat with completely loyal troops who will have to be dealt with soon as far as Velzix is concerned. But for now, the alliance still stands. Your other \u201cally\u201d Sinthinia still maintains her grip on her spy network, but it\u2019s of little importance to you now. You\u2019ve completely filled your holdings with undead be they former mortals or demons. None of them are going to rat on whatever it is you\u2019re plotting.\n\nAs for the \u201cGrand Alliance\u201d it\u2019s in its death rattle. The Zalan Empire has basically taken full control of it, but even with more of a unified leadership, this last hope for mortals is doomed. You don\u2019t even know why they persist in struggling. You alone have pushed your undead hell legions towards the gates of the capitol yourself, beating that idiotic Tivadol to the punch. You hear of how he roars with rage at your successes.\n\nHaving accomplished this feat, and despite your transformation, your thoughts can\u2019t help, but turn to your family. It\u2019s been years since you\u2019ve had any kind of direct contact with them. You know your Mom still lives in the capitol of the Zalan Empire and that your sister is still currently holding the last pitiful lines of defense there as a general.\n\nAs for your Dad\u2026well you know exactly where he\u2019s at right now. He\u2019s in your dungeon. Sinthinia recently had him captured after he and his company had been waging an ongoing guerilla tactic campaign of irritating raids on Velzix\u2019s Realm. When you found out, you insisted that he be brought to you and she was only too happy to oblige, knowing that your dislike of him, only grew and festered into full blown hatred after your transformation.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true you\u2019re supposed to oversee the destruction of the Zalan capitol personally, you\u2019re going to enjoy yourself in tormenting the one who sired you first.\n\nYou open the door to his cell and see a beaten and bloody old man. No longer is he the figure of intimidation that you once quaked in fear of when he was around. His wounds are recent from the lashes he\u2019s been taking. You decided it would be best to start off with the basics before moving on to more elaborate tortures.\n\nHowever, upon seeing you, he manages to compose himself the best he can.\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026too chicken shit to do your own dirty work, huh?\u201d he says spitting blood.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find that by letting others do my dirty work, I\u2019m actually showing mercy. Because when I starting doing it, you won\u2019t be in any condition to perform this poor attempt of bravado.\u201d\n\nYour Dad finally stands up and addresses you more directly. He looks at you and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cYou think by killing me, that you\u2019re proving something? You ain\u2019t proving shit boy except what a lousy disappointment you truly are. Now your sister, THERE\u2019S a child to be proud of. Even yer mother gave up on you. Broke her heart you know that?\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe this arrogance!\n\n\u201cFeh, aligning yourself with the hordes of hell, I always knew you were too weak to do anything on your own. You couldn\u2019t even follow the path of darkness without help.\u201d Your Dad mocks.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing this, but he\u2019s actually managing to get to you. You\u2019re tired of hearing this and you cast a spell that strips a portion of his skin off. He falls to the floor in pain.\n\n\u201cYou will NOT dictate your judgment on me! I am beyond such things now, especially from the likes of you! A blood thirsty thug who committed more than a few atrocities in his day and up until I began my path of darkness, was still committing foul deeds under the guise of law. You are no better than me!\u201d\n\u201cWrong again boy. I cleaned up my act\u2026heh heh, okay maybe not completely. But I ain\u2019t never got myself in league with demons. Let alone turn myself into some unnatural\u2026thing. Yer dammed boy. And while you might think you\u2019re going to be controlling everything, you ain\u2019t. You don\u2019t control hell boy, it controls you. Yer nothin\u2019 but a slave to...\u201d\n\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d you shout and kick him before he can complete his sentence. The rage building up in you is enough to twist steel, but still your Dad mocks you. He\u2019s laughing!\n\n\u201cHa ha ha, broke yer mother\u2019s heart\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have time for this right now. You\u2019re supposed to oversee the final attack of the Zalan capitol, and you\u2019re still going to do that, and your Dad is going to feel the pain when you come back. In the meantime he can rot in his cell.\n\nYou arrive and the final attack is ordered. You storm the gates as cannons destroy multitudes of your troops only to be replaced with more. You see your sister on top of the battlements ordering her soldiers to fire upon you. During this attack you feel several bullets enter your body breaking through your magical defenses. You ignore the pain, as its nothing compared to what you\u2019ve been exposed to.\n\nNot stopping, you enter the gates of the city realizing that this was inevitable. Things could\u2019ve only been this way. Your undead slay all those that oppose you, but you mentally make sure none of your undead has murderous intentions towards any of your family. You have special plans for them. You head towards your parent\u2019s old house, taking little notice of the death around you.\n\nWhen you arrive you find the house empty. In fact it looks like it\u2019s been empty for months. So many memories here\u2026a different time\u2026 even a different life now\u2026\n\n\u201cShe left when the attacks first came. She didn\u2019t say where either. She just told me she was leaving. I even had her followed for awhile, but she was quite adept at eluding my scouts, not to mention I had other concerns to take care of.\u201d Your sister says entering behind you.\n\n\u201cMom always was smart, well except maybe when it came to Dad, but he\u2019s rotting in my torture cell right now. So who cares?\u201d you remark.\n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t make her sense of concern noticeable by your revelation, but instead looks upon you with complete disgust.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve let yourself become what you are. What you\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that one is capable of quite a bit, when one sets their mind to it. Even the demons fear me and I have only myself to congratulate. Soon they too will fall\u2026perhaps this is a lingering sense of brotherly concern, but you could join me in this. You would be a great asset in the coming war with Velzix. Perhaps I could even help you transform as well.\u201d\n\nShe spits on the floor, and then raises her magical glowing sword.\n\n\u201cI thought as much.\u201d\n\nYou blast your sister with powerful beam of negative energy causing the color to drain from her face. She\u2019s still continues towards you, but another blast causes her to fall.\n\nShe\u2019s near death and your twisted mind still ponders what to do. Your sister was a great warrior, and you weren\u2019t joking when she would be a great asset to you if she was on your side. You\u2019re sure if given enough time and using the right magic rituals you could transform her like you did to yourself. Part of you also still has your Dad\u2019s words of how she was someone to be proud of ringing in your head. Transforming her into a vessel of evil would be destroying that image in your mind.", "action_results": [{"action": "Transform her", "result": "Overcome with irrational hatred and jealousy of an opinion that technically shouldn\u2019t matter to you at all, you grab your sister\u2019s body and have dark plans for it. Even better, you\u2019re going to have your Dad see exactly what you\u2019re going to do. Two tortures in one.\n\nYou infuse her with a bit of unholy energy to keep her alive. As you\u2019re leaving one of your mortal necromancers approaches you in the middle of the chaos.\n\n\u201cUh sir, we\u2019ve taken over the city. The royal family was butchered in their own throne room.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Yeah, yeah. Well you know what to do, recruit the weak willed, kill the resisters, and raise the dead. I got more important things to do.\u201d\n\nYou take your sister back to Aftermath and begin your work. You start to perform rituals and have your Dad watch every reprehensible act you do to your sister over the course of several weeks. She slowly goes from becoming a noble warrior to a malevolent murderer. She screams in pain from the vile assaults upon her mind and body. For the first time you think you\u2019ve seen your Dad weep and display any kind of emotion. He even begs you to stop, which really make you smile.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to represent the final act of your work, you approach your Dad who\u2019s a completely broken man at this point.\n\n\u201cSee, and look upon your pride and joy now Dad. You were proud of her because she was everything she represented that you weren\u2019t right? She shook off the brutality and replaced it with nobility. She wasn\u2019t a self-serving mercenary; she was a duty bound fighter who believed in something. So much so that she was willing to try to kill me even though the odds were against her. She chose a path because it was what she BELIEVED in, not something she became due to falling under some spell like you did. Well guess what? I CHOSE my path too. And I\u2019ve chose to turn your beloved daughter into you. Did you know she had the capacity for great evil already? Guess your genes are always there, no matter how much you try to deny them. I had to look deep, but I found that part of her. That darkest part of her hates, her violent tendencies, all of it. I nurtured and coaxed it out through\u2026well I think you saw most of the process. Now behold my greatest achievement since my ascension.\u201d\n\nYou sister comes from behind the door; she looks much different than from what your Dad remembers. No longer is she a force of good, but one of evil. Of course though you\u2019ve made sure she\u2019s totally obedient to you. The tormented hell soul that inhabits her body is completely under your command. It causes her great pain, but then again so are you. Why should you be the only one who suffers?\n\nShe sneers at you as she walks towards your Dad. You can feel her hatred toward you, yet she knows she cannot do anything toward you. Instead she takes it out on your Dad who can only give a mournful look of what she\u2019s become before he\u2019s hacked to bits in a bloody fury.\n\nYes, she will certainly be a terror on the battlefield, you think.\n\n\n\nTen years pass\u2026\n\nTwenty years have passed, and the world has tilted firmly into the grip of evil. Demons pour into this world more and more each day. The Grand Alliance is dead and the \u201ccivilized\u201d governments of mortals have fallen to demonic hordes or your own undead ones. Pockets of resistance always exist, but they will soon fall in time as well.\n\nWith the success of your sister\u2019s transformation, you proceeded to pick other powerful mortals and unnaturally twist them to your will, turning them into something more than demon, more than undead and certainly more than human. They are much like you except they are completely obedient to your will. They hate you of course for their painful existence, but is it not the way of all children to want to kill their father?\n\nPerhaps Hell has changed you, but you\u2019ve made quite a few changes to Hell\u2026\n\nOf more immediate concern is Velzix, who demanded years ago that you stop your experiments on mortals. He and most of the other pure blood demons already didn\u2019t like the fact you could raise their dead, but they REALLY didn\u2019t like how you were achieving something that they hadn\u2019t thought of, let alone even accomplish. Of sure a few can possess a body, or turn an idiot to evil, but how many can create a whole new \u201crace\u201d of beings who are rivaling them in wickedness yet subservient to their creator? Of course you told Velzix to fuck off and there begun a civil war.\n\nYour undead, mortal servants and Hellbred warriors now control your territory known as the Forsaken Dominion. Velzix still calls his territory \u201cVelzix\u2019s Realm\u201d but it\u2019s primarily inhabited by demons now, though mortal slave do serve them under their clawed heels. Neither place is particularly appealing to any right and good thinking being though.\n\nTivadol the Destroyer was the first fool to directly challenge you. He decided that if he could get you out of the way, he could prove that he was the ultimate warrior and easily take Velzix\u2019s place. He soon found out how poor his judgment was, when your sister personally slew him on the battlefield and his now undead shell serves her every whim and take her every abuse. Sinthinia broke off her so called alliance with you, and somehow managed to ingratiate herself back in Velzix\u2019s good graces. Perhaps your actions really have put the fear into them. Indeed there is less infighting occurring in Velzix\u2019s Realm nowadays.\n\nThis new unified front the demons have put up is the only thing that\u2019s really giving you problems as of late. Get them to start fighting amongst themselves again and you\u2019ll be able to roll over them.\n\nYou were here first. You\u2019re going to rule this world, nobody else.\n\nYou get an idea. You know the demons hate your new Hellbred creations yet you\u2019re pretty sure Velzix wouldn\u2019t mind having some on his side. He\u2019s merely using this new found unity to his advantage, just like he\u2019d use your creations to his advantage as well.\n\nYou decide to stage a small revolt, though you\u2019re not telling anyone about it. Only you\u2019ll know the truth. You figure your sister would be the best one to start with since it\u2019s well known how much she loathes you even amongst the enemy.\n\nThe first revolt in the Dominion is set off by your sister. She slays several of your mortal servants, some of them even necromancers. Undead die by the droves. You could care less. This is for a greater goal and after all, you\u2019ll just raise them again later. The second revolt occurs next and then another. By the end of the month several of your Hellbred warriors have rebelled and some have even acquired small contingencies of mortal followers.\n\nAll of this grabs Velzix\u2019s attention. He moves in to take your weakened areas, but he also sends feelers out to these rebel Hellbreds. Since this was supposed to be impossible he\u2019s very interested to see if he can use them against you\u2026\n\nExcellent the first part of the plan is set.\n\nHe has Sinthinia approach them, as he\u2019s still too smart to directly face them. The cowardly demon lord hasn\u2019t left his magically fortified inner chamber in years. Of course Sinthinia has her own personal guards approach them first since she\u2019s not risking her life either. Of course the Hellbreds act appropriately hostile and suspicious, but mention how much they hate being used as your pawns and how arrogant you were to think that you could control them just because you created them. They want nothing more than your death.\n\nThat response is enough for Velzix to start offering them positions in his armies. They accept of course. At first they\u2019re just kept to their own units, but after Velzix wins some territory from you (More than he has in years) he realizes their efficiently would be better spread out to maximize there fighting skills and strategic minds. He begins to have them lead demon contingencies.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t go over well.\n\nPart two of the plan has come about.\n\nSoon the demons begin to resent Velzix\u2019s decision. Saying that he\u2019s favoring these Hellbreds over them. Velzix tell them he\u2019ll do what he wants as he\u2019s the leader and what he says goes. Sinthinia doesn\u2019t like this either and mentions that he\u2019s stirring trouble by pursuing this course of action and she doesn\u2019t like the fact that she can\u2019t sense what they\u2019re thinking or feeling like a normal (or not so normal) living creature, but Velzix insists he\u2019s doing the right thing since he\u2019s winning the war against you now.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before the demons revert back to their chaotic natures and start getting disobedient with their new Hellbred \u201ccompanions\u201d. Now you have your Hellbred stop holding back and lash out which they do in violent ways. This of course causes the death of several Hellbreds, but these acts cause a greater spiral of destruction.\n\nDemons begin fighting among themselves again, arguing that Velzix doesn\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019s doing and isn\u2019t worth following since he trusted these creatures to lead. Velzix has REAL rebellions going on all over his Realm. Portions of it begin to split away from the whole and several demons begin forming their own warlord domains. Domains that you easily conquer as you bring your full unified force to bear. Eventually Velzix\u2019s reputation isn\u2019t strong enough anymore and he can\u2019t bring enough reinforcements anymore to help, as the knowledge of his failures have spread even to the infernal planes. In fact he has to close up his portal just so other opportunistic demon lords don\u2019t come around to finish him off, he\u2019s having enough problems with you. You get the impression that Sinthinia had something to do with that as she disappeared soon after this elaborate deception came about. (Possibly her \u201cparting shot\u201d at Velzix who she never had any true loyalty to anyway and fled back to the infernal plane to save her own skin)\n\nNow the endgame begins\n\nYour sister storms Velzix\u2019s fortress with an army larger than the one used to storm the Zalan capitol ten years ago. You never even have to dirty your hands, and you heard he was slain with ease by your sister. When she presents his head to you, you do something you haven\u2019t done in a long time. Grant act of mercy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve served me well dear sister, let this be your final reward.\u201d\n\nYou snuff out the tormented spirit inhabiting your sister which releases her from her painful servitude and allows her to die.\n\nNow nothing stands in your way, Velzix\u2019s hasty actions of closing the portal have made things even easier for you. No longer do you have to deal with these interloping demons any longer. You\u2019ve suffered their kind long enough. Even from the very beginning when Big Red gave you shit when you tried to buy a book on necromancy from him, how long ago that was...\n\nYou vow to have every last one of them killed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Godhood?", "result": "Thirty years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been fifty years since you set out on the path of darkness.\n\nEvery demon on this world has indeed been hunted down and killed.

You\u2019ve stomped out every wannabe hero/last hope/chosen one whenever they\u2019ve presented themselves. Such idealism is the past. A few times there have been a few of your necromancer underlings that have attempted to have you killed, but such attempts are futile and the conspirators are typically caught, tortured and then killed.\n\nMost mortals know better than to stand against you now though. You have done something remarkable in your cruel iron fist and that is the fact you\u2019ve brought peace to the world at last. Nobody fights on any meaningful major scale anymore. All mortals, from the lowliest goblin to the haughtiest elf (Though there aren\u2019t too many of the latter left) all obey your terrible will and seek to become one of your many undead minions when they ultimately die.

Why did they allow this to happen? Why have they not stopped you, if this was not destined to happen?\n\nYou\u2019re of the mind that the gods of this world either never existed or cowered in fear of your rising power and abandoned it long ago.\n\nWhile you ponder these questions in the solitude of your study and decide that you ARE a god, you are suddenly visited by the contrary.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, this turned out a lot better than I expected. I guess it was good I placed my faith in you\u2026ha ha faith. Probably not the most appropriate word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one right now.\u201d\n\nYou turn around to see a face you thought dead long ago. Even you are surprised, and that rarely happens nowadays. How he got in here you have no idea.\n\n\u201cBig Red?\u201d\n\u201cYep, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cI saw you dead. Years ago.\u201d\n\u201cOh that, yeah well let\u2019s just say that wasn\u2019t me or at least no the real me. Doesn\u2019t matter. This world is ready for the infernal plane.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me? Just because you have somehow managed to cheat death, do not presume that you can challenge me. I am god here. This world is mine and mine alone.\u201d\n\nBig Red laughs and then you feel a sudden paralysis over come you. Powerful magic is at work here and you can\u2019t do anything about it. Your anger rages.\n\n\u201cThis world COULD\u2019VE been yours, had you chosen a different path, tis true. But the day you came to me, was the day that path ended. I knew a change in this world was coming long before you showed up, and not necessarily one in my favor. The stench of death had risen once more just like in the days before the Great Lich Lord,. in fact I was already to haul my red ass back to the infernal realm. I already went through that shit once, didn\u2019t feel like dealing with it again. Mortals are certainly fun to be around, but the undead\u2026never cared for them. If they were going to retake this world, I saw no point in staying. Demons are indeed assholes, but hey I can related to them.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I get free, I\u2019m going to make you beg for death!\u201d you yell while he continues his speech.\n\u201cHowever, when you came to me, I could sense the great power of necromancy flowing in you. Oh sure Mr. Demar and his motley crew THOUGHT they were dark wizards, but their power paled in comparison to what I sensed in you. I thought about killing you right then and there to stop the possible dead onslaught, but then I thought why do that, when I can bend and taint you to infernal purposes?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do shit! I DID THIS ALL!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you think so, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted you to believe. Those necromantic books you took from my place when you found my dead body were infused with hell magic, secret languages from my home. Of course if you had been a little more experienced in such matters you might\u2019ve caught on, but you were too eager to start raising the dead to not realize that the seeds were slowly taking root in your mind. I watched you turn slowly away from the purity of death and begin to consort with demons. The moment you allied with that blowhard Velzix I knew then the seeds had taken started to bloom.\u201d\n\u201cNO! You\u2019re lying!\u201d\n\u201cIt was a good thing that my plan worked too, because it stunted your potential power. The purity of your unnatural link to the dead was spoiled and ultimately severed long ago. Who knows how powerful you could\u2019ve gotten had I not intervened? Maybe you would\u2019ve surpassed the Great Lich Lord. Why you might\u2019ve ascended into godhood. Scary to think about the road not traveled eh?\u201d\n\u201cLIAR! LIAR!\u201d\n\u201cWell okay I can\u2019t take credit for ALL your decisions, but come on. When you began summoning tormented souls from the infernal realm, did you really think you could\u2019ve gotten away with that without some kind of help? You were STEALING from Hell. Then when you transformed yourself you were going beyond normal hubris. Not even our kind has the balls to defy Hell itself. You wouldn\u2019t believe how hard it was to convince the high ups to let you get away with it. Your Hellbred experiment made things even worse, but in the end it was all worth it. Hell\u2019s getting an entire world in return and their stolen souls back.\u201d\n\nThis revelation\u2026you don\u2019t want to believe it, but somehow the hard reality is crashing down upon you, and the paralysis wears off and you suddenly feel completely drained as you fall to the floor.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2026I was in control the whole time\u2026I\u2019m just\u2026just a puppet\u2026a slave\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re ALL slaves to Hell, my dead friend. Its just all of the question how high up you are in the hierarchy you are. You might\u2019ve been allowed some leniency, and been allowed to be my second in command, but as I said your grand theft soul displeased the high ups. So you gotta pay. Pay dearly I\u2019m afraid. Shame really, you really were quite efficient at your work, but having someone like you around would\u2019ve been dangerous to my well being anyway. I think Sinthinia will be more fun than you\u2019d be as well. She\u2019s proved a most useful spy and saboteur through this whole endeavor. She was the one who told you to look behind the toilet for the necromantic books fifty years ago after all.\u201d\n\nIts just one deception upon another as the plot has unfolded to prove how you were lead down the path to Hell. Now there\u2019s just one more thing as you\u2019re crumpled miserably on the floor hoping that all of this is some bad dream, but of course when Big Red crouches next to you and grabs your wrist this is all too real.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been said time and time again, but you chose to ignore it. You don\u2019t change Hell, Hell changes you. And it\u2019s changed not only you, but this world as well. Time for both of you to come home necromancer.\u201d\n\nAnd with these last words, the entire world is transported into the infernal plane where Big Red is allowed to run it as he sees fit. All your undead and Hellbred are destroyed instantly as your powers are stripped away immediately. Hell gave you your powers, and now it\u2019s taking them away. Drawing back ALL its energy it ever gave you.\n\nYou now lay in some forsaken deep pit of Hell completely helpless.

Lasted longer than you expected, but then again he was always tough.\n\nTen years pass\u2026\n\n\n\nTwenty years have passed, and the world has tilted firmly into the grip of evil. Demons pour into this world more and more each day. The Grand Alliance is dead and the \u201ccivilized\u201d governments of mortals have fallen to demonic hordes or your own undead ones. Pockets of resistance always exist, but the damage they do is negligible. There is little hope left.\n\nAs for your own \u201calliance\u201d that also no longer exists. You and Velzix couldn\u2019t exist together any longer and the need to destroy each other was finally unleashed. The land is split and your territory is known as the Forsaken Dominion. The war goes on for years in a bloody seesaw event.\n\nTivadol the Destroyer attempts to raise his own status by trying to launch an all out assault upon you. Hoping that by killing you personally, everyone will see he\u2019s a better leader than Velzix. His fanatical berserker troops do much damage initially, but soon even they fall before the relentless hordes of undead. By the time Tivadol gets to the inner reaches of your lands, he\u2019s fighting by himself. He dies in an onslaught of wraiths, wrights, skeletons and all other manner of undead.\n\nSinthinia who once again sided with Velzix during this split sends some of her personal assassins after you. More than a few times they nearly ended your existence. With each one you killed you had their corpses kept in a cell. Then when you felt you had enough of them in your possession, you raised them and ordered them to use their skills to kill Sinthinia and Velzix. Velzix proved to evade this fate, but Sinthinia wasn\u2019t so lucky and died by the hands of her own assassins.\n\nStill even with these successes, you aren\u2019t gaining too much ground. Velzix just replenishes his army with more demons coming from the infernal plane. The only way to stop that from happening is to close the motherfucker, and quite frankly you\u2019re about the only one on your side powerful enough to do it. You prepare to make a large scale attack into Velzix\u2019s Realm.\n\nAfter a long hard fight you manage to close the infernal portal, cutting off his troop supply. Of course after having done this, you realize you\u2019re already deep in his territory. He\u2019s close. Why stop there? He\u2019ll just open it again later, and you ARE trying to kill him\u2026\n\nNot stopping, you assault his nearby fortress Fury. With each demon you kill they cut down ten of your undead. They make you pay for every success, to the point that you even have to conserve some of your energy to stop raising the dead to replenish your losses. You\u2019ve expended enough as it is closing the portal, you\u2019ll need all you have to defeat Velzix.\n\nEventually you reach Velzix\u2019s inner chamber. He bellows and makes his usual threats of how he\u2019s going to make you pay and such. It\u2019s all so boring now. You\u2019ve heard it all before. You don\u2019t bother with your own remarks, because you\u2019ve also said it all before too.\n\nThe pair of you engage in combat, casting every terrible spell imaginable and destroying portions of the fortress in the process.

He wastes no time in following up and after he\u2019s done, you can even feel yourself losing grip on the hellish magics keeping you alive. However, you vow if you\u2019re not winning neither is Velzix. You expend your last bit of power and blast Velzix in the face with a combination of negative energy and hellfire.

You\u2019re actually surprised he\u2019s coming down here instead of summoning you to his fortress instead.\n\n\n\u201cSo little necromancer, I hear you have been taking matters into your own hands and acquiring territory yourself. I am displeased that you have done this. The Grand Alliance has been attacking and you\u2019ve been squandering my potential reinforcements elsewhere. What if they had succeeded in breaking through my defenses? I would\u2019ve had no troops to support my position, and much would\u2019ve been lost.\u201d\n\u201cWell if that had happened I guess I would\u2019ve had to take over.\u201d\n\nThat remark wasn\u2019t the best one you could\u2019ve made, but you can\u2019t contain yourself for some reason.

Do not think that you are going to build up some power base to betray me later, because that is not going to happen if you value your existence! So you better just put such thoughts out of your mind right now and fall in line!\u201d\n\nVelzix hasn\u2019t raised his voice too much, but there is definitely a very real threat there.

You certainly have the upper and hand, and Velzix realizes that you\u2019re more powerful than he thought, but unfortunately for you, he manages to get away.\n\n\u201cLITTLE MORTAL YOU HAVE NOT WON THIS DAY!

This not only weakened your position, but his as well, allowing the Grand Alliance army to break through and retake the Tulan Kingdom. Velzix and his cohorts were all slain. After this occurred, most of the demons fled into the wilderness only to be hunted down and killed. A few even ran to you, you accepted them since you needed all the help you could get at that point.\n\nAfter taking care of Velzix, The Grand Alliance wasted no time in attacking you. You tried to maintain your holdings, but ultimately you lost your grip on the Brot Kingdom, when the royal family there once again switched alliances (Though to no avail as the Grand Alliance took them all into custody and had them executed for treason) Soon you were just left with Aftermath. When the Grand Alliance wasn\u2019t trying to break down the gates, you had vampire assassins attempting to kill you.\n\nIn fact right now, you are dying from several deep blade wounds from their latest attack.

Velzix has been successful in keeping infernal portals open longer which is allowing more demons to come in. The Grand Alliance has been hard pressed to hold the line and it seems like more and more mortals each day are willing to bend before demonic might.\n\nYour undead troops aren\u2019t even necessary for defense too much anymore. Because of this you\u2019ve been forced to broaden your magical horizons and tap into the infernal plane.

It\u2019s beginning to take a toll on your rapidly deteriorating health, because as they say, you don\u2019t change hell, hell changes you. Everyday you\u2019re in pain and probably losing what little of your black soul you have left.

He is very open about his plan to you and explains that he has been in contact with Lord Rostov and working out a deal with the Vampire Clans that will be beneficial to him. This deal could be extended to you as well, provided you are helpful enough. Another group of vampire assassins have managed to make their way into the heart of Velzix\u2019s Realm, but if they are to strike they need to do it now, before Sinthinia\u2019s internal security forces sniff them out once again. Sesisek\u2019s job was to sneak them into Fury without too much opposition, given that you\u2019re in on this plan now, you could do a better job since your necromantic magic could mask the vampire assassins\u2019 movements. He mentions he will set up the plan and while you and the bloodsuckers are heading to Velzix\u2019s chamber, Sesisek says he will be dealing with Sinthinia personally. It will also provide a diversion.\n\nA day passes and you\u2019re preparing yourself for the battle of your life. You memorize every powerful spell you can think of and strengthen up your undead minions. When this goes down there is no turning back, so you\u2019re just going to order all of them to attack the moment Sesisek\u2019s attack on Sinthinia becomes known and an alarm is raised. Hopefully the added chaos will help.\n\nAnother day passes and Sesisek sees you fairly early in the morning. He mentions that the assassins will meet you by the dead forest nearby when darkness falls. He hopes you\u2019ve prepared yourself, because it was very hard to convince them in this change of plans.\n\nWhen darkness comes, you take a few of your hellish undead abominations with you and make your way to the dead forest. Once fairy folk and the like frolicked here, now it\u2019s just a group of desiccated tree husks waiting to be taken away to build more war machines. Your powers in necromancy aren\u2019t quite as pure as they used to be thanks to the tainting of hellish magics, but you can still sense the assassins are close by. You aren\u2019t taken by surprised when they materialize around you. Indeed you have your abominations to act if they try anything.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re Velzix\u2019s little necromancer eh? You don\u2019t look like much.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cMaybe, but you ain\u2019t getting in that fortress without me. You think Sesisek could\u2019ve snuck you in? Please. The moment you entered, you would\u2019ve been detected. Sinthinia\u2019s got magic detection up the ass in that place. Fortunately I can mask your presence, just make sure you all stay invisible until the right time.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us, you just hold up your end and get us to Velzix, necromancer.\u201d\n\nYou make your trek back to Fury, without incident with your hidden friends in tow. You take a deep breath before entering the gates where upon you half expect the demon guards to stop you, but nothing happens. You\u2019ve succeeded. Your next move is to get as quickly as possible to Velzix\u2019s inner chambers.\n\nYou don\u2019t get far when an alarm is raised, you think it\u2019s for you at first, but you soon realize its Sesisek doing his part.

I expected this from Sesisek, but I thought you learned your place! No matter, you will learn pain instead, and your blood leech buddies won\u2019t be able to help you either!\u201d\n\nVelzix\u2019s portal opens and a swarm of demons come pouring out. The vampire assassins waste no time and begin their work with deadly efficiency.

You\u2019ve suffered a mortal wound, but it hardly matters now. Deep down you didn\u2019t expect to survive this. Velzix isn\u2019t either though. Sesisek arrives just in time to slam an axe in his back while he was finishing off the last vampire assassin.\n\nVelzix roars in pain, but falls to the floor where upon Sesisek pulls out a second weapon, a sword and severs his head from his body.\n\nIt\u2019s done.

He was something of a greater power in his own infernal plane once, but apparently lost most of it as power is often fleeting in such a place of constant struggle.\n\nStill, he refused to give up and was in the long slow process of rebuilding his status until the Dark Order summoned and bound him to your world. He was angry at first, which of course is natural for any demon (or anyone in captivity really) but soon he recognized this as an opportunity. A whole world he could take over and use to increase his own power. A place he could be complete master over after he made it more like home of course. He is making sure to make this plan becomes a reality.\n\nBesides being very intelligent and strong, he\u2019s also quite charismatic for a demon, which accounts for why he\u2019s managed to unite his brethren more successfully than most. Though of course in-fighting still occurs, it\u2019s kept in check for the most part.\n\nVelzix is definitely aware that most of his followers are secretly planning his downfall, he expects it in fact.

You might even say he treats you equal to his other high ranking demons rather than a mortal. (Though given how he treats his fellow demons that\u2019s not saying much) Most other mortals that serve him have sold their souls for power and slavishly worship him or are serving mainly out of fear whereas you have chosen to serve out of ruthless pragmatism and in some ways still follow your own path.\n\nThough following your own path to the point where it\u2019s interfering with his own, would be quite detrimental to your\u2026alliance.\n\n\nSinthinia is a succubus, she is sometimes Velzix\u2019s \u201cconsort\u201d, but such things as fidelity are not a trait known to demons, let alone a succubus.

He dislikes her intensely and hopes to get revenge on her one day. She finds this to be incredibly hilarious.\n\nAs with most of her kind she\u2019s a wily one and uses her sex appeal as weapon whenever possible. This sometimes leads her to be playful, especially with mortals who often know no better until the last fatal moment. Though she\u2019s quite capable of being brutally sadistic when she desires (Often at that last fatal moment). This playfulness has extended towards you sometimes, though her feelings towards you are a bit more of fascination rather than seduction. She has often said that for a moral you\u2019re one of the more \u201cinteresting\u201d ones, but due to your dedication to necromancy she finds your line of work to be \u201cunfun\u201d. This is likely due to the fact that she is a creature that exploits and thrives off of emotions and feelings. The dead don\u2019t have such weaknesses; therefore the dead are no fun.\n\nHowever as you are still alive, she perhaps thinks that you may be a little fun\u2026", "action_results": [null, null]}, {"action": "Tivadol and Sesisek", "result": "Tivadol is a typical \u201crank and file\u201d demon.

This is what makes him a good general.\n\nIt\u2019s also what makes him a threat to Velzix. Tivadol barely contains the fact that he wants to take over Velzix\u2019s position one day. This attitude is probably why he\u2019s put on the frontlines and leading the most dangerous attacks. If he wins Velzix gains more territory, if he dies, then that\u2019s good too!\n\nTivadol knows this of course and decided that he shall gain more respect in displaying that he\u2019s a battlefield general rather than an armchair one. Then when the time is right, he\u2019ll take Velzix\u2019s throne by storm. A simple and short sighted plan. One that will probably not come to pass as Velzix is too intelligent to be overthrown by a straightforward coup. Tivadol might be successful if he employed a little subterfuge, but he doesn\u2019t have the patience for it. This is another reason why Tivadol wants Sinthinia on his side (Besides her obvious physical qualities of course) since she could take care of such things. So far he\u2019s been unsuccessful in convincing her.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t respect Sesisek (Considers him to be a fool who allowed himself to lose his status and never liked him to begin with) and respects you even less. As you are a mortal, he doesn\u2019t even know why Velzix deals with you and sees this as a weakness in him. The fact that you have great power of the dead doesn\u2019t impress him. He just sees you as another weak mortal that will have to be crushed when he takes power sooner or later.\n\nAnd if he gets his way, sooner.\n\n\nSesisek is a very very bitter demon.

(Right hand would be inappropriate here) He had spies everywhere and dealt in secrets, blackmail and assassination. He made sure he didn\u2019t have to answer to anyone except Velzix, and if things had gone as planned he wouldn\u2019t have had to answer to him for too much longer either.\n\nHowever a succubus called Sinthinia came along and fucked up everything for him. All his plotting, planning, and doubling dealings all came to be meaningless thanks to her actions. He had no more clout after what happened, and to add further insult Velzix allowed him to live and do menial humiliating jobs. However, Sesisek\u2019s time in the infernal plane most likely still would\u2019ve been a short one as other demons would\u2019ve taken revenge for his past dealings; the only thing that saved him was the Dark Order summoning to your world. As a result he was given a slight reprieve and he\u2019s even gained some of his status back since Velzix does know him to be competent and the fact that Velzix needs all the help he can get right now to get a strong foothold on your world.\n\nHe\u2019s been given a military position to keep him out of the way and preoccupied (Much like Tivadol) but due to his brethren\u2019s intense lack of respect of him, he\u2019s only leading mortal troops. He can\u2019t stand mortals and could care less if they die by the thousands, he dislikes being a military leader, (He preferred the subtle approach to power) and on top of all this his mind is constantly plagued by thoughts of revenge. All of this means his success on the battlefield is mediocre at best. He does a good enough job to make it appear like he\u2019s still useful.\n\nHe hates Sinthinia for betraying him, but even more for the fact that she was so successful at it. He hates Velzix for continuing to humiliate him. He finds Tivadol to be an idiotic brute who doesn\u2019t know shit about real power. As for you, he doesn\u2019t particularly care about you at all, except he doesn\u2019t find you to be a threat since you\u2019re a mortal.

Technology such as gunpowder weapons and other things like steam engines exists to a limited degree. Only the rich nations such as the Zalan Empire can afford to place money in such experimental things.\n\nMost of the world is \u201ccivilized\u201d in that parts of it have governing bodies to rule it. Though large stretches of untamed land do exist and \u201ccivilization\u201d can be relative in the case of some nations. Many different races exist, though how they get along is another matter.\n\nThe landscape on your world is quite varied ranging from deserts, to grasslands, to snowy mountains. But as far as anyone knows, only one large mass exists on your world. Many sailors have attempted to find other possible land masses, but all attempts have yielded nothing. The oceans do not contain any known sentient creatures, though large sea serpents have been sighted in the deep ocean by a few sailors that have barely come back alive from their circumnavigation around the world.\n\nThe underground is home to some races, though not as many dwell down there as one might assume. Nor is it a place where evil lurks, (though it can be) the underground is merely another place where some choose to live. Nobody ever chooses to live too deep underground however as the deeper one goes the more unlivable and inhospitable it is to make into a home.\n\nThe skies are clear. At one time there were a few large floating fortresses in the clouds, but during the Dead War, powerful magic cast by the Great Lich Lord caused these to crash to the ground and kill millions. After such an occurrence, it was decided that the risk was too great to have that happen again.

You really should\u2019ve known better, half of those witches are lesbians anyway. That whole Mother Earth Goddess worship caters to the rug munching.

Typically such a wide spread pact would normally be dismissed and broken by one government at some point in time, but so great was the threat long ago that for the good of all living creatures this one treaty has ALWAYS been upheld.\n\nLong ago, there was a war called the Dead War. How it began exactly is unclear, but it was a time of great violence, chaos and horror. The very existence of life was nearly extinguished and it was only due to several heroes that the Great Lich Lord (His real name is lost to history) was finally defeated, putting an end to this threat.\n\nEver since those dark years, the art of Necromancy has been outlawed and any tome containing the teachings of it, destroyed. In the events of the undead being spotted, nearly no effort is spared to destroy such creatures. Most of the time such events are caused by simple magic leaks, or magical experiments that accidentally raise such undead creatures, but investigations are typically done, just to make sure there isn\u2019t a budding Necromancer at work.\n\n\u201cHigher\u201d forms of undead such as Vampires still exist, but as can be expected they have been forced to hide, most have been reduced to being little better than ghouls that live in a dark hole in the wilderness and constantly having to stay one step ahead of nosey adventurers.

During the middle of the Dead War, one cabal of wizards decided to risk all by making a pact with the infernal forces in exchange for their help to fight the undead. This plan was doomed from the beginning as demons have loyalty to no one save themselves. Eventually the demons managed to break their contract and most began to run amok killing everything. Oddly it was the Great Lich Lord himself that finally closed the demon portals as they interfered with his own plans of dominating the world.\n\nThere are few demons left in the world, most of them having been killed by both sides, but the ones that do exist only do so because of their own trickery and guile. Indeed, many have managed to worm their way into civilization and making themselves \u201cuseful\u201d and pointing out that \u201cthey\u201d were not the demons that betrayed the pact (For some reason every demon that still roams the world NEVER seems to be the one that betrayed anyone) While some may have integrated into society, nearly all still maintain their asshole disposition.

You were born of a union of an elven mother and a ruthless human marauder whose own ancestry probably has ogrish blood.\nHow they met was quite beautiful though. Your Dad was storming an elven castle and after putting several pointy ears to their deaths he came across your Mom who was being held in a special tower to ensure her purity for her eventual marriage to a High Elven Prince. She was raised and conditioned to be a perfect wife and even had spells infused into her being to forge a bond with her potential mate. Of course your Dad didn\u2019t know all that, he just saw a fine piece of elven ass and naturally after all that killing, your Dad was in the mood for some lovin\u2026\n\nNormally after such actions he most likely would\u2019ve killed her or passed her over to the rest of his men where upon one of them would\u2019ve killed her after they had their fun, but something unexpected occurred. Rotten ol\u2019 Dad fell in love, possibly for the first time in his life. The reasons are somewhat unclear, though you believe that it strongly has something to do with the magical aura of your mother\u2019s conditioning. (Which also explains why she stayed a bastard who had basically raped her and killed her family) Instead of killing her he felt like doing stupid stuff like being nice to her and giving her sparkly things of great monetary value. He even carried her carefully out of the burning castle.\n\nOf course this didn\u2019t go over too well with the usual bunch of cutthroats he hung around with at the time, and he was severely taunted, mocked and even challenged. All of that soon stopped though after he killed everyone and married your Mom. The Elven Prince she was originally supposed to marry actually breathed a sigh of relief when it was discovered, since as it turned out he thought girls were \u201cicky\u201d and it was only to be a political marriage in the first place.\n\nSoon your father found that he now had actual responsibilities beyond his own selfish pleasures. Not only did he now have a wife, he had a baby on the way. Your mother\u2019s influence was taking more of a hold on him as well. He agreed to give up his banditry and marauder ways, and instead became a mercenary in which he could at least somewhat legally justify any misdeeds he might be involved in. Your mother who had been sheltered for so long became enamored with city life, so they both moved into a nice house in the Zalan Empire where she became a school teacher for young children.\n\nSoon you were born and your father hoped that you might follow in his footsteps (At this point he was eager to show his \u201coffspring\u201d all the cool ways to kill people) but it was obvious that you took more after your mother even if not the talent.\n\nWhile your Dad might\u2019ve become a \u201cchanged man\u201d due to your Mom, he didn\u2019t change that much. You had to hear the verbal abuse and endure a lot of physical hardship (Such as him taking you out to the wilderness where he wanted you to learn how to survive for three day just wearing a loincloth!), before he finally \u201cgave up\u201d on making you into a warrior. Still, you probably did learn how to fight better than most wizards, but of course you\u2019re FAR from being a \u201creal\u201d wizard! Fortunately Dad wasn\u2019t at home for long stretches at a time since his mercenary work often kept him busy. You don\u2019t mind saying about how sometimes you wished he never came back at all! But the old bastard was just too damn tough to die. Even in that rarity when his entire companies have been killed, he\u2019d always somehow manage to come back more or less in one piece.\n\nThe man still can inspire fear in you, even though you\u2019ve moved away and are an adult now. He\u2019s the one mainly paying for your education, so it\u2019s probably good that\u2019s he\u2019s still alive despite his threats and past abuse.\n\nYour Mom of course is nicer, and fortunately did try to shelter you from some of your Dad\u2019s wrath. However she\u2019s been pushy in her own way. The moment your Dad gave up on you, she immediately stepped in and took over. From that point she was bound and determined to groom you to be that great wizard that she KNOWS you\u2019re going to be. Sometimes you wish she wouldn\u2019t place so much faith in you, because quite frankly you don\u2019t have that much aptitude and you don\u2019t understand how she can\u2019t see that, though you\u2019re guessing that she purposely ignores that little fact. In her mind, you\u2019re going to be a great wizard no matter what, so after high school you were to be sent to the Magic College in Nuro.\n\nBesides Mom and Dad, there\u2019s Sis who was born shortly after you were. Sis is your Dad\u2019s favorite. When it was apparent you weren\u2019t warrior material, he noticed how your younger sister would always watch you and he spar. So he threw a sword to her and told her to show him what she had. Of course being very young at the time, she could barely hold the weapon, but it was obvious genetics favored her as a warrior and had natural ability. He might\u2019ve even taken her on mission with him, but your Mom wasn\u2019t having that. She did of course in time hone her skills to a great degree. So much so that she would become the youngest candidate to ever join the Zalan Empire\u2019s Elite Guard. Though your Dad wasn\u2019t exactly ecstatic with that decision as he\u2019d much preferred her to be a mercenary like him, rather than a governmental \u201cpawn\u201d (as he believes) but he can respect the battle skill.\n\nAs for your relationship with her, she sometimes bullied you when she got a little more skilled with fighting techniques, though sometimes it really helped to have a warrior sister to have your back at times, like when you got jumped by some Orc youths who were attempting to rob you. She single handedly defeated them all using only her fists. Of course when you both got home SHE took your money anyway!

She was supposed to come with you to Nuro Magic College. You and she had such plans, but of course those died with her.
