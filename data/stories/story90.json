Acrid smoke from the campfires, piss and refuse from the latrines, sweat from the men.\n\n\nAnd fear. You smell that too.\n\n\nThese men have reason to be afraid. You have spent the last few months fighting King Harold's enemies, only to march double-time to confront his most dangerous yet; William of Normandy. His army is camped below, twelve thousand men strong, in comparison to your eight thousand. There is reason to be afraid. Are you afraid? No, you affirm decisively in your mind. You are not afraid. You are Lord Aethelwulf, The Lord In The North, King Harold's most trusted advisor, and the veteran of a hundred battles. Why should you be afraid of an army of ragtag Normans who come to die on your sword?\n\n\nShaking such doubts from your mind, you stride purposefully through the bustle of the camp, intent on checking on the forward defenses. A pair of giggling urchins weave nimbly around you and a staggering drunk lurches out in front of you, notices your sparkling chainmail armor and backs away, apologizing profusely. Striding onward towards the edge of the English camp you pass the watchful gaze of the sentries unchallenged and stand at the upper slope of the hill.\n\n\nYou are not alone. Another man sits on the hill, wreathed in the shadow of the setting sun. Drawing closer you recognize him as Acwellen, a minor lord, but stalwart fighter. His face is stone, his jaw grimly set and his eyes staring out at the horizon. Looking over his shoulder you see the black smoke smearing the red evening sky. In the distance the town of Hastings burns. In the blurry uncertainty of the setting sun, you cannot tell if the glisten at his eyes is tears or just the sparkle of dying sunlight. Acwellen's son, you remember, was put in command of Hasting's garrison.\n\n\nAbove the treeline you can just make out the crackle of flames.

One has undone his breeches and is calmly urinating in the direction of William's army. In short, of the seventy warriors under your command, not a single one looks concerned or frightened.\n\n\nThat makes you proud. Most of these men you trained since boyhood, and for many you serve as a father figure. When they stand beside you at a shieldwall you have absolute confidence in your safety. They would risk their lives to save yours, and you would do the same for any of them.\n\n\nYou only wish you could say the same for your fyrdmen. Nearly a hundred and fifty, and every single one looks terrified. You can hardly blame them. In the clash of a shieldwall, it is the fyrdmen who bear the brunt of the assault. To break a shieldwall, aiming for its weakest combatants is a common strategy. With Harold outnumbered to begin with, more fyrdmen than normal will be forced into the front ranks. The continued success of the English nation could well depend on their spirits.\n\n\nApproaching some of your men, who greet you amicably but respectfully, you instruct them to spread some of your ale reserves amongst the fyrd.

Some men just aren't capable of facing the sheer brutality of a shieldwall sober.\n\n\nSomeone calls your name. Turning, you see Harold waving to you from the midst of his group of Housecarls. He grins excitably, filled with the same mad energy that bubbles inside of you. His armor is expertly wrought, fine mail links that shine red under the ominous clouds. At his belt a gold-hilted sword rests in its sheath, and slung across his back is a heavy Daneaxe. His roundshield is thick and red, and is emblazoned with his personal banner; the Fighting Man. A symbol as legendary as King Harold himself, the Fighting Man depicts a golden warrior, wielding a Daneaxe and roundshield. His face is filled with the mad joy of battle, and under his watchful gaze the forces of England will stand against the Norman tide.\n\n\nMoving closer, Harold clasps your forearm with his free hand\n\n\n\"Ready?\"\n\n\nYou nod fiercely\n\n\n\"Always\"\n\n\nHe smiles, but for a moment you see a flicker of emotion cross his face.

Form a shieldwall!\"\n\n\nThe cry of \"shieldwall\" is taken up across the line, as men rush to the front, each shield overlapping with the one to the left, forming an impenetrable wall. In theory.

Enormous and red, they flap and flutter in the gentle morning breeze, snarling at the approaching Normans. Looking down the hill you watch the Norman advance.\n\n\nIt is simply incredible. At least a thousand horses have lined up at the base of the hill. Their riders wear good mail army, which glints in the light, and long blue Norman kite shields, which provide good full body protection, but are slower and less flexible than your English roundshields. For armaments they carry long lances and spears, as well as longswords. To protect their heads they wear the classic Norman helmets, conical and tall with comically long nasal plates.\n\n\nThe whole situation is laughable.

Well-\"\n\n\nHe fails to suppress a chuckle\n\n\n\"Let's hope they're slow learners!\"\n\n\nThe men around you laugh, and that laughter drifts up and down the shieldwall. The mood begins to lighten.

To your right, you watch one of King Harold's Housecarls fully behead a horse with his Daneaxe, mid-charge. Spurting blood, the headless beast collapses to the ground, and before its rider can regain his footing he meets a similar fate at the hands of the grisly Daneaxe. On the far left, a horse actually breaks through, the rider spearing a man through the neck and then creating an opening by hacking wildly with his sword. His act of valor is short-lived. The fyrdmen swarm the rider from all sides, butchering him with their axes and scythes. The breach in the line quickly closes.\n\n\nThe Norman horsemen who are still alive turn tail and ride their horses back down the hill.
