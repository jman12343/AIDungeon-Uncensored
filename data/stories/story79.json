Bah, what nonsense. Go back a few hours and it\u2019d be the most powerful position in the world. The Fire Nation rules almost the entire world now, but with her father deciding to make himself the Phoenix King, not the most creative title, it makes her nothing but an honorary\u2026 something. Honorary vassal?\n\nOh, I\u2019m letting my mind wander again. How foolish of me. I\u2019m raving like a madwoman. She\u2019ll banish the Fire Sages in a few moments before they could betray her. It all started with Mother. No, it started when Zuko betrayed her, stole all their mother\u2019s affection by simply being born. At least Father pretended to like her. Too bad he just dumped her off here when he no longer had a use for her. Helping him commit genocide against the Earth Kingdom would\u2019ve made some fun bonding moments.\n\nWhat\u2019s taking them so long anyway? Put the crown on my head!

The others all cuddle under the mother\u2019s wings.\n\nAzula rushes forward. Some of the turtle-ducks wake up when she arrives, but not her target. She plucks it out of the water. It squawks and bites her hand. She lights her hand on fire while still grasping it. She keeps the blaze cold enough to make it a painful death for the creature. When it stops struggling, she drops it in the water and flees.\n\nBlood drips down her pointer finger, but the elation of victory drowns any of the pain. Tomorrow, she will blame everything on Zuzu. Then, Mommy will forgive him because she loves him. Mommy will then forgive her since everything Azula had done before wasn\u2019t as bad a murder.\n\nWhen she reaches her bedroom, she wipes the few trickles of blood on her nightgown.

She giggles and some falls into his mouth.\n\nHe opens his eyes and groans.\n\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve dodged, dum-dum.\u201d\n\nHe rubs his forehead, brushing off some of the sand. \u201cThere\u2019s no honor in running away.\u201d And now he\u2019s talking about honor?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also no honor is being thunked by a rock. Firebenders break through flame, but our soldiers without bending must dodge.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a firebender.\u201d\n\n\u201cA really bad one.\u201d She pokes his side. Oddly, he hasn\u2019t tried to get away from her yet. \u201cMaybe you should act more like a soldier than a bender. Maybe try some swords?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo son of Sozin or any firebender would use swords.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich\u2019s why you should.\u201d\n\nZuzu stares at her, trying to read her expressions. He\u2019s trying to decide if she\u2019s insulting him or offering advice. Who says I can\u2019t do both? She can read others easier than she can read that awful old poetry Mother likes so much. Zuzu couldn\u2019t tell if she was sad if she was crying, not that she ever would.\n\n\u201cWhy are you still here, next to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me, big brother?\u201d\n\nHe cringes. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOuch. \u201cFine. You don\u2019t have to, but I\u2019ll always be on your side when we\u2019re in battle. Well, unless we\u2019re in an Agni Kai. I\u2019ll just beat you quickly instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a princess in battle for centuries, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I will. You can be my armor bearer or something.\u201d\n\nHis demeanor darkens. Ug, that sounds like Ty Lee and those auroras. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get to a battlefield. I\u2019d just get in the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich\u2019s why you should be my helper. That way, you\u2019d have a purpose.\u201d\n\nThey lie there on the beach until sunset. Neither wanted to leave, since both knew what\u2019d happen. They\u2019d revert to their normal ways. They\u2019d fight for their parent\u2019s attention. Azula would scheme.\n\nBoth were right. They didn\u2019t have a quiet moment for the rest of the trip. When they got home, they\u2019d either avoid the other of fight. Azula would come out on top. She had to. Only perfection can reach the throne, and she\u2019ll prove she\u2019s perfection incarnate.\n\nHowever, she didn\u2019t lie, not when making that promise. Even though their daily lives are like a battle against the other, on the real battlefield, she\u2019d be there for her brother. No matter how much she dislikes the dum-dum, she knows it\u2019s the duty of a royal to protect the weaker members of the family. But, that\u2019ll happen years from now, maybe a decade. The Fire Lord will probably be her tea-loving uncle by then.\n\nEven Azula with all her cunning could never predict that the battlefield will come so soon. It\u2019ll come charging towards Zuzu not from assassins or enemy soldiers. He\u2019ll be threatened by his family.", "action_results": [{"action": "7", "result": "Azula sits at the desk as the teacher tries to teach the class. The girl tilts her head. On second thought, that woman teaches the class but not the princess. She learned these things on her own by staring at Father\u2019s maps. Who wouldn\u2019t? Tragically, this is also the only class that is remotely interesting.\n\nOther firebending children go to military school or, at worst, a normal school. Alas, Azula has the double-edged sword called royalty. A fire nation princess must know the dullest of things. How does one brew tea? How to sit perfectly still while the men talk? Raising childing? To any other girl, this may be interesting, but Azula knows her destiny is far grander than being a Fire Lady or a princess of the court. She WILL be Fire Lord. Fire Lords don\u2019t need to know the steps of brewing tea. That\u2019s for her uncle and cousin.\n\nWhile keeping her eyes on the teacher, she studies her interesting classmates, the only ones worth noting, from her peripheral vision. Mai acts like the perfect lady. Her parents expect nothing less. At least it gives me control over her. What noble family would want their daughter to not associate with the only princess of the Fire Nation? What bored daughter of a noble family wouldn\u2019t want to have exciting times with a firebending prodigy? And be closer to Zuzu. Ew. What does she see in him?\n\nOn the other hand, Ty Lee bounces her leg up and down even as she sits. She looks almost as bored as Azula right now. Is she even capable of being still? She wouldn\u2019t make a good infiltrator, but she could be our distraction. That Chi blocking will be handy as well. Still, does she feel out of place? Like me? Every girl here is a noble, but I am the princess while Ty Lee is technically a commoner. A commoner from a rich family, but a peasant nonetheless. When I become Fire Lord, I will elevate her family to nobility.\n\nAzula nods. Is it unnecessarily nice? I believe so, but I will guarantee the loyalty of a family of Chi blockers. Why hasn\u2019t any Fire Lord possessed the intelligence to do that yet? Oh well, their loss will become my gain.\n\nShe waits diligently until class is over. Patience is a virtue of earthbenders, but even those savages can occasionally have a correct idea. They leave for lunch, which is another class. Here they learn to eat properly which is something Azula knows how to do. Mother made sure of that.\n\nAzula and her two followers sit away from the other girls and eat their meals. Their etiquette instructor occasionally walks by, but they are otherwise left alone. Ty Lee rambles about a cute boy she saw on the street. On the street? Ew. Also, cute boy? Ew.\n\nHer ears perk up. Always listening, she hears a very important word. Ozai. And, it\u2019s just Ozai, not the proper Prince Ozai. She focuses on that voice, and its conversation. It looks like two girls to their left. Aren\u2019t those the daughters of Uncle\u2019s\u2026 something. Is it Captains or Majors? Either way, their fathers are out on that overly long campaign.

Azula ends her blue flames. \u201cMai, Ty Lee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\nMai simply nods.\n\n\u201cWe have a mission to defend our nation\u2019s honor.\u201d She pauses for a moment before smirking. \u201cI know exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Murder Them", "result": "It takes three hours of waiting for the right moment, but Azula has achieved her goal.

Oblivious, as expected. She lights her hands on fire. Blue flames dances in her palm. Neither girl notices their impending, painful death. Too bad. There would\u2019ve been more of a challenge otherwise.\n\nWith each hand, she blasts the heads of both girls. The fire burns for only a moment before she snuffs her blue flames. One lets out a short gasp. The other falls without a sound. Too easy. The girl who just fell twitches on the ground but can\u2019t say anything. Her vocal cords must\u2019ve been burned.

Her vision grows dark. I won\u2019t let Father think I failed him. She looks at her blue flame one last time. It is pretty. Then, she puts all her remaining strength into burning herself. The pain lasts for just a moment until she feels nothing at all. Since Azula doesn\u2019t want Father to ever think she failed, maybe doing this will make it seem like some form of assassination where the princess and two hapless bystanders were killed.\n\nShe never does find out, but her plan works. The name \u201cPrincess Azula\u201d became a rallying call for Fire Nation soldiers as they battled against Water Tribe and Earth Nation. One of those two had to be the culprits, right?\n\nThe nation mourned their fallen princess. At the funeral, Azula\u2019s father had a stone-cold gaze. His tool was broken too early. Her mother shed tears, five to be exact even though two were just due to the smoke of incinerating the corpse. Zuzu did cry on that day. He cried that night. He cried that week.

Oblivious, as expected. Firebending would be preferable, but blue fire would be a giveaway. Instead, she uses her foot. And Mother complains how I always wear pants. With the utmost precision and flexibility, thanks to lessons from Mai and Ty Lee, she kicked the back of one girl\u2019s head. As she crumples, she kicks the other one as well. You can\u2019t do that in a skirt, Mother. You also wanted me to wear dainty shoes, not these wonderful boots Father gave me.\n\nBoth girls seem semi-conscious. Azula takes out her brooch.

Why let good food go to waste? Why not enjoy the moment? This must be like the battlefields. She imagines herself standing at the walls of Ba Sing Se at the break of dawn. Her troops and the enemy\u2019s glare at the other, waiting for one to make the strike to start the battle for the Earth Kingdom\u2019s mighty, walled capital.\n\nInstead of those dirty barbarians and patriots dressed in the finest armor, there\u2019s Mother and her son facing Father and herself.

He\u2019d make the worst of Fire Lords, especially during wartime. If he can\u2019t handle family drama, how could he handle the lives of our people? Stupid Mother. You twisted and pampered him until I\u2019m manlier than him. And I\u2019m not manly, at all. I\u2019m a ferocious princess.\n\nShe realizes everyone\u2019s eyes are on her. I was smiling, wasn\u2019t I? Okay, time to make that seem intentional.\n\n\u201cI was reading about different types of warfare today.\u201d She keeps her voice conversational, casual. It seems more out of place for this diner than a waterbender inside a volcano. Huh, would a waterbender die faster than a firebender? What about earthbenders since the volcano is part earth?\n\n\u201cAzula.\u201d Is it possible for Mother to say her name without sounding so critical? \u201cWhat kind of classes are you taking at the Girl\u2019s Academy? When I was there, they\u2019d never teach su-\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d The timing of her interruption was perfect, as intended. This way, Zuzu could still follow the conversation. \u201cI taught myself.\u201d She puffs out her chest.\n\n\u201cGood job.\u201d Father\u2019s voice is cold, but the tone, unlike the words, were intended for Mother. His glare seems too cold for such a powerful firebender.\n\nZuzu slinks further into his chair.\n\n\u201cI was trying to apply what I learned to Uncle\u2019s campaign in Ba Sing Se. The barbarians seem to be using a hybrid between conventional and attritional warfare.\u201d Attritional is a big word. Zuzu wouldn\u2019t know that one, would he? \u201cWhile it\u2019s purely defensive, they rely on their tested methods of combat. Mostly reigning down stones and dirt on our soldier\u2019s heads from those walls.\u201d One day, she\u2019ll see for herself if the walls are higher than some mountains as the legends and soldier\u2019s tales say. \u201cThat would make it conventional warfare, but their goals lines up with a war of attrition. They aren\u2019t going for a decisive victory. They want to wear down Uncle and his soldiers until they give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d Zuzu finally speaks.\n\nAzula shrugs. \u201cHe would if he ran out of tea. Speaking about our glorious Crown-Prince\u2026\u201d Was that too much sarcasm? \u201cUncle seems to be using conventional war for an attritional objective while also utilizing blockade warfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Father nods in approval. Mother sits still, like a prim and proper noble. Ug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nHer bold statement caused everyone to look at her. Father raised his eyebrows. Mother glared daggers at her. Zuzu acted as if she just insulted his hero. Well, I did just insult his hero.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to defend my statement. \u201cThe city has the farmlands between the outer and inner walls. It should be self-sustaining until the outer walls are breached. It\u2019s more as if Uncle is blockading the world from Ba Sing Se, not Ba Sing Se from the world.\u201d She straightens her posture. \u201cBut, we already know this. That means the enemy is not desperate yet, thus conventional warfare. Eventually, Uncle and his forces will breach the outer wall. The enemy will then become desperate and gain two advantages, only one I believe Uncle anticipates.\u201d\n\nFather appears amused. Mother seems angry at her daughter for insulting Uncle and for speaking about things a girl her age couldn\u2019t possibly understand. Yet, I understand anyway. Zuzu looks like he\u2019s paying attention to her, though he\u2019s unhappy with her critiques.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fighting inside the walls. Home advantage, more so than what Uncle has been experiences. Also, the population won\u2019t be happy with our presence. Uncle doesn\u2019t have the will to use violent population control. The only way to not get crushed by a falling boulder is to either dodge or smash. We can\u2019t retreat, so he can\u2019t dodge. He doesn\u2019t have to will to smash the people.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Uncle is too nice to be a competent Fire Lord.\n\n\u201cThen, we have the problem Uncle won\u2019t expect. The Earth Kingdom is known for doing the same thing, patience and consistency. All that stuff. He\u2019ll expect them to use conventional war.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMother, if Water Tribe barbarians raided the palace and would possibly kill Zuzu, would you use honorable warfare or do anything possible to protect him?\u201d\n\nMother\u2019s eyes opened a little. She expected me to not involve her in my analysis. \u201cA mother would do anything to protect her son.\u201d\n\nAzula forces herself not to wince. A mother would do anything to protect her CHILDREN. \u201cThe barbarians will do the same. Urban guerilla warfare. It\u2019s be nasty, too nasty for Uncle or any of our commanders.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMaybe Zhao. Definitely me or Father. When we need to push just month longer to conquer the city, Uncle will leave. After all, Lu Ten fights on the front lines.\u201d\n\nMother stands up and leaves without a word. Zuzu looks between mommy dearest and the rest of his family. Then, he follows her out of the room.\n\n\u201cInteresting assessment, Azula.\u201d Father takes a bite of his food. \u201cMight I suggest another scroll to read?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is one of my favorites.

With my brother\u2019s retreat and desertion following the death of my nephew, no one knows if or when he shall return. However, I am here, Father, and my children are alive. Let your humble servant ensure your bloodline will continue on the throne.\u201d He bows before the old man.\n\nIn one day, will Father pass both Lu Ten and Uncle for his place on the throne?\n\n\u201cFool!\u201d Father miscalculated. The flames around the throne rise to the ceiling from the old man\u2019s fury. She holds Zuzu\u2019s hand. If not, he\u2019d flee in fear.\n\u201cYou dare wish to punish Iroh further? He lost his son! My son has suffered enough, but your suffering has just begun for your arrogance.\u201d\n\nZuzu breaks free of her grasp and flees.

Maybe I could act like I was trying to kill him?\n\n\u201cAzula.\u201d Fate must be on Father\u2019s side. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m saving your son, Mother. \u201cTalking.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d The tone and the tight grip on her arm don\u2019t allow for protests.\n\nAs she drags Azula out of the room, she hears Zuzu muttering, \u201cAzula always lies.\u201d\n\nThat HURT. She doesn\u2019t struggle at all as she\u2019s practically dragged through the halls. I\u2019m the only person in the bloody world that\u2019s trying to save Zuzu, but you\u2019ve entrenched your ideas so far into his head that he refuses to believe me. You aren\u2019t good for him, Mother. You aren\u2019t good for anybody. Father\u2019s going to kill him, but you\u2019re the one who made him weak enough to kill. I wish you were gone. I wish you were dead.\n\nHer eyes light up. Dead. Gone. She sees a new opportunity. It\u2019d kill two birds\u2026 four birds with one stone. Father would be so proud if she could ever tell him. Too bad she can\u2019t and won\u2019t.\n\nThey stop in Mother\u2019s chambers. She stopped sleeping with father two years ago. Also, ew.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing, Azula?\u201d And she thinks I\u2019m the baddy here.\n\n\u201cYou once said you\u2019d do anything if barbarians wanted to kill Zuzu.\u201d\n\nHer eyes narrow. For once, Mother looks dangerous. Maybe I inherited a few things from her, besides beauty, after all. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d Her grip on the girl\u2019s shoulder becomes painful. Maybe, it\u2019ll leave a bruise.\n\u201cFather\u2019s going to kill Zuzu tonight because the Fire Lord asked him to.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cTell me one reason why I should believe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour. Zuzu won\u2019t die. The Fire Lord will die. Father will get the throne, and you will be gone forever.\u201d\n\nHer shoulders slouch. I don\u2019t always lie. I\u2019m occasionally nice. More importantly, sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie.\n\n\u201cYou have a plan, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Azula smirks.\n\nLater that night, the palace erupts into chaos. Azula stands watch in the shadows outside Zuzu\u2019s door. He sleeps, blissfully unaware of the subterfuge and murder that just occurred. No matter what happens, she will not let anyone into his room tonight. Well, except that one. A figure gracefully approaches his bedroom. Unaware of the hidden prodigy, Mother rushes into his room. She shakes him gently.\n\n\u201cWha? Mother?\u201d He rubs his eyes. None of the guards are aware of the woman in his room. Father happened to ensure no one was around his son\u2019s bedroom tonight. Too late, Father. We spilt blood before you could.\n\n\u201cZuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you.\u201d She wraps his in a tight embrace. She loves you, brother. Now, she\u2019ll never see you again. \u201cRemember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.\u201d\n\nBefore he could say anything in reply, she leaves. To where, Azula doesn\u2019t know.

Ty Lee and Mai don\u2019t criticize her. Father would praise her for having the guts to take a life. He killed every man who faced him in an Agni Kai, all twelve of them. Zuzu... What would her brother do?\n\nAs if Agni wanted to answer her question, Zuzu suddenly sat beside her. Azula squints, since Zuzu\u2019s head lines up with the setting red sun, Agni\u2019s presence in their world. She notices her heartrate increases. Why? The realization dawns on her. Mother saw me as a monster after I killed that baby turtle-duck.

Father had increased Azula\u2019s training to more intense levels ever since his ascension to the throne. School drags by during the day. Firebending training comes at evening. She falls asleep every night reading scrolls about strategy and the human mind. Every morning, she practices her aim and agility. It hasn\u2019t killed me yet, and there were so many chances during the firebending. I\u2019m not dead, just stronger.\n\nZuzu picks up the dead turtle-duck mother from the pond and places it at Azula feet. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hisses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Fire Nation. We don\u2019t let corpses rot or throw them to sea like the Water Tribe or burry them like the Earth Kingdom. This animal was Fire Nation.\u201d\n\nShe tilts her head.

There\u2019s a reason why no one talks about her. A good Fire Lord would never let personal loss cloud her judgment.\u201d\n\nShe clenches her fists. The remaining turtle-ducklings won\u2019t stop fussing. They continuously call out their high-pitched squeaks for a mother that will never come back to them. Their mother abandoned them.

She notices how her stands of hair fall out of place more commonly, but that doesn\u2019t bother her now. She lets her movements flow into the next with savage punching followed by wild kicking. Each time, blue flames come out and hit the target.\n\nIt hardly registers with her that it became dark outside. Firebenders draw their power from the sun, so they lose some of their power after the sun no longer gives its light. However, Azula\u2019s fire hasn\u2019t diminished, for each fireball has only increased her\u2026 confusion.\n\nI don\u2019t feel anything!\n\nHer heart aches for her brother.

Zuzu loves her because she is Azula.\n\nI\u2019m not sad!\n\nHer hands twitch on their own accord.

Fear of loosing her kin.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid.\n\nHer lips twist into a ferocious snarl that would make the most battle-hardened men squirm. Her blood boils as if her fire has roasted it. She feels fury, rage. No one will save Zuzu, so he will die. He will lie all night being tended by their uncle. In the morning, he will realize his mistake and try to secure passage out, but he will be moments too slow. Her father will ensure Uncle Iroh will be too slow, so he can kill Zuzu.\n\nFine.

There never was much point to buying things when anyone would gift or give them to her instead. Putting more money in a bag than most peasants would see in twenty lifetimes, she slinks through the back passageways to the infirmary. Zuzu and I used to explore these.

I\u2019m definitely not.\n\nShe creeps through the doorway and spies only two figures. One slouches in a chair. His breathing patterns suggest he fell asleep or meditates. Knowing him, the latter. The other lies in a bed with a bandage covering the entire left side of his face. Will Zuzu be half-blind?\n\n\u201cHave you come to gloat, my niece?\u201d Uncle raises his head from his meditation. Azula forces herself not to shake her head. Why does everyone always assume the worst about me? Oh, right. I\u2019m a monster. I always lie. Thanks for nothing, Mother. Thanks for never bothering to love me.\n\nInstead of arguing, she hands her uncle the bag of coins without a word.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He squints, trying to read the symbols without adequate lighting.\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cSince you probably wasted all your funds of tea, here\u2019s something to ensure you don\u2019t kill my brother immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite popular opinion, I find breathing brothers as more useful than dead ones.\u201d She glances at Zuzu. \u201cI may not see him for a long time. Tell him he better be able to bend at least pathetically bad instead of horrifically bad.\u201d\n\nAzula takes one more look at her brother and memorizes the sight. She sears it into her memory. Will she even recognize him next time they meet? Probably not. He won\u2019t recognize her either. She will be wearing the regalia of Fire Lord as she welcomes back her brother from exile.

Azula must scheme ways to get her brother back.\n\nShe came up with a simple plan. She would give a rousing speech to the traitorous police. Why are they called Dai Li anyway? All she then had to do was organize a simultaneous coup where all five Earth Kingdom generals were captured, use the police to break down the wall with earthbending, and request Zuzu and Uncle\u2019s presence for some believable reason. To anyone but Azula, this would be too difficult, but she\u2019s the perfect princess of the Fire Nation. She couldn\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t fail.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t stop laughing when she learned what her brother and uncle were up to. They were small business owners. They owned a tea shop! The \u201cgreat\u201d general Iroh and the prince of the Fire Nation were serving tea to the snobbish high-born barbarians of the Earth Kingdom. In that case, she sent them a letter claiming the Earth King, who was nothing but the police\u2019s moronic and unsuspecting puppet, wanted them to serve tea just before sundown. Zuzu is more gullible than a toddler and Uncle would be glad to have such a \u201cpowerful\u201d person request his tea.\n\nAll she then had to do was wait. She\u2019d convince her brother to join her, the city will fall, and the two of them will wait for the Avatar to return. He doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of boy who\u2019d leave behind a member of his entourage.\n\nThat\u2019s when things went wrong. If someone surrounded Azula with the police force and started talking to her, she\u2019d stall and see what they want. Zuzu and Uncle ran before her brother\u2019s honor got in the way. He stopped an challenged her to an Agni Kai. Since she didn\u2019t feel like burning and embarrassing him, she told her Dai Li to capture him. They placed him with the waterbender in an underground cave. An odd place for a prison cell, but these people are barbarians.\n\nNow, she waits for the Avatar. She can reason with Zuzu once he calms down. Who knows? Maybe he and the waterbender could get to know each other. No Fire Lord could ever have a waterbender as a wife or concubine, and that\u2019d guarantee Azula\u2019s status as the next Fire Lord. Father will be so proud.\n\nThey do the coup. Everyone gets captured as planned. The leader of the police tries to double-cross her, but the police have more sense than their leader. Would execution or life imprisonment be better? She smiles. Maybe I could let the peasants of this city decide. I get rid of him and gain loyalty.\n\nOh, the earthbending teacher and the boomerang idiot also showed up during the coup. They\u2019re in a cell with the Earth King now.\n\nThat means only Iroh and the Avatar are unaccounted for. Azula sighs. Knowing Uncle\u2019s lack of patriotism these days and the Avatar\u2019s boyish gullibility, I\u2019d suspect they\u2019re looking for Zuzu and that waterbender together.\n\nShe and her police head down to the underground prison. She left Ty Lee and Mai behind. Things could get ugly, so she wanted only expendable minions this time.\n\nShe sees all four of them. They aren\u2019t fighting. They\u2019re just\u2026 talking.

He gave up on his quest to capture the Avatar, and now he joined forces with the boy.\n\nZuzu betrayed me!\n\nShe should tell the police to ambush the four, but rage clouds her judgement. She swoops down and fires lightning at the four. Uncle takes the blast and redirects it back to her police.\n\n\u201cAzula!\u201d Instead of fighting, her brother grabs both the Avatar and the waterbender and drags them away. Uncle fires blast after blast at her. She stays on the offensive, but firebending power runs in the family. Well, Zuzu is the exception.\n\nSeeing the three run away, she fires another blast of lightning at them. I might not be able to give much more. Zuzu doesn\u2019t see it in time. You fool! You weren\u2019t supposed to get hit! The Avatar does notice the cold, electric flame. He pushes her brother out of the way. Thunder erupts as the boy\u2019s body falls limp. The waterbender screams in anguish. Zuzu stands there like a dum-dum.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d Azula is forced to put all her attention on Uncle. He fights with a renowned fury. \u201cI\u2019ll hold them off! Get the Avatar out of here. Be safe, my nephew!\u201d\n\nZuzu nods with tears in his eyes. He slings the boy over his shoulder and drags off the waterbender with his other. Bye Zuzu. Uncle fights only long enough to hold off Azula and the police. Of course, the police only regathered themselves at the end of the battle, unable to regain their nerve after a few were fried when Uncle redirected lighting at them. Wimps.\n\nHe holds up his hands. \u201cI surrender.\u201d\n\nAzula strides up to Uncle with blue flames in her hand. The police earthbend the terrain around the aging man until only his face can be seen. She raises her hand to burn off the enemy\u2019s face but stops herself for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhy, Uncle? Why did you make Zuzu join the Avatar?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did no such thing.\u201d\n\nShe moves her hand closer but not close enough to hurt him. \u201cZuzu loved me, but now he joined the Fire Nation\u2019s enemy. That doesn\u2019t happen without manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, but his head doesn\u2019t move much in his earthen encasing. \u201cYou did that Azula. Your brother was tired of chasing the Avatar, but not one part of his heart wished to join them. You were the one who did that. You forced him to.\u201d\n\nAzula turns her face away from Uncle to hide her cringe. Stupid! How could I be so stupid?\n\n\u201cTake him away. I don\u2019t want to see his face again,\u201d she says to the police. They nod wordlessly. She walks away, eager to leave this cavern of sorrows.\n\n\u201cAzula.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou said Zuko loved you. That is not entirely true, since I\u2019m sure he still loves you.\u201d\n\nShe breaks into a run.", "action_results": [{"action": "15", "result": "\u201cZuzu.\u201d\n\nAfter everything that happened to her in those fifteen years, it all comes down to this moment.\n\nThere he stands. Behind him, there\u2019s the waterbending girl. The Avatar didn\u2019t die. He attacked the capital during an eclipse. They couldn\u2019t bend. Only a dishonorable enemy would do that, but the Fire Nation repelled their attack.\n\nWhy! Why does Zuzu fight with the Avatar? He betrayed her! She wanted him to come home, but he sided with the Fire Nation\u2019s greatest enemy. Why? She knows why. MOTHER. It\u2019s her fault! It\u2019s not Azula\u2019s fault. Mother was the one who poisoned his mind ever since his birth. After she had to leave, Uncle continued. They turned Zuzu away. He even became the Avatar\u2019s firebending teacher! WHY!\n\nThen, Mai betrayed her. She did it so Zuzu could\u2019ve escaped. He was in her clutches! Azula was going to subdue her, then Ty Lee attacked her. WHY! It doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t compute. The world\u2026 the world doesn\u2019t work this way. She\u2019s Azula. She doesn\u2019t fail.\n\nThen, Father left her behind to kill a bunch of Earth Kingdom civilians. He didn\u2019t see her as useful anymore. Why would? Everyone betrays her, so he discarded her like a used concubine. Why must everyone betray her!\n\nShe knows why. Mother was right. This entire time, she was right. I\u2019m a monster. It simply took Zuzu longer to realize it.\n\n\u201cSorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.\u201d He lights his hands on fire. \u201cI am. I challenge you to an Agni Kai. You tried to kill me too many times already. Let\u2019s settle everything right here, right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in her life, she tries to truly injure her brother. She tried to hurt him countless times, but never did she want to cause so much damage. He fights backs using forms she never saw before, but the girl hardly recognizes anything. She focuses on trying to burn him, hurt him.\n\nWhy can't it all be better, when we were young? It was nice then. He didn\u2019t think I was a monster.\n\nShe did so much for him. He said she was his sister. LIER! He knows she\u2019s a monster. Monsters don\u2019t have brothers. Monsters don\u2019t have joy. They don\u2019t have friends or happy ending. Monsters have pain, and they give pain. That\u2019s it.\n\nWhy is everything on fire? Oh, I forgot. Today is Sozin\u2019s Comet! That\u2019s why Daddy\u2019s killing people and babies. Last time this came, my great-grandfather killed every airbender except the Avatar. Daddy\u2019s just gonna use this to kill more people! Why\u2019d I forget that?\n\nSome part of her mind tells her something inside is wrong. She\u2019s breaking, slipping. She ignores that voice.\n\nTheir flames are more like tornadoes. The palace, the courtyard, everything. There\u2019s fire everywhere. It\u2019s so hot. She uses her flames to propel her. Maneuverability is\u2026 good? Tactical. It\u2019s tactical for fights. Daddy says so.\n\nThen, Zuzu throws a really big fireball at her. She keeps it from burning her, but she falls on the ground. That hurt. Zuzu hurt me!\n\n\u201cNo lightning today? What's the matter?\u201d He sounds angry. Why is Zuzu angry with me?\n\nTwo little voices in the back of her head tell her not to fire. One says he\u2019s her big brother, and she shouldn\u2019t hurt her big brother. Mommy wouldn\u2019t want that. The other one, one that has been getting quieter and quieter, tells he\u2019s planning something. He wouldn\u2019t taunt her into using her lightning unless he had a good reason.\n\nShe ignores both. She tries to clear all feelings, but she can\u2019t. The lightning comes anyway, not because she\u2019s amazing or perfect. She isn\u2019t amazing; she isn\u2019t perfect. The comet merely provides her with enough power. The lightning seems to be burning through her body, her mind, and her soul. Pain. So much pain.\n\nThen, she sees the waterbender. She\u2019s close enough to be in the courtyard. Agni Kai\u2019s are for two fighters, but that girl stepped into the courtyard. It\u2019s a technicality but a victory. Azula won by default because Zuzu had an ally step into the dueling grounds.\n\nI still want to hurt Zuzu.\n\nShe fires at her brother. He outstretches his hand as the lightning sink into his palm. He should be dead, an instantaneous death. Instead, the lightning seems to move through him for a moment. He raises his other hand and the lightning comes back out. Uncle taught him how to redirect lightning.\n\nA great heat bites at her feet. An explosion rips through her ears before silence deafens her. For a moment, she feels wind blowing past her. No, she blows past the wind. The lightning hits the ground, and it launched her across the battlefield. She hits the stone ground with a crash. Her chest tightens. She doesn\u2019t get up. She can\u2019t get up. Instead, the girl spasms on the ground.\n\n\u201cAzula!\u201d\n\nHer vision darkens, but she sees her brother run towards her.\n\n\u201cZuko, what are you doing?\u201d It\u2019s that waterbender. She looks unhappy, unlike Zuzu. He looks scared.\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t getting up!\u201d He kneels beside her, but she doesn\u2019t stop him. She can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have a heartbeat, do I? He presses his hand on her chest for a moment. \u201cNo heartbeat! Azula will die!\u201d\n\nWasn\u2019t that the point of this fight, dum-dum?\n\nHe cries and holds her hand. What a baby. \u201cKatara! Can you save her?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t restart a heart. Maybe shock her again?\u201d But Zuzu can\u2019t do lightning. He\u2019d need perfect emotional control. Ha! As if. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point though? This\u2019s Azula.\u201d Azula the monster.\n\nHe shakes his head and stands. \u201cI\u2019m saving her because she\u2019s Azula.\u201d\n\nAs her vision fades, she sees him waive his arms in circular motions. My big brother is trying to bend lightning as he\u2019s crying? If she wasn\u2019t dying, she\u2019d be laughing at his stupidity. The dum-dum can\u2019t generate lightning when he\u2019s crying. Right now, he\u2019s anything but emotionally stable.\n\nAzula\u2019s body convulses again from the shock. The tension from her chest goes away and her vision returns. The first thing she sees is Zuzu with the last traces of electricity fading away from his fingertips. He bent lightning for me?\n\nHe picks her up in his arms. \u201cKatara, she needs healing. I know where there\u2019s water.\u201d Oh, she\u2019s a waterbender and a waterhealer. He runs and takes deep breathes.\n\nHer body lies limp in his arms. Everything tingles and aches. Using all her fleeting strength, she asks a single question. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my sister.\u201d\n\nNo, I\u2019m an evil, scary monster. Even as a child, I was unlovable.

She burnt one of them just once, and now they\u2019re almost as scared as the princess.\n\n\u201cAzula.\u201d\n\nTHAT isn\u2019t Mother. She looks up, bleary from hitting her head so hard.

The waterbender puts up a noble fight, but the girl is a minute away from defeat. Exhaustion will take her.\n\nThe Avatar proceeds to bend then hide inside a dome of rocks and crystal. The waterbender fights out of desperation. Why would he abandon her? The Avatar State\u2026 No!\n\nAzula runs to where she\u2019d expect to see the back of the Avatar when he comes out. He\u2019s entering the Avatar State. I could probably survive, but Zuzu\u2026 She narrows her eyes. You aren\u2019t going to take Zuzu from me.\n\nShe swirls her hands around and clears any feelings from her mind. Electricity cackles from her fingertips.\n\nThe Avatar rises from his earthen shelter with his eyes glowing white. He\u2019s about to unleash death and destruction on his enemies. Azula points and fires. The lightning strikes his back, and he falls to the ground. The waterbender screams and unleashes a wave of water sweeping up his body.\n\nZuzu and Azula step towards her. Just give us the body, girl.\n\nA blast of fire forces them to jump back. \u201cYou've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can!\u201d Uncle\u2019s words seem to tear through Zuzu\u2019s heart. The police, Zuzu, and Azula all fight Uncle, but he is one of two firebenders Azula couldn\u2019t easily destroy in combat. The moment the waterbender leaves, the old man stops fighting and holds out his hands in surrender. The police take him away without a word.\n\nAzula takes Zuzu away from the cave. It seems to be killing him on the inside. She leads him to the Earth King\u2019s throne, and not once does he ask her to stop. Azula smiles as she sits on the throne. Zuzu looks broody. It\u2019s time to cheer him up.\n\n\u201cZuzu, we\u2019ve done it. The war is over. The Avatar is defeated. You can go home, with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI betrayed Uncle.\u201d\n\nShe stand and walks to him. She pokes him in the chest forcibly. \u201cYou. Did. Not. Were you the one to throw fire at him first? Were you the one who wanted to help the Avatar, the very person who\u2019d rip down everting we and our ancestors worked for? Uncle betrayed you. I didn\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have the Avatar. What if Father doesn\u2019t accept it? What if he doesn\u2019t restore my honor?\u201d\n\nShe puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to, Zuzu. Today, you restored your own honor.\u201d\n\nShe looks at him for a moment longer. Then, she does something she never did before. She wraps her arms around him and pulls him into a hug.\n\n\u201cWelcome home, Zuzu.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "15", "result": "\u201cZuzu.\u201d\n\nAfter everything that happened to her in those fifteen years, it all comes down to this moment.\n\nThere he stands. Behind him, there\u2019s the waterbending girl. The Avatar didn\u2019t die. He attacked the capital during an eclipse. They couldn\u2019t bend. Only a dishonorable enemy would do that, but the Fire Nation repelled their attack.\n\nWhy! Why did Zuzu chose to leave them? He betrayed her! They were getting along! Even he and Mai were getting all lovey-dovey. Ew. He left. Why? She knows why. MOTHER. It\u2019s her fault! She was the one who poisoned his mind ever since his birth. After she had to leave, Uncle continued. They turned Zuzu away. He even became the Avatar\u2019s firebending teacher! WHY!\n\nThen, Mai betrayed her. She did it so Zuzu could\u2019ve escaped. He was in her clutches! Azula was going to subdue her, then Ty Lee attacked her. WHY! It doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t compute. The world\u2026 the world doesn\u2019t work this way. She\u2019s Azula. She doesn\u2019t fail.\n\nThen, Father left her behind to kill a bunch of Earth Kingdom civilians. He didn\u2019t see her as useful anymore. Why would? Everyone betrays her, so he discarded her like a used concubine. Why must everyone betray her!\n\nShe knows why. Mother was right. This entire time, she was right. I\u2019m a monster. It simply took Zuzu longer to realize it.\n\n\u201cSorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.\u201d He lights his hands on fire. \u201cI am. I challenge you to an Agni Kai.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in her life, she tries to injure her brother. He fights backs using forms she never saw before, but the girl hardly recognizes anything. She focuses on trying to burn him, hurt him.\n\nWhy can't it all be better, when we were young? It was nice then. He didn\u2019t think I was a monster.\n\nShe did so much for him. He said she was his sister. LIER! He knows she\u2019s a monster. Monsters don\u2019t have brothers. Monsters don\u2019t have joy. They don\u2019t have friends or happy ending. Monsters have pain, and they give pain. That\u2019s it.\n\nWhy is everything on fire? Oh, I forgot. Today is Sozin\u2019s Comet! That\u2019s why Daddy\u2019s killing people and babies. Last time this came, my great-grandfather killed every airbender except the Avatar. Daddy\u2019s just gonna use this to kill more people! Why\u2019d I forget that?\n\nSome part of her mind tells her something inside is wrong. She\u2019s breaking, slipping. She ignores that voice.\n\nTheir flames are more like tornadoes. The palace, the courtyard, everything. There\u2019s fire everywhere. It\u2019s so hot. She uses her flames to propel her. Maneuverability is\u2026 good? Tactical. It\u2019s tactical for fights. Daddy says so.\n\nThen, Zuzu throws a really big fireball at her. She keeps it from burning her, but she falls on the ground. That hurt. Zuzu hurt me!\n\n\u201cNo lightning today? What's the matter? Afraid I'll redirect it?\u201d He sounds angry. Why is Zuzu angry with me?\n\nTwo little voices in the back of her head tell her not to fire. One says he\u2019s her big brother, and she shouldn\u2019t hurt her big brother. Mommy wouldn\u2019t want that. The other one, one that has been getting quieter and quieter, tells her there\u2019d be no tactical advantage. Her brother can redirect lightning, so he\u2019d fire it back at her.\n\nShe ignores both. She tries to clear all feelings, but she can\u2019t. The lightning comes anyway, not because she\u2019s amazing or perfect. She isn\u2019t amazing; she isn\u2019t perfect. The comet merely provides her with enough power. The lightning seems to be burning through her body, her mind, and her soul. Pain. So much pain.\n\nThen, she sees the waterbender. She\u2019s close enough to be in the courtyard. Agni Kai\u2019s are for two fighters, but that girl stepped into the courtyard. It\u2019s a technicality but a victory. Azula won by default because Zuzu had an ally step into the dueling grounds.\n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt Zuzu now.\n\nShe fires at the girl instead.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Zuzu dives in front of the lightning bolt. He must\u2019ve realized she was firing at his friend. No fair. He gets all the friends.\n\nThe lightning hits him in the chest. He redirects some of it, but not all. He convulses on the floor dying before her eyes. It\u2019s just like that moment four years ago when Daddy burnt off part of Zuzu\u2019s face.\n\nI killed Zuzu! I KILLED ZUZU! I\u2019m a monster! I killed him!\n\nWitch! Water witch! You tricked me into killing Zuzu!\n\nShe chases the girl. She throws fire. She says\u2026 things. She doesn\u2019t know what the words are, only her mouth moves and sound comes out. Nothing else matters. The waterbender must die because Zuzu will die.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, Zuzu! Mommy was right. I\u2019m a monster, and I killed you!\n\nThe enemy hides behind pillars and slides on her ramps of ice. Azula chases. She won\u2019t fail. The girl stops moving under a covered walkway. Every tactical part of Azula\u2019s mind tells her to stop. That girl must be planning something. She doesn\u2019t listen. Zuzu needs to be avenged.\n\n\u201cThere you are, filthy peasant!\u201d She raises her hand to burn off the witch\u2019s pretty face. Then, everything becomes ice cold. She can\u2019t move.\n\nLooking down, she sees the water below them, a small canal running under their feet. They\u2019re standing on a grated covering. The waterbender lifted the water up and froze it.\n\nThe witch melts the water around herself. She takes a chain and wraps it around Azula\u2019s hands. Then, she ties it to the floor. She chained her like a wild animal, like a monster. She melts all the ice. Azula drops to the floor.\n\nShe\u2019s alone. Zuzu\u2019s dead. Father doesn\u2019t love her. She doesn\u2019t have any friends.\n\nAzula breathes out fire trying to burn everything like the monster she is. She tugs at the chains to free herself. It won\u2019t budge. She falls on her back. Her head smack against the stone floor, but it doesn\u2019t matter. No one loves her. I killed Zuzu.\n\nShe cries. She wails like a little girl. Mommy! Mommy! Come back! Save Zuzu! You love him, so save him. Give\u2026 Give him a kiss! That would make it feel all better. Mommy, please. Save Zuzu from me.\n\nThrough her tears, she sees two figures standing, staring at her. Zuzu? She blinks a few times. The figures come into focus.\n\n\u201cZuzu!\u201d she screams. \u201cYou\u2019re all better!\u201d\n\nThe wound on his chest is gone! Why hasn\u2019t her tears stopped?\n\n\u201cStay away from me, Zuzu! Stay away! Mommy was right. I\u2019ll hurt you again. I\u2019m a monster!\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Never Hurt Zuzu Again", "result": "Azula sits in the dark room. It\u2019s scary. I\u2019m old. I\u2019m not supposed to fear the dark. It scares her anyway. She could light a candle or open the curtains, but the fire scares her too. What if she knocked over the candle and burnt something? What if she couldn\u2019t stop the fire from her hands?\n\nShe hears muffled voices growing louder as they walk by. Then, the voices drift father and father away. Some fear her. Others pity her. Azula just wants to be their friends. The doctors said she got better. What was it that was wrong with me? She clutches her head. Sometimes, bright lights or sharp noises hurt her head so much. It makes her want to cry, but she won\u2019t cry. Not anymore. She\u2019s a big girl now, and Mother never cried.\n\nOne day, she\u2019s going to be helpful. Zuzu has been the best older brother ever. Every week, he visited her in her special room. No one else did that. Mai saw her a few times. Ty Lee would do it most weeks. Zuzu never missed her once. It makes her feel happy. He forgave her, so she wants to help him. She wants to be a good little sister.\n\nShe remembers things about the courts. The doctors said she kept her cunning mind. Maybe Zuzu could use her as an advisor? He is such a good Fire Lord. All the kingdoms like him too because he\u2019s nice to them. For a hundred years, the Fire Nation attacked the other countries. Zuzu stopped it because he didn\u2019t want anyone else hurt.\n\nAzula nods. Zuzu is smart, so that is a good idea. Not hurting people is good. She killed only one man in the last month after all. Just one! It made her cry, but no one can know that. She must be a big girl. He wanted to hurt Zuzu when her dum-dum was visiting her. Azula knows Mother would\u2019ve protected Zuzu, so she blasted him apart with lighting. It was so scary. She didn\u2019t know she could still do that, but Zuzu said she shouldn\u2019t do it for fun. Like fire, lightning hurts people if she isn\u2019t careful, but that man wanted to kill Zuzu. She will hurt anyone who wants to hurt him.\n\nNow, Azula decided she\u2019ll be the most careful bender ever. She doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, even the bad people. Still, Zuzu can never be hurt. She will do anything for him.\n\nThe door opens.\n\nAzula smiles. \u201cZuzu! I missed you!\u201d\n\nHe smiles back to her. He wears the robes of the Fire Lord and the crown too. It makes him look so strong. \u201cYou can see me any time. I told you exploring is fine if you stay with the guards.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d She points outside. \u201cWhat if a bad man tries to hurt me or if I lose control? I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. Never again, but I know I will if he wants to hurt you. If I stay in here, then even the bad men are safe from me.\u201d\n\nHe extends his hand. \u201cWanna take a walk? Just me and you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d\n\nShe wraps her arm around his elbow. Together, they leave her room and walk through the palace. She waives at the people even if they look afraid. Zuzu said being nice to people is good, so she will be nice to them. She remembers all these halls. She ran down them when she was a little girl and went exploring.\n\nHe leads her to a little courtyard with a pretty pond. She stops as her mouth hangs open. She points at the pond and giggles. \u201cLook,\u201d she whispers. \u201cTurtle-ducks. They\u2019re babies.\u201d\n\nShe tugs at him arm as she pulls him next to the water. The babies quack and swim around their mother. Azula sits down and watches the happy family. Zuzu sits next to her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking for her.\u201d\n\nAzula\u2019s shoulders slouch. \u201cWill Mother like me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He holds her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice person, and you\u2019re getting better every day. You\u2019re using Mother instead of Mommy. Soon, you\u2019ll be your devious self again. I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAzula, we both know you\u2019re\u2026 a little too young still.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nThe princess sees his smile and knows he isn\u2019t unhappy with her. She leans on his shoulder and watches the babies swim. Two footsteps walk to her. She turns, ready to protect Zuzu. Oh, it\u2019s Mai!\n\n\u201cHi!\u201d She waives.\n\nMai nods, but her attention is on the bundle of clothes in her arm. She looks so tired. They say giving birth is the hardest thing ever.\n\n\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d She points at the bundle.\n\nZuzu nods. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s our Izumi.\u201d\n\nAzula stands up and tip-toes to Mai and her niece. She looks at the newborn\u2019s face. It\u2019s so\u2026 squishy. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be so happy. Zuzu might look grumpy, but he\u2019s super nice. Mai might look irked and bored, but I know she will always love you. Oh, I\u2019m your aunt, but I want to be your friend.\u201d\n\nMai raises her eyebrow. \u201cWill you drop the baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nCarefully, Mai places the baby in her arms. Azula acts careful, super careful. She cradles the baby in her arms. She\u2019s holding a part of Zuzu, a new and living person.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d have more of a family, then Mai became my sister. Now, you became my niece. I thought babies were icky and annoying, but you\u2019re nice.\u201d\n\nShe sits back down by the turtle-duck pond. The baby sleeps soundly in her arms. \u201cOne day, I\u2019ll show you this pond and tell you about turtle-ducks. Did you know they have a mom too? Mommy turtle-ducks will do anything for her babies just like your mommy. It took me a long time to learn that about my mother. I hope you\u2019ll be smarter than me.\u201d\n\nThe baby wakes up and grumbles like Zuzu would on a bad day. Mai takes the baby from her arms, but she doesn\u2019t look angry. Instead, she walks away with the child.\n\nZuko sighs. \u201cI won\u2019t ever give up on you, Azula.\u201d\n\nShe blinks. \u201cZu\u2026 Zuko?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d His voice turns serious.\n\nShe keeps perfect eye contact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for everything you\u2019ve done. I was a burnout. I gave everything to\u2026 Father.\u201d She spits out his undeserving title. \u201cYou\u2019re putting me back together, not because I\u2019m a tool. You\u2019re doing it because I\u2019m your sister.\u201d\n\nHe nods.\n\nAzula looks at the sun, the undying fire. She beams as she\u2019s gifted with its warmth.\n\n\u201cThanks for being my brother, you big dum-dum.\u201d", "action_results": []}, null]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Save Zuzu", "result": "Azula leaves the crowd behind and walks back to her quarters. Father wants Zuzu dead. There\u2019s no way he could leave our nation by himself or with our tea-guzzling Uncle carrying him out. After she closes the door, she lets out a painful sigh. At least I\u2019ll be able to help him now.\n\nHe needs to get out of her nation and to travel the world. That means he\u2019ll need a boat, and since her brother has no navel experience, he\u2019ll need a small crew. Of course, Father would ensure the crew would have someone who would \u201caccidentally\u201d burn my brother to death during some sparring match. Regardless of his reasons, when the Fire Lord wanted someone dead, that person ended up dead. Right now, that person is her wounded brother.\n\nSince I\u2019d rather not have Father find out about my involvement\u2026 Azula waits patiently in her room. Today is Tuesday after all, a single blessing on what may be the worst day of her life.\n\nMai was the first one to arrive, prompt like any well-trained lady. Ty Lee was late as always. Since Mai seemed broody enough to kill someone and Ty Lee wouldn\u2019t stop crying, Azula assumed she didn\u2019t have to explain how her brother won\u2019t be seeing them any time soon.\n\n\u201cHave you finished your crying yet, Ty Lee?\u201d Azula glances at the door. Ever since starting these weekly get-togethers, she convinced the guards not to listen in. All the Royal Guards are still men. The young lady simply ensured her first meeting with her fellow females would\u2019ve made any man very\u2026 uncomfortable to overhear. It worked. The simplest plans are often the most effective.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The girl continues to cry.\n\n\u201cToo bad. We have work to do. Mai, are you even listening?\u201d\n\nThe girl blinks. Her eyes focus on the princess. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nNormally, that lack of respect would\u2019ve angered Azula. She\u2019ll give the girl a free pass this time. Her pre-arranged marriage to Zuzu will be called off by the end of the week. And that one would\u2019ve been an instance where the couple actually liked each other. It would\u2019ve made her sixteenth birthday more interesting to share it with a recently married sister-in-law. Oh well, it could happen anyway. Who knows what\u2019ll happen in five years between now and then? Also, marriage\u2026 Ew.\n\n\u201cMai, your parents have enough political connections. Find as many soldiers as you can who are loyal to Uncle Iroh. I want them with navel experience on a small vessel. About thirty. Be sure to have a good captain, cook, engineer, and several firebenders. Oh, try to have at least a few women in there too. I wouldn\u2019t want a whole bunch of men to carelessly get themselves killed.\u201d\n\nEven Mai couldn\u2019t hide the look of surprise on her face. Ty Lee stopped crying.\n\n\u201cAs for you.\u201d She points to her acrobatic friend. \u201cYou parents work on the docks with their merchant trading. Find a ship that no one will miss. Be sure it\u2019ll be well-stocked.\u201d She takes a pouch of gold coins and drops in in the girl\u2019s hands. In any situation other than this one, she\u2019d never trust Ty Lee with half that much. \u201cMaybe get some Komodo-Rhinos too. I want both of you done and to report everything back to me before morning. Go!\u201d\n\nWithout a word, they leave her bedroom.\n\nAzula walks to her dresser and pulls out a small chest. Ty Lee always wondered why I horded my allowance away instead of wasting it on momentary pleasures. She looks at the currency. Even if it\u2019s Fire Nation, our colonies would accept it. I think they\u2019d be more lenient with the banishment rules. Maybe he could trade the rest for Earth Kingdom coins.\n\nUntil the sun sets, Azula meditates. She\u2019d explode in frustration if she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s like being in a cage. She has no opportunity to do anything herself. Father can\u2019t ever find out how she\u2019s ensuring her brother\u2019s survival, but relying on others to do that work is hard even if they\u2019re her two most loyal assistants.\n\nTy Lee arrives not long after the sun set. The girl looked exhausted and not a coin was left in the bag. Even in the candlelight, Azula sees a smile on Ty Lee\u2019s face when she hands her a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cThey should have enough supplies to last them until next month,\u201d the girl whispers. Her brow scrunches. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the boat, the list of stuff I bought, you know\u2026 But, um, why are you doing this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d prefer to see my brother dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d She shakes her head faster than what\u2019s healthy for most people. \u201cIt\u2019s great and amazing, but you always wanted the throne. Now, you\u2019re the only option left so\u2026 Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Avatar hasn\u2019t been seen since Avatar Roku died. The next incarnation probably died in the Avatar State during the Air Nomad genocide. Zuzu\u2019s not coming back until I rescind that banishment after I become Fire Lord.\u201d She\u2019ll buy that.\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Her shoulders slouch. \u201cI\u2019m tired though and my parents might finally notice I\u2019m missing. If you see him, tell Zuko I wish him good luck. Also, um\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSpit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll make a great Fire Lord.\u201d\n\nTy Lee leaves the room. She was going to say something different. What? It\u2019s Ty Lee, probably something incidental.\n\nThe moon rises in the sky and starts to make its descent when Mai slinks into her bedroom. If Ty Lee was exhausted, then Mai must be moments away from collapsing.\n\n\u201cIt took a while. They\u2019ll be looking for Prince Iroh and Zuko at the docks tomorrow morning.\u201d Mai hands her a piece of paper with thirty names on it, in alphabetical order. \u201cThank Agni my parents never found out what I was doing.\u201d\n\u201cGet some sleep.\u201d\n\nMai turns around, but Azula takes her by the wrist.\n\n\u201cUse my bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be sleeping tonight. Tell your parents you spent all night ensuring you had the favor of the future Fire Lord.\u201d\n\nShe raises an eyebrow. \u201cI was ensuring your favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for doing all of this, Azula. Was\u2026 was the Agni Kai as bad as I heard?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\nAzula picks up the bag of coins, small enough to be hidden from the guard but large enough to fund Zuzu\u2019s expedition for a while. She leaves Mai behind.\n\nShe takes the back passageways of the palace to the infirmary. It wasn\u2019t hard to find Zuzu. He\u2019s the only one in there.\n\nAzula approaches him. The room has only one lamp as a dim light, but she sees the bandages wrapping the left side of his face. I wonder if he\u2019ll be blind in that eye. He sleeps, though it looks anything but restless.\n\n\u201cHave you come to gloat, my niece?\u201d Uncle slouches in a chair opposite of the bed. Azula forces herself not to shake her head. I should\u2019ve realized he was the reason Ty Lee purchased so much tea in the supplies. He could\u2019ve acquired all this himself, but someone had to watch over Zuzu. Maybe I should\u2019ve told Mai to do that. Then, Uncle could\u2019ve gone through this hassle himself.\n\nInstead of arguing, she hands her uncle the bag of coins and her two lists. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He squints, trying to read the symbols without adequate lighting.\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s a small ship, some of your former soldiers with seafaring experience, supplies, and a bag of money. The crew will meet you at the dock tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite popular opinion, I don\u2019t agree with the Fire Lord on every decision.\u201d She glances at Zuzu. \u201cTy Lee and Mai wish the dum-dum good luck. He\u2019ll be broodier than normal and have more angst than anyone should experience. I wouldn\u2019t like that. Goodbye, Uncle.\u201d\n\nAzula takes one more look at her brother and memorizes the sight. She sears it into her memory. Will she even recognize him next time they meet?\n\nThe princess leaves the infirmary and slips back into her room. The first rays of sunlight rise as she closes her door.

I\u2019d rather not have him killed. He is loyal, but I can\u2019t defy the will of Father and the Fire Lord. I must accept these things, but\u2026\n\nShe sighs. Zuzu is still her brother. Anyone, even the barbarians, deserve to have a fighting chance. Knowing Father, he\u2019d slit her brother throat under the cover of darkness. It\u2019d be effective but almost too effective. Zuzu will die no matter what happens, though he deserves to have a fighting chance.\n\nShe sneaks away to the one place Zuzu would go at a time like this. Azula would flee for the docks to secure passage to the barbarian lands or hide among her friends. Zuzu would\u2026 be Zuzu.\n\nThe princess enters his bedroom as he sits in bed, covers up to his chin. Beds are flammable, dum-dum.\n\nHe looks scared. He should be due to his imminent and approaching death, but her brother doesn\u2019t know that yet since he ran away like a coward. He\u2019s being a scared little boy.\n\nI should be direct. She sits on the side of his bed and stares at him. \u201cFather\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He backs away from her. Oh, right. I\u2019m Father\u2019s beloved child just as he\u2019s Mother\u2019s. I ALWAYS lie. Ug.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll sacrifice you. The Fire Lord wants him to experience the supposed pain of losing his son, so he\u2019ll get rid of you. It\u2019s not as if he cares anyway.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head. \u201cDad would never do that.\u201d Denial? At a time like this? Why can\u2019t you understand that our father wants you dead?\n\n\u201cFather doesn\u2019t love you. He doesn\u2019t like you. Maybe some Earth peasants would.\u201d Zuzu\u2019s really good at being a lovable idiot. Maybe some peasants would take pity on some lost Fire Nation noble. Then again, Zuzu would somehow tell them he\u2019s a prince and get killed. Plus, I want him dead, not alive. I don\u2019t like Zuzu, not at all.\n\n\u201cRun away?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cMopping the decks often gets free passage on merchant ships.\u201d I\u2019m doing this just to be mean. Not to help him.\n\nHis eyes move to the doorway. She sees the recognition on his face. I thought Father said he\u2019d do it tonight. Salvage the situation, Azula. Maybe I could act like I was trying to kill him?\n\n\u201cAzula.\u201d Fate must be on Father\u2019s side. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m warning your son, Mother. \u201cTalking.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d The tone and the tight grip on her arm don\u2019t allow for protests.\n\nAs she drags Azula out of the room, she hears Zuzu muttering, \u201cAzula always lies.\u201d\n\nThat HURT. She doesn\u2019t struggle at all as she\u2019s practically dragged through the halls. I\u2019m the only person in the bloody world that\u2019s trying to help Zuzu, but you\u2019ve entrenched your ideas so far into his head, Mother, that he refuses to believe me. You aren\u2019t good for him. You aren\u2019t good for anybody. Father\u2019s going to kill him, but you\u2019re the one who made him weak enough to kill. I wish you were gone. I wish you were dead.\n\nHer eyes light up. Dead. Gone. She sees a new opportunity. It\u2019d kill two birds\u2026 four birds with one stone. Father would be so proud if she could ever tell him. Too bad she can\u2019t and won\u2019t.\n\nThey stop in Mother\u2019s chambers. She stopped sleeping with father two years ago. Also, ew.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing, Azula?\u201d And she thinks I\u2019m the baddy here. I\u2019m just a monster. Father and the Fire Lord are amoral. I have principles at least.\n\n\u201cYou once said you\u2019d do anything if barbarians wanted to kill Zuzu.\u201d\n\nHer eyes narrow. For once, Mother looks dangerous. Maybe I inherited a few things from her, besides beauty, after all. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d Her grip on the girl\u2019s shoulder becomes painful. Maybe, it\u2019ll leave a bruise.\n\n\u201cFather\u2019s going to kill Zuzu tonight because the Fire Lord asked him to.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cTell me one reason why I should believe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour. Zuzu won\u2019t die. The Fire Lord will die. Father will get the throne, and you will be gone forever.\u201d\n\nHer shoulders slouch. I don\u2019t always lie. I\u2019m occasionally nice. More importantly, sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie.\n\n\u201cYou have a plan, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Azula smirks.\n\nLater that night, the palace erupts into chaos. Azula stands watch in the shadows outside Zuzu\u2019s door. He sleeps, blissfully unaware of the subterfuge and murder that just occurred. No matter what happens, she will not let anyone into his room tonight. Well, except that one. A figure gracefully approaches his bedroom. Unaware of the hidden prodigy, Mother rushes into his room. She shakes him gently.\n\n\u201cWha? Mother?\u201d He rubs his eyes. None of the guards are aware of the woman in his room. Father happened to ensure no one was around his son\u2019s bedroom tonight. Too late, Father. We spilt blood before you could.\n\n\u201cZuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you.\u201d She wraps his in a tight embrace. She loves you, brother. Now, she\u2019ll never see you again. \u201cRemember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.\u201d\n\nBefore he could say anything in reply, she leaves. To where, Azula doesn\u2019t know. All she knows is Mother will never return. She\u2019ll always live with blood on her hands instead of her son.\n\nAzula smiles, a real one.\n\nI got rid of you forever, Mother.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Sit Down next to Him", "result": "She walks up and sits down across from her dazed brother.

Ug, that sounds like Ty Lee and those auroras. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get to a battlefield. I\u2019d just get in the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich\u2019s why you should be my helper.
