You get up and wander over to take in the view, you've been staying in this room for a while now. Your not sure exactly how long but it feels like around 5 months, long enough to become used to it at least.\n\n\nYou lean out through the window and take in the sights, There are still some skyscrapers to the east looking in good condition, the stadium to the North isn't doing so well though, the roof has caved in and taken a small part of the wall down with it. Looking around you get a sense of general decay, between the points of interest are just fields of broken buildings and rubble. You know the couple of decades since the infection couldn't have done it alone so you decided it was the military. They had actually held out for years with relatively few casualties before it became airborne, after that it was chaos for a time until a 'vaccine' was found and sent world wide in an attempt to end the spread of the infection.\n\n\nYou take one last look around then head for the door. You picked this room since it not only had a working lock on the door but actually had glass in the window, seemed like a nice touch of normality. Sadly the food has run out and you've scavenged the entire surrounding area until nothing is left, you have to move on. At least now you have a destination. Just last week you had found a decrepit old survivor mumbling to themselves in a fever and learned that somewhere to the far east past the skyscrapers there is a thriving colony, THOUSANDS of people actually living and forming a good community.

The mutant types, animals who got directly infected, are very dangerous. The Crazies, humans who got the vaccine too late or were bitten after getting it, they retain some semblance of intelligence but only that of a stupid  flesh craved psychopath. Then theres the 'Heralds' or 'Harbingers', Nicknamed as the 'Harbingers of the apocalypse', they look nearly completely human but the infection somehow bonded with them making them stronger and faster than normal humans while retaining all of their intelligence, of course they still feed on living and partly decayed flesh, you avoid them at all costs.\n\n\nOnce you get close you very slowly open the door a crack and peek out.

Howling means mutant types and most likely dogs, your really don't want to fight a dog pack again. Last time you did that nearly nearly left you ripped into pieces and eaten.\n\n\nYou hold your breath but when the howl is heard again its much closer, close enough to be on your scent.

You know that the virus has made the dogs stronger faster and much much more dangerous than they were before so you keep sprinting up the fire escape only pausing briefly to see what is coming after you.\n\n\nIts hard to see in the dark but theres defiantly 3 or 4 smaller shadows following the larger one and they are moving at speed now towards the building. You resume sprinting until you close to the roof which you find is a single ladder to the top. You scramble up then lean over the edge to see what is going on below.\n\n\nYou see a lot of movement punctuated by barks and yelps when you think you make out one of the dogs leaping off a dumpster onto the fire escape, it creaks lower under its weight allowing more to jump on and within seconds its on the ground with the dogs surging up after you.\n\n\nYou stand and ready your bat. You assume the big one is the alpha and wont be able to jump high enough to reach you due to all the muscle it carries, you think it must weigh as much a a small car. The smaller ones however could probably get up to you if they were persistent so you going to have to fend them off.\n\n\nYou glance round the rest of the roof and see no movement so prepare for the attack.\n\n\nThe first dog to reach the top it pretty lithe compared to the others meaning it still looks like a Doberman on steroids and makes a jump at you, scrabbling at the ladder to try and get purchase. its head lines up nicely at your waist height and you meet it with a solid blow to the skull crashing it down onto its companions as they arrive. They ignore it and all start jumping at you keeping you fully occupied taking swings at them as they start to get purchase on the roof but not landing any more definitive hits.\n\n\nYour starting to get concerned when you hear glass smashing and see several windows are being broken out by undead inside. the dogs quickly loose interest in you in favor of the easier option of readily available food and launch into an all out attack on the shamblers trying to get out towards the noise.\n\n\nYou take the opportunity to rest and watch the fight unfold. The Shamblers are clearly just trying to reach the source of the noise while the dogs are actively attacking and trying to rip them apart. The shamblers only seem to fight back after an attack is aimed at them specifically, ignoring the others being taken down.\n\n\nThe mutants do easily the most damage at first, tearing several undead completely apart before they get too frenzied and start lashing out in all directions. One leaps in through the window and you hear lots of barking and growling before finally growing quiet and a shambler missing its left arm drags itself through the window. \"One got itself overwhelmed\" you think to yourself. You see another getting its rear leg bitten into by a shambler on the ground and hear the snap of the bone breaking before it pulled it away but it stays up and fighting until the huge muscled mutant and last smaller one tore the last of the shamblers apart.\n\n\nYou watch the three surviving dogs feast on the shamblers before heading back down the fire escape and disappearing South again out of the alleyway.\n\n\nYou finally relax and rest until first light when you head down into the alley again and start off North, you've got to be within a few hours of the stadium district now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the stadium district", "result": "You can tell by the changing architecture that you are nearing the stadium, just a few hours walking at most before you'll reach it.

They do wander, though but you get the odd impression that they never wander too far from where they died, circling endlessly for months before their flesh gives up and they become prey for the others.\n\n\nAs you get closer you begin to see the signs of battle everywhere, buildings collapsed, old craters, and burnt out cars. They had lasted a really long time in that stadium. You never went too close yourself but you occasionally saw the lights and the signs from tall buildings or when you were scavenging nearby.\n\n\nOver-confidence had been their end, just as you had predicted. Their regimented daily armored patrols, scavenging squads and clearance teams had, over the years, given way to weekly lightly armed excursions and missed guard duties. Their initial efforts probably cleared 95% of the infected in the area so they rarely if ever spotted one.\n\n\nYou heard from a few survivors you ran into right after what had happened.\n\n\n\u201cThe patrols were just for show and guards rarely bothered to turn up to their shifts by the end. One patrol team went out to do a mix of scavenging and clearing but they were all young had no idea what the early days were like. They went right inside some store on the outskirts of their territory without even checking for infected. A couple got bit when they found a shambler in a locked office. One turned right away and took two more down because they weren\u2019t ready to kill their friends. The two survivors finished the rest off and headed back to the stadium with their tails between their legs and covered with gore. Of course they immediately brought back all the old rules and regulations about ensuring the guard was always there and sending out veterans with the new kids but it was too late, one of the survivors had ingested some splattered blood during the fight and turned a few days later, sadly into a fast bugger. Went on a rampage biting everyone it saw. The people panicked and ran for the roof but it had been neglected for years and a strut failed, bringing the entire thing down, including part of the wall. Between the panic, the dead and the spreading infected inside it was all over and the survivors scattered and ran. No idea where they came from but a large number of dead swarmed them, as if they had been hiding and waiting all that time just to appear at the worst moment. Most probably died in the first few days to the infected or mutants.\u201d\n\n\nYou keep going as far as you can but the alleys become tighter and clogged with debris, you can keep to the alleys and clamber through them carefully to keep a low profile or you can head out to the main streets and move quickly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Keep to the Alleys and move carefully", "result": "Keep to the alleys and clamber through them carefully to keep a low profile\n\n\nYou don\u2019t want to risk getting fully exposed right now and decide to risk the alley ways.

But yes I am indeed a harbinger, I usually only get to tell people before they die rather than before I do but I guess I had a good run and ate my fair share of people\u201d you end with a bit of a grin, awaiting the bullets.\n\n\n\u201cOh you won\u2019t die so easily.\u201d The Capt.

Come on we will show you around.\u201d\n\n\nYou follow them around the accessible areas under the roof and see the paths up to the balcony where the men were on guard, you also notice that there are higher balconies with men in soldier\u2019s uniforms on them. \u201cProbably good I didn\u2019t run\u201d you think to yourself as you see the tents and shacks set up for sleeping and the tunnels used for storage.\n\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d One of the men says, looking around him. \u201cObviously there used to be a lot more here before the collapse but this is just the start.

We had contact with them some time back via a series of radios we were setting up in the city. This was right before the collapse O\u2019course. Seems that they got a really good thing going out there, clean food and water, even fields and solar panels up for power! Sadly when the roof came down, it took out our good radio equipment and most of the relays in the city are unreachable now without the manpower we used to have. We might not have enough men here to push through but we think if we hold out here and gather a good community then we can scout a safe route through the North of the city to the river and cross there. For now we are going to be the western safe zone for people unable to pass the city. You wouldn\u2019t believe the monsters we used to kill in there when we had out jeeps and heavy guns. Most people that try and get through the city to the bridges die trying or turn back having lost their friends, some tried to circle up North or South well past the city limits but seems that there are infected and mutants out there too and no way to safely cross the river unless you carry a boat.\u201d\n\n\nHe trails off and you can see he is thinking of past friends, he was probably one of the ones who tried to get through and failed.\n\n\n\u201cWell I better go get my stuff back and find a place to rest.\u201d You state.

Its not often you get to see they relatively close without having to run away after all.\u201d You joke.\n\n\nLuckily neither of them seems to think this is too out of the ordinary. \u201cYeh most new guys end up down here once they hear about it.

We did find out that destroying their joints and muscles is effective in slowing them down and they will die from large trauma, not just neural damage. So shooting knees and legs will stop them chasing you faster than a snail and body shots can kill them despite what anyone else says. We proved it with a fast bugger we found down here. 2 shots in the chest and he went down. Sure they can keep going with far more damage than a normal human but most things still work on them eventually.\u201d\n\n\nYou nod along, filling the information at the back of your mind for later, it matches up with your findings as well.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing the closer to human they are, the easier they go down then? The crazies seem to be just like humans, the fast ones a little tougher and the shamblers just soak up damage if it\u2019s not the head.\u201d\n\n\nThe man smiles and nods. \u201cA man of experience. I assume the vaccine gave you full protection if you were able to test all of that out. You are right of course, the further from human they go, the tougher they get, taking more normal damage to kill them. Destroying the neural center is always effective though, headshots I mean.

You explain that you\u2019ve always wanted to test how shamblers react to projectile damage as a way of killing them quietly. He has no issues but tells you that you\u2019ll have to write down your findings. You get a small notebook with columns to fill out for weapon name and type, type of damage, effect on the shambler, tissue types\u2026 the list goes on but you know it\u2019ll be fairly easy to fill out once you shoot them a few times.

Luckily you are alone today on a not very important post so you can relax and concentrate on the new sensations you mind is feeding you. After a few hours you find the haziness resolve into pockets that move about and decide that it must be linked to the normal people in the stadium. You can\u2019t get anything stronger from the shamblers yet but if you made this much progress just by sleeping on it, who knows what I can do in a few more days.\n\n\nThat evening you take a long pole with a spike on the end down, it will give you a good excuse to be close to the door for long periods of time while you pretend to stab at number 4.\n\n\nOnce you are seated and staring at him the sensations gets strong and you can easily tell when it feels pain from being stabbed. \u201cHuh, you don\u2019t outwardly respond but the pains still there, interesting.\u201d\n\n\nTwo more days pass of these mornings concentrating and evenings testing and by the end you can tell what is happening to number 4 or any of the other 3 shamblers even from up in the stadium. While you were eating lunch, you felt that number 4 got stabbed in the left shoulder, and sure enough when you went down, there was the doc writing down that stabbing it through the shoulder join restricted its movement in that arm.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m testing if it recovers from its injuries now so please avoid its shoulder and arm for now if you test more.\u201d He says as he passes you the book and heads up to eat.\n\n\nIt\u2019s now been several days since you arrived and you ran out of human flesh days ago. The food they give you doesn\u2019t sit well or seem to quench your hunger but the progress you are making is distracting you enough that you can ignore it for now. You are even getting on well with several of the others in the stadium which gives you doubts for the first time about your original plans to kill them all and feed off them. You could probably volunteer for a scavenging mission to try and get some food out there but you\u2019d probably only manage to get hold of some shambler flesh and it was simply not the same as normal flesh. Seemed just like the toughness, the further from human they got, the less useful their flesh was.\n\n\nBut for now you move onto the next stage, time to make the puppet dance for you.\n\n\nYou concentrate hard of the feeling you get from what you presume is the remains of the shamblers mind and try to make it lift its right arm into the air with little success, however, over the next few hours you see the arm twitch and eventually it responds and you see it lifting its arm up over its head.\n\n\nYou lean back against the opposite wall feeling elated by your success when the doc returns.\n\n\n\u201cHey! You\u2019ve got the mother of all nose bleeds there! Let me grab some gauze.\u201d He heads into his office and returns quickly while you dab at your own nose, seems you were concentrating so hard you didn\u2019t even feel it happening. You do however now feel fairly light headed so after being cleaned up and making your excuses you head up to lie down in your tent and very unusually fall asleep for the whole evening and night.\n\n\nThe morning brings the final revelation and the decisions. You wake to a solid feeling of not only where the four shamblers are, but roughly what they are doing. Concentrating easily makes number 4 turn in a circle and only a little more effort is required to make the others do the same. A slight tingling at the reaches of your mind tells you that you can sense other infected out in the alleys near the stadium.\n\n\n\u201cTime to make a choice. This mind stuff seems like a muscle, the more I use it, the stronger I get. Sleeping after a breakthrough only seems to reinforce it too. In days I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll be able to control small groups of the shamblers at the same time so I\u2019ll have to start testing on the other types next.

You go through the process as you had with the shamblers, concentrating on sensing them properly first, then getting an idea of their sensations and finally trying to make it react to your prodding.\n\n\nIt takes you about 2 hours but you finally have a good sense of what to do, its definitely a fast type infected and making them follow simple actions is only slightly different to the shamblers so by the time you reach your destination it\u2019s only a couple of streets away but you have it walking in circles on command.\n\n\n\u201cDude, you hit your face of something?\u201d one of the men quietly calls back to you and you realize that you have a nose bleed again. Not as bad as before but you quickly wipe it clean. \u201cYeh, sorry, I just get them sometimes.\u201d You say as you clean the blood off. \u201cGuess concentrating that hard on the other infected means I miss a lot, going to have to be more careful.\u201d You think.\n\n\nYou quickly realize that you have all arrived at the store, and there are several more infected in the vicinity. You were concentrating so hard on the one that you missed a second fast type not far off and several nearby shamblers. The rest of your team, completely unaware of the danger just streets away, starts to head into the store to check for the supplies.\n\n\n\u201cI guess I could go for the big test now.\u201d You think to yourself\n\n\nThe team is contained and you can control the infected, you could use them to take them out as the first step to destroying the stadium hold out or you could force them all far away and help the stadium people for now, some of them are treating you like a real friend after all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the first step to wiping the stadium out, use the infected to kill the team then eat them before returning", "result": "You\u2019ve wasted enough time playing happy families with this small community, your three team-mates will be the first to fall and become your food as you work to wipe them all out.

You send the fast types rushing at him and he barely has time to react before them knock him to the ground and start feeding off him.

It seems the vaccine isn\u2019t protecting him from direct exposure since you see his actions slowing down and the strange haze you sense from normal humans diminishes before your eyes. You send the rest of the nearby infected inside after the last survivor.

Here is the second.\u201d The old man says to you as a shambler comes in through a previously closed door and begins to lunge for you.\n\n\nYour old reflexes tell you to go for your bat but your new practice kicks in and you reflexively lash out with your mind instead. You see it suddenly stumble back against a wall as if physically struck, before sinking down and not moving any more. \u201cAh, and the second test passed too, you didn\u2019t have to kill it though you know?\u201d The old man says to you.\n\n\n\u201cErm, sorry about that, it was reflexive and I\u2019ve only been using this ability for a couple of weeks, I didn\u2019t know I could kill them.\u201d You suddenly feel your nose bleeding again and quickly pich it to prevent the blood pouring out on your clothing.\n\n\nThe old man gives you a very happy look. \u201cOnly a couple of weeks, well that is great news, it means you are developing very quickly. The quicker the development, the higher the potential! Well I accept you as my student.

Or you can leave now.\u201d\n\n\nYou glance around; he isn\u2019t holding a weapon or acting threateningly.

He clearly isn\u2019t making any obvious moves to trap you.\n\n\nChoose to stay and learn, it\u2019s what you are after all, a harbinger.\n\n\nBack out politely and head back to the stadium, you were happier there and the old man is a bit creepy.", "action_results": [{"action": "Choose to stay and learn, it's what you are after all, a harbinger.", "result": "You think about it carefully, he doesn\u2019t appear to be making any moves to trap you and you were getting to like some of the people back in the stadium, but wasn\u2019t your reason for going there in the first place to eat them?

Excellent, you will learn very quickly under my tutelage, now eat up, there is much to be done!\u201d He says to you happily as he tucks into the meat on the table.\n\n\nYou join him in the meal and feel better about your choice already, predators were made to eat their pray were they not?", "action_results": [{"action": "Training time", "result": "You spend the next couple of weeks with the old man, you have three meals a day of human flesh and spend most of your waking hours training your mind, you used to sleep only a handful of hours a night but now you collapse into bed each night with the beginnings of a headache.\n\n\nHe trains you hard, you constantly get nosebleeds but he doesn\u2019t push you too hard, it turns out that if you push past the pain of a headache, you can actually fry your own abilities and drive yourself mad, so you are trained until the headaches come, then you rest and eat until they pass.\n\n\nThe training pays off quickly. Within days of accepting your role as a harbinger and training to improve your abilities you feel faster and stronger than ever before, you begin seeing better in the dark and you can control an entire horde while barely trying.

They quickly took control of most of the city center and set up a colony of sorts, they actually let normals live there in a reasonable number so long as they obey the rules and treat the pair like Gods in their little playground.\u201d\n\n\nHe slows the jeep as he directs groups into holding buildings then continues when he is satisfied they are locked in.\n\n\n\u201cI found all this out right after I had destroyed the stadium and raised my strongest horde, I was overconfident and waltzed right into the city center to add powerful mutants to my ranks, the outskirts were all the normal types of dogs and cats among the shamblers etc. but I had heard that further in there were other types including mutated humans and I wanted to find those. I ran right into the \u2018Lords of the New City\u2019s\u2019 horde as they call themselves. They indeed had a couple of the human mutants and they tore through my ranks but I had greater numbers by far and won the first battle. That\u2019s the first I knew of their existence and they of mine. It seems that they had the larger and more powerful hordes overall but they were spread throughout the city center and I had just run into a small group. I obviously pressed the attack as I hoped to reach their little colony before the growing hordes I could sense on my flanks reached me but I was a little too late, they resized I was alone.\u201d\n\n\nFor the first time you see clear annoyance on the old man\u2019s face as he speaks. \u201cOne of them launched a mental attack on me, trying to invade my mind to stop me. It was the strongest attack I had faced but I was just as strong as him and fended him off easily, sadly the second one then attacked my horde. I knew I could not defend both against two minds so as I shielded myself, they whittled my horde down and took control of large numbers of them. By the time their re-enforcements arrive I had lost over three quarters of my horde and had to flee, leaving almost all the rest behind as well to cover my escape. That\u2019s why I need you; I\u2019ve been training my mind every day since then in order to attack again however I knew I needed an ally, a second mind to shield the horde as I shielded us.\u201d\n\n\nYou nod quietly as he speaks. \u201cSo this is why he needed me and took all the time to train and test me.\u201d You think to yourself.\n\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s an interesting proposition but I\u2019d want to know more before we attack\u201d You respond.\n\n\n\u201cOf course, of course, I\u2019ve been researching them since the last battle and have all the information you need back at my little shop!\u201d The Old man happily responds. It seems the prospect of revenge puts him into a good mood.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back at the apartment", "result": "Once back at the apartment above his shop you look over all the information the Old man had gathered. They were a pair of Harbingers now calling themselves the \u2018Lords of the New City\u2019. They ruled a colony of around a couple of hundred normal survivors, they had no fear of them trying to escape as they city center was still flooded with mutants and other infected. The old man didn\u2019t know why they kept them all, maybe as an insurance supply of food. They control a vast horde between them with groups spread around in a large circle to completely surround the colony.\n\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not too much but it\u2019s a good start, I assume you have a cunning plan?\u201d you say.\n\n\n\u201cAs cunning as a fox!\u201d He replies, grinning to himself about what must be a reference to something. \u201cWell two options really, the first option is the obvious assault plan. We both push into the city center and grab every infected we sense to add to our horde then attack their little base right away. I know there are far too many infected in there for them to control them all so we would probably reach our limit of control as well before we fought. After that it\u2019s a matter of shielding ourselves and the horde as we attack them and wipe them out. Once they are gone we can overrun the pesky colony to the East of the city too using the more powerful mutants. The other option is for you to go in undercover and help destroy them from the inside as I attack from outside, it\u2019s a lot riskier for you, however if you physically attack when they are mentally attacking me you might be able to take them out before the fight even really begins.\u201d\n\n\nThe old man is clearly leaving the choice up to you now, he needs you after all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Frontal attack, you aren't going to walk right into enemy territory alone.", "result": "You have no plans to wander into enemy territory alone without backup so you select the frontal assault. The Old Man nods and starts putting the map away. \u201cExcellent! We leave at dawn!\u201d\n\n\nYou head to bed, excited for what was to come.\n\n\nAs dawn breaks you are both well on your way to the city centre, collecting every infected you find on the way. The Old Man mostly walks in silence but he gives you little bits of advice every now and then \u201cWe face two enemies so each attack one, send your horde attack orders first so you need to concentrate on them less later.\u201d You always nod and add it to your information list of how to fight other harbingers, it seems though that the best tactic is simply overwhelming force. Impress upon them your superiority by outright crushing them.\n\n\nIt takes a few hours but you finally reach the outskirts of the skyscrapers and start sensing an incredible number of infected. At first you grab every find you can sense but it quickly becomes clear that there are so many here in the towering forest of buildings that you can afford to be picky.\n\n\nA few hours more and each of you is trailing over a thousand infected, with a huge number of those mutants of one variety or another. The Old Man cuts in again \u201cThe Lords took every human mutant in the city they could find, moved them close to them so we can\u2019t capture them, they are the hordes main targets.\u201d You once more nod as you walk. It will be interesting to take a few of them once you kill your rivals, after all this was where you were meant to be wasn\u2019t it. Leading a horde, devouring everything in your path and crushing your enemies. You glance left; you would have to kill the Old Man after too the battle. Can\u2019t have him trying to kill you or steal the humans.\n\n\nSuddenly the world becomes clearer and crystalizes for you. It makes perfect sense really, you are not just an Alpha Predator, you are THE Alpha, the rest of existence is for you to rule and devour as you see fit. Anything that opposes you will be crushed and utterly destroyed without mercy.\n\n\nYou see the Old Man suddenly look at you with suspicion, you are about to lash out at him for daring to look at you that way when he speaks \u201cGood, you are even stronger!\u201d A compliment, acceptable, you won\u2019t kill him yet, you need to use him first.

You feel the old man do the same and each of you slams your anger against the enemy.\n\n\nThey seem prepared and you hit against what seems like both of their wills joined together into one shield and it holds, but you can feel its weakness, you know it won\u2019t hold forever.\n\n\nYou keep pushing, ignoring everything else but attacking their minds, anything the Old Man taught you is ignored as you are better than him anyway and you will prove that shortly.\n\n\nYou can feel their defenses weakening moment by moment, cracks forming and barriers failing, you are stronger, the rightful ruler and devourer of humanity and no weak self-proclaimed Lords can stand in your way.

You immediately see his rage has grown and know why.\n\n\nYour forces are being decimated by the enemy, they must have been holding back some of their concentration to direct their forces against you. You let out a hiss the Old Man had lost this way before, how was he not prepared for it again, he was too weak a tool for you to use. You almost lash out at him there an then but the main threat was the Lords and their army. You quickly scan the battle to see what was happening.\n\n\nYour hordes had charged blindly, right into a huge block of shamblers who had soaked up all of the initial attack and taken the brunt of the damage like cannon fodder, then while your army was busy tearing shamblers and other useless infected apart the enemies mutants, including humanoids had clearly just torn right through your forces. The little extra control had turned the battle into a one sided massacre in seconds.\n\n\nYou let out an angry roar and concentrate hard on attacking again, leaving the Old Man to try and salvage some of his infected. You lash out hard again at the two minds but without the Old man, you are no longer crushing them, they are holding you at bay, you fall further into rage and push with all your might, thinking that you are still make some headway against them when you feel something hitting your own defenses. You had neglected them and pain shoots into your mind as you quickly shore them up but a small light seems to slip in a crack and your entire mind seems to suddenly explode with pain and colours, blocking all of your senses for several seconds.\n\n\nYou stagger back and rub your temples until your mind recovers, it was some cheap trick by them, your defenses were still intact. The old man laughs at you \u201cYou fell for such a weak trick? I trained you better than that! Now attack them while I salvage the horde you threw away!\u201d You simply hiss at him then turn back to your attack, they wouldn\u2019t get away with it.\n\n\nAgain you lash out and again at the peak of your attack your mind explodes in colours and lights. This time you hear the Old Man swearing when you return and see that the battle has been totally lost, there are also several humanoid mutants moving your way at incredible speed, some small but ridiculously fast, others larger than delivery vans yet still moving at speed.\n\n\nYou try and think of the best plan when the Old Man insults you again \u201cWeakling, you couldn\u2019t even distract them properly!\u201d This time was enough and you lash out at him only to be met by his attack, you strive against each other and this time you are almost equally matched.\n\n\nYou suddenly see him scream in pain and clutch his head, you try to push the advantage but your own head explodes in pain again and you realize too late that in your rage, you ignored the other enemies. As your senses come back to you, you see the fist of the monstrosity that reached you first. \u201cIt\u2019s first is the size of my entire torso.\u201d You think right before it slams into you.\n\n\nYou feel your entire ribcage crushing inward and destroying your organs, then your back hits something hard and blood is forced out of your mouth like a fountain. But you are still alive. You try to move, to get away but as you raise your head you see several of the smaller ones coming for you. The big ones now seem more concerned with the Old Man who is screaming at them \u201cI am the End of You! The Endmaster! You cannot stop me!\u201d sadly he is wrong as you see them catch him and tear his upper body in half before beginning to eat him.\n\n\nYou turn back to the ones near you, they seem small, almost weak compared to the others until one moves close faster than you even though possible for something to move, one moment it was several metres away and the next it was beside you and your arm was gone.

Pressing on your mind and attempting to destroy it the way you did the Old Man\u2019s. You lash out in return and they back off for a moment but you can already feel the difference in power. You know you could beat one of them but the two could hold you off until their horde reached you.\n\n\nYou run to the Jeep and throw the Old Man\u2019s body inside. The attack has returned and you find that your defense feels a lot weaker than your attack. When you lash out with your mind it feels like spears of flame, able to destroy anything but flames used for a defense feel less substantial and you know they won\u2019t hold out for too long.\n\n\nYou floor the gas pedal and start speeding away from the city Centre, back to the North West, You even know the perfect place to make your new base, the old Stadium is empty and defensible after all.\n\n\nAs you get further away the attacks weaken then stop. You expect to feel your horde being stripped away but it seems like they don\u2019t need too and you simply lose control as the distance gets too far. \u201cI even added to their defenses now\u201d you growl to yourself as you reach more familiar streets.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Empty Stadium", "result": "You reach the stadium as the fuel begins to run dry, there are two spare cans on the sides full of gas though so you aren\u2019t worried and park it at the back where you find a cover big enough to hide it.\n\n\nTime to start building up your empire.

You have some suspicions now about a trap, but why let you pass all the abominations which could probably kill you in the tight confines of the corridor only to try and kill you now?\n\n\nYou head through the arch and up the stairs and walk right out into what looks like an old circular arena, lit from above with a large pit in the middle, walled by concrete topped with glass and steel.

You retain your intelligence of course, but you see humans and harbingers as mere prey and you lose control to your urges, like the one you just felt to kill us.\u201d He raises an eyebrow to you and you nod to indicate that you are following along and that he was right about the urge to kill them \u201cYou colour is nearly red you see but it is not set, there are still other distinct colours there too which means you are not yet fully set in your decision, you believed what the Harbinger taught you but your final choice to live that way was not yet made, close, but not final.\u201d\n\n\nHe pauses to let you think. \u201cSo if I have given into my urges more and fully excepted that I was a preditor out to eat everything I would have been fully red?

Your last vestige of reason would have gone and the option to be anything other than a crazed killer would be removed from you. As for our green, it\u2019s a complicated one, not one of the \u2018pure\u2019 colours as others describe them. Our green means we have accepted that we are not human and not normal infected.

It will be something to think on, you haven\u2019t eaten anything but human in a while now though and you are already hungering for it. \u201cSo what about food, and you said \u2018Pure\u2019 colours?\u201d You finally ask.\n\nOne of them nods as he replies, still facing the games. \u201cBlue and red, they represent the \u2018pure\u2019 decisions as some call them. Red you know, blues are called guardians, the fastest and easiest ways to describe it is that they think they are superheroes, and I don\u2019t mean that in a funny way.

We are of one of the many in-between colours with our own strengths.\u201d\n\n\nThis gives you pause, they lower themselves to serve humans but they are un-matched in aspects of their power. You truly will need to think more and come to your decision. One of the men continues \u201cOh and as for food, you really eat whatever you want so long as it matches your choice, we eat infected flesh and normal human food, either works. You will probably find it safest to eat infected flesh for now as normal food won\u2019t sit well until your colour moves further from the red.

You did tell them about loosing some comrades recently to garner a little sympathy and from their looks they both knew what it was like to loose friends.\n\n\nTheir minds also resolved to be clearer and softer. Utterly different from the shamblers beside you, almost the opposite, exuding life and clearly full of thought and emotion but you find you cannot affect them in any similar way or gather feelings from them, just sense that they have them.

You clamp down, crushing his windpipe but as you feel it give way, you hear the thump of his heel hitting his chair. You quickly snap his neck but the damage is done and the chair tumbles off the edge and into the compound before you can stop it.\n\n\nYou swear to yourself and you hear the noise it makes but you know it wasn't really that loud, You almost think you got away with it when you hear the next guard calling out \"Hey Kiel, you fall asleep again!\" You quickly drop to the ground, the guard wont take long to get suspicious when their friend does not reply so you need to get the gates open fast.\n\n\nYou sprint between the houses, luckily finding most quiet and dark and come to the main gate. there are two guards here, one either side of the gateway and they are awake and chatting to each other.

The guard has found the body. \"Kiel is dead! we have intruders! help!\" You swear and rush towards the gate, leaping up and vaulting yourself onto the walkway behind one of the guards. He saw you coming and tries to raise his gun but you are faster and a punch to the throat sends him stumbling over the wall, only to get impaled on a spike before he can fully fall. the haze of his mind already gone by the time he hits the spike. You run and leap at the second guard, but this one has had more time and you see her with rifle ready. She takes the shot as you leap and you feel the impact in your side. You are certain she just got you cleanly in the kidney as you land and start punching her, not giving her time to work the bolt action for another shot.\n\n\nShe shot you though and the hunger fills your mind with anger as you punch her repeatedly in revenge, even though she was dead after the second hit..

So why were you asking about me?\" You smile this time\"Well you made quite the first impression on me when I arrived and I was planning on, you know, trying to get to know you a bit better over the next few weeks, when I heard you were awake now too I just kinda headed this way\".

They were cowards who never faced a real fight and though only of themselves, one of them would never risk sacrificing himself by staying in the compound before and after the attack. Even if the attack worked and he out-ran the infected at the gate, he would know he would be the main suspect. He also would have a hard time killing the armed guards alone, so if it was him, he had help from other raiders meaning there was no need for him to stay, he would have just run off instead.\" \n\n\nThe others pause and think about it for a time \"Then since we have nothing better we go with that.

Care quickly grabs you arm and leans in close \"Don't worry, if you get cold we can cuddle for warmth!\" She announces a little too loudly before jumping away again and dropping her bag off in a corner.\n\n\nYou realize you are blushing, so do the two guards who once more chuckle as they secure the door \"Stupid chuckle brothers, do you ever actually speak or just chuckle behind people all day long?\" You announce, only to send them both into fits of proper laughter. You simply sigh and lie down. Cara does pick to lie close to you but still far enough away to make the message of 'Don't try anything' clear enough.

Normally seeing a human wa enough to make your hunger spike but you haven't felt it in the last two days, even when looking at their energy filled minds.\n\n\nThen it stirs and you feel it  hiding in the back of your mind again \"I guess thinking about it was enough to trigger it again\" You think as you do your best to forget about it again as you all close the distance to the compound.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Safe-Haven of Safe-Haven", "result": "As you get closer the smudge resolves itself into a large grey wall topped with small spiked railings.

You look carefully as you approach. The walls are High, maybe 10 foot high and 12 with the railings, the spikes on the top were surely ornamental before but they have been sharpened now into points and you can see men with guns looking over the walls at various points. They are clearly the guards as they are holding guns however they are also clearly relaxed. they probably haven't had any real excitement since the raiders died out a few years back.\n\n\nYou look carefully at them and realize that none of them is actually reacting to you at all. you look around and realize that most of you is covered by farm hedges and gates so that unless they were being vigilant they wont notice you for a few minutes yet. \n\n\n\"Well the wall certainly looks impressive from here, but shouldn't the guards have spotted us by now, I mean we are out on the road?\" Care is about to respond when you hear a bell ringing \"Wel, they just did!\" she announces happily. Now when we get to the gate we are going to be harassed by Boring, we call him that cos it is what he is. Anyway just be polite and he will open the gate, he just likes to act tough to seem like he is in charge.\" She quickly gives you another kiss on the cheek and says \"Now remember I saw you first.\" Before walking ahead a little so she reaches the gate first.\n\n\nYou are wondering what she was meaning when you hear the call from the gate \"Who goes there\" and the immediate response from Cara of \"Oh shut up Boring and open the gate already!\" you just sigh and mumble \"so much for being polite\" you hear a chuckle as one of the guards passes you and adds \"As you have probably noticed, subtle is not really Cara's strong suit. good luck.\" you nod to him then join the group at the gate holding the bags while the little drama plays out.\n\n\nBy the number of people on the walls laughing you can guess that this has happened before and more than once. You can also tell it isn't serious by the number of them laughing as the man up top repeatedly tries to tell Cara off and explain procedures and rules and that your group is late while she just insults him, calls him boring and tells him to go die because he is so old.\n\n\nEventually you are told to prove you have no bites and remove your shirt and give them a turn so they can see, then you hear a female voice whooping at you from the wall and actually feel embarrassed. You get dressed again while you think about how strange it is for you to care about what a human thought. The gates swing open and Cara immediately breaks into the big grin and waves you inside. \n\n\nAs you walk in through the gate you get your first proper view of the little community, apart from the surrounding wall and wooden walkway you couldn't even tell that the world had ended outside. There is a group of nicely laid out houses in the center, a play park, a couple of mechanical looking buildings with tools and machinery inside and even a generator next to them.\n\n\nThe people are the same, clean clothing and all smiling and chatting as if the most horrific decade in human history wasn't still fully underway just past the gate you had walked through. One of the guards hops down behind you and several of the people come over, one is even carrying a toddler. The guard starts introducing everyone and you give short pleasant responses before realizing the thing that was bugging you the most. You look like a hobo, a hobo who had something die and rot on it's clothing recently and everyone around you is clean and well dressed for a rural community.\n\n\nYour realization and glances at your torn and stained shirt must have registered as one of the women cuts the guard off \"Let the man rest and get a change of clothing first before he gets embarrassed!\" You are about to object when you hear a whoop from behind you and a female guard from the gate comes running over \"I'll help, just wait till you see him with his shirt off!\" The older woman tuts at her \"Briar, behave yourself!\" but she just grins and turns to you \"Ok lets get you out of that shirt so I can burn it!\". You don't actually feel embarrassed about it and you haven't cared what humans thought for years but you do find it strange that the social conventions still hold such strong sway over you \"I wonder if they lingered around in the back of my mind of all this time being nice to Cara has helped them resurface?\" You think as you pull your shirt off and hear another whoop from Briar as she takes your shirt and heads off to a fire-pit near the walls. You also get some approving looks from the other ladies and glance down at your perfectly muscled self, \"here we go again.\" you think as you let the crowd of women take you over to a shed and hand you some new clothing and let you change in private.\n\n\nWhen you finally come out there is a larger crowd, including men ready to greet you and show you their little community. They take you on a whirlwind tour, showing off everything like proud parents showing off their firstborn child. It is all as you first saw, nice well loved little houses and a couple of old barns used as machine shops, The one thing that catches your eye is at the back. A huge metal door leading into a metal corridor that seems half buried at the back of the compound.\n\n\n\"That's our bunker!\" One of the men proudly announces \"If everything else fails, we can all live in there for months without any worries!\" You make a mental note to check it out.", "action_results": [{"action": "First evening in the haven", "result": "You are shown to a house that looks less well kept than the others and are told you can use it as your own \"An old member, called himself 'Playa' used to live here, sadly he was on a scavenge when they got attacked, him and his partner never returned so now it's yours.\" You thank them and head inside, finding yourself automatically wiping your feet as you do so \"Oh come on, I haven't wiped my feet in years, what am I doing?\" You head upstairs and find a nicely laid out bedroom complete with a full bead \"Although I really can't complain about this!\" You hop onto the bed and relax \"Even better than my van-sofa!\" You think as you begin making your plans.\n\n\nYou start by stretching out your senses and trying to count the humans, you find that they are often too close together to count perfectly but at least 30-40 which fits your initial guess. Several act as guards day and night and they have a fair amount of guns including at least two automatic weapons. They also have the bunker but there are ways of dealing with that too.

You no longer have the burning driving hunger constantly in your head pushing you to kill, but your stomach still rumbles if you go too long between meals.\n\n\nOnce there you are immediately greeted by several people and a couple of the younger women come over to give you food and chat.

If a shambler appears then you bat will be the best choice, a different kind or more than two of them and I\u2019ll use the gun while we retreat to meet up with the others!\u201d\n\n\nYou shrug and start forward; it was an acceptable plan after all.\n\n\nThe man whispers to you as you progress. \u201cNames Drak by the way, not the one my parents gave me of course but I took it on after the infection, has a nice ring to it!\u201d You nod back to him as you prod another garbage pile with your back and get no response. \u201cA lot of people did that, kind of like a new start thing right?\u201d You poke around inside a dumpster again for no response.\n\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d The man replies. \u201cFor all intents and purposes civilization ended, we are beginning anew in a new world so the new life begets a new name, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\n\nYou have just reached the backdoor and are about to open it when you hear a startled cry from behind you follow by two shots. Spinning around you see Drak with blood pouring down his arm and a dead shambler half out of a garbage pile you had just poked. \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond when you poked the pile then went for me faster than I\u2019ve ever seen one move!\u201d He manages before wincing and grabbing his arm.\n\n\nYou swear and force the door open; you both pile inside and slam it behind you. The others are headed your way guns at the ready. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d the leader calls out to you as they approach. You take half a step forward and do the talking for Drak since he is clearly in pain. \u201cWe were moving forward and being careful, I swear we poked and prodded every single piece of garbage when one leaped out and bit Drak.\u201d\n\n\nThe man swears and glances at him before turning back to you. \u201cDrak\u2019s always so careful too; we should get out of here soon. Grab what you can and let\u2019s go.\u201d You nod and turn to help Drak just in time to find him leaping at you, there\u2019s no time to react as he sinks his teeth into your throat and rips out a large chunk of flesh, you knock him off and stand up again but immediately feel dizzy, he must have caught an artery. You feel blood pouring down your shirt as you see him spring to his feet and come after you again.\n\n\n\u201cGorram idiot had to turn into one of the fast ones didn\u2019t he!\u201d you think as you meet his lunge with a swing from your bat. His head caves in and his body his the floor only moments before you fall too due to the massive blood loss.\n\n\nYou manage to roll over and see the leader of your team pointing his gun at you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is the only mercy I can give you now.\u201d He says as he fires.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, null]}]}]}, null]}, null]}]}, null]}, null]}]}, null]}, null, null]}]}, null]}, null]}]}
