All sides have been at war for a long time, and also evenly matched. Who will win? It will all be decided on tonight.\n\n\u201cHey! Its time to go to bed!\u201d you Mom says coming into your room.\n\nOr at least it would be, if you didn\u2019t have to go to bed!\n\n\u201cAw Mom! I was just about to do something!\u201d you protest.\n\u201cWell you can do something tomorrow, right now its bedtime, you know the rules. But before you do remember to brush your teeth and put these toys away.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but can\u2019t I leave them out? I got everything set up and like everything! The final battle for the universe is going to take place!\u201d\n\nYour Mom surveys everything you\u2019ve set up. You have a myriad of unusual toys and figures standing next to each other. You have plastic knights standing next to space men defending a castle made of blocks on one side while across from them has a combination of green army guys in vehicles and some metal robots. And yet on the far side of your room is another army set up consisting of dinosaurs and some other monsters. She just smiles at your creativeness.\n\n\u201cVery well, it looks like you went to a lot of trouble, so okay. You certainly do have a vivid imagination to come up with some of the games you do.\u201d\n\nHappily you go brush your teeth, and think about the battle that\u2019s going to take place tomorrow! General Razor will try to storm the castle and Lord Justice will defend it! And then the Dino Demons will try to destroy everything! It\u2019s going to be so cool!\n\nAfter brushing your teeth, you head back to your room where you carefully step around the figures you\u2019ve set up with care and get into bed. Of course as usual, you don\u2019t fall asleep right away; you read a couple pages of your favorite comic book first. Man you wish real life wasn\u2019t as boring as it is. There\u2019s no magic, no super heroes, no giant robots, no nothing! You often wished you lived in a world with all of those things.\n\nYou turn off the lights in your room when your Mom checks on you again and demands you go to sleep. You\u2019re still a little to wound up to fall asleep though, so you just lie in your bed thinking how tomorrow\u2019s battle is going to play out.\n\nOf course one bad thing about having an overactive imagination is letting it run away with you. Your room is dark, with only the dim moonlight shining in and creating creepy shadows on your walls. You begin to think the shadows are moving, begin to get a little scared and hide under the covers. Then you think back to something your mom told you the last time you got scared like this: \u201cMonsters aren\u2019t real. Nothing like that exists in this world.\u201d\nOf course she\u2019s right, after all you just thought the world you lived in was boring by not having those types of things in it.\n\nYou slowly peer out from under your covers, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t the work of your imagination. These shadows ARE moving and now they\u2019re right by the side of your bed. Red dots form their eyes and a bluish light form their grinning maws. Before you can cry out, one of them puts its hand over your mouth and puts its other hand to its own with its index finger to its lips. (Or rather where its lips would be if it had any)\n\n\u201cShhhhhhh, the master wants to see you\u2026there will be plenty of time to cry then, little one. Open up the portal.\u201d The shadow says\n\nSuddenly a purple portal opens up where your closet is, and two of the shadow creatures grab and carry you into it. The shadows run around you as you\u2019re carried down the green tunnel which the portal has lead into. They excitedly talk about how their master will be pleased for getting you. Of course all you\u2019re doing right now is panicking, and you start to struggle to get away, surprisingly, you manage to break free of their grip and start trying to run back to where they entered this thing.\n\n\u201cGet him! He\u2019s trying to run away!\u201d\n\u201cDo it quickly before the portal starts collapsing!\u201d\n\nAs you hear the shadows giving orders to each other, the portal tunnel that you\u2019re in is indeed starting to flash and blink a lot, when you look down at your running feet, the purple light \u201csupporting\u201d you disappears every now and then revealing only blackness. You can see your room just up ahead and you ALMOST reach it, before the green tunnel disappears completely.\n\nYou yell and scream about how you wish you back home as you fall through the endless void, and while that doesn\u2019t happen, you do suddenly appear someplace else\u2026\n\nYou land roughly, scraping your legs and knees and getting your pajamas all dusty. After brushing yourself off and rubbing your hurting legs, you get a better look at your surroundings.\n\nYou\u2019re in what looks to be the middle of nowhere, though there is a small group of rickety looking houses nearby, probably a small village.\n\nOne thing is for certain, you know you aren\u2019t on Earth, because, a small multi-colored lizard like creature with three eyes scurries by your feet and into the wilderness beyond. You\u2019re still scared, but also fascinated by this place; however, you realize you need to figure out how to get back home and what exactly is going on.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to the village", "result": "Upon entering you see many of the villagers just sitting outside their houses doing nothing, though a couple of them are lazily plucking some sort of stringed instruments. They barely pay any attention to you at all.\n\nYou know you\u2019re not supposed to talk to strangers, but in this situation you don\u2019t really feel like you have a choice, so you ask one of them for help.\n\n\u201cHey, I need some help, these shadow things attacked me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWazzat? Shadows? Shadows don\u2019t come \u2018round here boy, we\u2019s got ourselves a wizard to protect us! If you got shadow problems, maybe you should talk to him. He\u2019s a pretty smart guy. He\u2019s in that nice lookin\u2019 house over there, the one with the roof! Careful though, he\u2019s usually in a bad mood. Argues with his wife constantly too.\u201d The fat villager says going back to drinking whatever it is he\u2019s drinking.\n\nNot knowing what else to do you head over to the wizard\u2019s house. As you approach you can hear arguing from the inside.\n\nYou knock on the door which is opened by a young woman dressed in a waitress like outfit. She\u2019s pretty, but looks very tired, behind her appears an older man who doesn\u2019t look much like a wizard at all.\n\n\u201cWhadda you want kid? We ain\u2019t buyin\u2019 anything!\u201d he scowls.\n\u201cAre you really a wizard? You don\u2019t look like one.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he isn\u2019t a real wizard. He\u2019s a lazy charlatan!\u201d the woman answers.\n\u201cShut up Talia, I was good enough to get YOU.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s because I was too young and na\u00efve to know any better! I knew I should\u2019ve married a knight!\u201d\n\u201cHah! And what knight would marry a serving wench like you?\u201d\n\u201cMelcar, I don\u2019t have time for your nonsense today, I have to go to work. Can you at least TRY to do something productive while I\u2019m gone, like casting some cantrips to cut down the overgrowth in the backyard? Sheesh, I think I saw a nest of Furms making their homes in there and you know much I hate those little purple things! They infest everything and then you can\u2019t get rid of them! So can you DO that one thing, if nothing else?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\n\nThe woman throws her hands up in dismay and leaves the house, leaving Melcar and you alone.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your deal kid? I know you ain\u2019t from this backwoods village because I know everyone here and you actually look like you bathe every once in awhile. You lost or something?\u201d\n\nYou explain your situation to Melcar, somehow he doesn\u2019t look surprised, but he does look a little more interested in you.\n\n\u201cHmm, sounds like the Nightmare Tyrant. He has a habit of snatching people from other dimensions and draining them to harness his power. Those shadows you encountered are what\u2019s left of his victims. I\u2019m not entirely sure of his methods for choosing, but I do know he only takes those with strong imaginations though. It\u2019s probably why he prefers children since they tend to be more inclined to think up fantastic things.\u201d You were lucky to escape from him.\u201d\n\u201cWell how do I get back home?\u201d\n\nMelcar looks at you a moment before replying.\n\n\u201cYou interested in doing a little yard work?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really busy with an experiment, and I just don\u2019t have time to mess around with clearing the overgrowth in my backyard. If you do it, I think that\u2019ll give me time to complete my experiment, as well as giving me time to look up the spell that can take you back home.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGood, there\u2019s a scythe in the back. You shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble.\u201d\n\nMelcar closes his door and you walk around the back, which literally looks like a jungle. The grass is almost as high as you are and the scythe is a little too unwieldy and large for you to use properly. Soon tiny purple people appear and angrily throw small stones at you and squeak some sort of jibberish. They apparently don\u2019t like you trying to tear up their home.\n\nYou don\u2019t see how you\u2019re ever going to finish this task.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to scare away the purple people", "result": "You try to scare the little purple people much like you\u2019ve ran after pigeons in the park, however the purple folks won\u2019t be chased away so easily, this is their home after all, they just nimbly get out of your way and continue to pelt you with stones, which are really starting to hurt at this point, and a particularly large stone smacks you in the head knocking you out.\n\nWhen you wake up you\u2019re nowhere near the Wizard\u2019s house anymore, in fact you\u2019re quite a ways outside of the village! The purple people must\u2019ve dragged you here. As you groggily get up, you wish that someone would help you. Just then a shadow looms over you, at first you get scared again, but fortunately this one is attached to someone. You look up and see a woman dressed in leather armor, she carries a bow on her back and a sword by her side. She gives you a serious look while she grabs your hand to pick you up. You notice she has pointy ears.\n\n\u201cBoy, what\u2019re you doing out here? Don\u2019t you know it can be dangerous out here? Do you live in that village?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cNo, I was trying to look for help there. There was a wizard who said he could help me get back home if\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWizard? There wasn\u2019t any strong magic activity detected around here boy. Where are you from?\u201d\n\nYou explain your story, as the woman listens intently. Much like the wizard you ran into earlier, she doesn\u2019t seem surprised.\n\n\u201cMm, yes you are a lucky boy indeed to escape from the Nightmare Tyrant, most never even have a chance. I think you better come with me, my name\u2019s Lyssia\u201d\n\u201cBut the wizard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll be safer with me, than that so called wizard you mentioned. Sounded like a hedge wizard that was just getting you to do some grunt work that he didn\u2019t want to do. He couldn\u2019t help you against the shadows, let alone get you back home. I might be able to though, well the Captain might anyway. We\u2019ll head back to my platoon\u2019s camp.\u201d\n\nYou feel somewhat safer with Lyssia, not to mention she seems like she\u2019s more readily going to help you, so you follow her. Eventually you arrive at a fairly large camp with armored knights, horses, and tents. Most of them look like they\u2019ve been doing a lot of fighting recently and are still recovering from their wounds. When you enter the Captain\u2019s tent, you see him looking over some maps before he looks up at you. He\u2019s a man of average build, but his weathered and tired face shows the signs of having been in battle several times. His armor displays likewise.\n\n\u201cLyssia, you better have a good reason for why you\u2019re bringing this boy into my presence. This is a mobile military unit; you know we can\u2019t be coddling civilians, let alone children.\u201d\n\nLyssia explains the situation and the Captain\u2019s attitude towards you changes to a more sympathetic one.\n\n\u201cEscaping from the Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s minions is no small feat, especially for one unprepared for such an encounter. The terror they radiate is normally enough to paralyze most with fear. You\u2019re obviously not a battle hardened soldier to such horrors, and there\u2019s no evidence of any magic about you. You must have an innate strong will, boy. Which is good since you\u2019ll most likely have to deal with them again.\u201d He says grimly.\n\u201cAgain?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYes, unfortunately the Nightmare Tyrant isn\u2019t fond of losing those he marks for capture. He has no doubt sent his Shadow minions to look for you. Fortunately you have us to help you now. We are a recon team for the Parran Empire, we\u2019ve been fighting the Nightmare Tyrant for years, trying to find a weakness with little success. Though after some searching we think there may be a powerful weapon that can help us. It\u2019s in some ruins a few days from here, or should be. One can never know for certain with old legends. Now, I have a duty to defend innocents from evil, but I also have a duty to the Empire. I simply cannot take this team all the way back to the Empire just to drop you off there where our wizards can send you back home, I have a mission to complete first. You can either stay with us and then after the mission we shall all go back together, or I shall send a couple of my men with you back to the Empire. Keep in mind the Shadows are probably looking for you and they tend to hunt in swarms, so the more people defending you, the better.\u201d\n\nYou really want to go back home, but you\u2019re a little worried about not having all the protection you can.\n\n\u201cWell can\u2019t Lyssia go with me?\u201d you ask hopefully. Lyssia smiles a bit at your request, but the Captain shakes his head.\n\u201cSadly no. While I can certainly understand and admire your judgment of wanting her to go with you, I cannot allow her to do so, as my mission will undoubtedly require her skills. As I said, I will send to two of my men, but that is all I can spare if you decide to head back to the Empire.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Head back to the Empire", "result": "The sooner you\u2019re out of this place the better, so you request to be escorted back to the Empire where their wizards can send you back home.\n\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll send Paladins Salzat and Lakri with you, along with an official letter explaining your situation. Good luck and may you return home without any ill-fated encounters.\u201d The Captain says handing you the letter for safe keeping.\n\nYou are presented to Salzat and Lakri who are explained their mission. Salzat doesn\u2019t look pleased; in fact he gets angry and exclaims his skills would be better put to use fighting the Nightmare Tyrant and other evil creatures, not looking after a child. Lakri on the other hand looks relieved. After the Captain shouts him down and tells him to obey orders, Salzat grumbles and gets on his horse. Lyssia puts you on your own horse, you\u2019ve\nnever ridden one before, but she assures you that these are the best trained horses in the Empire and will serve you well. You\u2019re told you should reach the Empire in a few days.\n\nSoon you\u2019re off with your new travel companions They couldn\u2019t be more opposite. Salzat is a mean looking man with scars all over his face who barely speaks to you, but his armor is impeccably clean and well taken care of. It even has a shine to it, almost as if it was brand new. (He doesn\u2019t seem to wear a helmet though, perhaps that might explain all the scars) Lakri on the other hand is much kinder and talkative to you. His armor looks like its seen better days though. It\u2019s metal that looks hastily welded together, badly dented and even showing signs of rust! Unlike Salzat his suit of armor has a full face helmet which he\u2019s wearing right now and Salzat has chosen to taunt him about.\n\n\u201cLakri, why are you wearing that thing? We aren\u2019t even going into battle you coward! I swear I don\u2019t know how any of you can see in those things anyway. I need to be able to swivel my head as quick as possible so I can see the next enemy I have to slay!\u201d\n\u201cLeave me alone Salzat! I like to make sure I\u2019m protected! I don\u2019t want to end up all scarred and ugly like you! I intend on getting married one day!\u201d Lakri sputters.\n\u201cFeh! I don\u2019t need to look pretty; my DEEDS will win the hearts of damsels!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you guys become Paladins?\u201d you ask. Surprisingly Salzat answers your question right away.\n\n\u201cWell unlike Lakri here, I didn\u2019t have royal family connections. I worked my way up through the ranks and went through special training so that I could become a weapon against evil and serve the Empire. If I could wipe out all the evil in this world myself, I would not hesitate to do so. There is no greater deed than to serve the cause of good and righteousness and right now my talents are going to waste escorting you!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well I for one am glad for the break from battle. This is a nice change of pace than fighting trolls, shadows and other such nastiness. I wasn\u2019t really looking forward to going to those ruins the Captain mentioned either. Sounded dangerous.\u201d Lakri says.\n\u201cYeah, well we know you\u2019re a coward anyway, and a disgrace to the Paladin name.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a coward! I\u2026just want to live alright? I mean is it so wrong that I prefer my life to not be at risk every five minutes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you become a Paladin, if you don\u2019t like to fight?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a long story\u2026let\u2019s just say my Dad wanted me to.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re a grown up, shouldn\u2019t you just be able to do what you want now?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! You think just because one grows up, you aren\u2019t subjected to being told what to do by your parents? Guess again. Ah well, perhaps you have less demanding parents. You must certainly like them, if you wanted to get home so quickly to see them again.\u201d\n\nBefore you can answer, Salzat suddenly looks up in the sky and draws his sword.\n\n\u201cShut up! I sense something\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly the sky grows considerably darker within only a few seconds and screeching can be heard from above. Dark winged creatures begin to descend from the sky\n\n\u201cSHADOWS!\u201d Lakri shouts.\n\u201cAlright! And here I thought I wasn\u2019t going to get to vanquish evil today! Come on and be destroyed foul creatures!\u201d Salzat laughs.\n\nAt this point Lakri and Salzat show their differences again. Lakri panics to the point that he fumbles and drops his weapon before yelling that you all should make haste to escape. Salzat on the other hand turns to face the winged Shadows. You don\u2019t see how he can possibly fight them all himself though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow Lakri", "result": "You\u2019re in no position to fight a bunch of flying Shadows, you\u2019re not armed with anything, and nowhere near being a warrior. You take you horse in the direction that Lakri headed, leaving Salzat behind to fight the Shadows, though you aren\u2019t safe yet as a few of them are still in pursuit of you.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one the Master wants! The little one! Get him! Get him!\u201d you hear raspy voices shout behind you.\n\nSoon your horse has almost caught up to Lakri\u2019s. Lakri seems to have forgotten that he\u2019s supposed to be DEFENDING you!\n\n\u201cHey! Aren\u2019t you supposed to be protecting me?\u201d you shout at him, while briefly looking behind you to see how close the Shadows are.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026I just\u2026ARGH! Shadows! Gotta get away! Don\u2019t follow me, they\u2019re after you!\u201d\n\nLakri must be so frightened for his own life that he\u2019s gone half mad! Seeing that he\u2019s not going to lose you, he ends up jumping off of his horse and running off into the wilderness in an effort to ditch the Shadows. It works for him since they were never after him and they continue to follow you and are starting to close in\u2026\n\nSoon one is close enough to grab at you, in an attempt to rip you from the back of the horse.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attempt to punch at the Shadow", "result": "With your free hand you attempt to punch the flying Shadow, but unfortunately it deftly dodges your attack and you unbalance yourself causing you to fall off the horse.\n\nYou don\u2019t land on the ground though since the flying Shadows swoop in to catch you before that happens. Of course now you\u2019re in their evil clutches. They laugh and cackle with glee as they take you back to the Nightmare Tyrant.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hold on tight to the reins", "result": "You pulls away from the Shadow and hold on as tight as you can, hoping that somehow the horse can outrun these creatures, or at least hoping that someone can help you.\n\nNo sooner have you thought this, when suddenly you hear a sizzling sound followed by an ear piecing screech from above. The Shadow trying to rip you from the horse has been struck down by some sort of bolt of lightning. Soon another Shadow is destroyed in the same way\n\n\u201cCursed Shadows! Just hold on to the reins boy and keep moving! There\u2019s a town up ahead where you\u2019ll be safe!\u201d you hear someone yell at you. You notice some trees and rocks along side of the road, but no people. Whoever it is helping you must be well hidden.\n\nEventually all the Shadows following you have been destroyed by bolts and you make it into the town, though you aren\u2019t sure of what to do or go next, but for now you\u2019re just glad to be alive. (Your horse has even clamed down a bit)\n\nWhile you just temporarily rest on top of your horse, you hear the voice of the person who helped you again.\n\n\u201cAh there you are, glad to see you\u2019re alright. What\u2019s a boy like you traveling by himself in these dangerous times anyway? The wretched Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s minions seem to be everywhere nowadays.\u201d\n\nThe one who\u2019s helped you looks like a little different from what you expected, this man looks more like a warrior, but not like the knights you encountered earlier. More like a barbarian type. He\u2019s bristling with muscles and has a large axe carried on his back.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a Wizard.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t, because I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cI thought only Wizards could cast spells.\u201d\n\u201cOh that lightning bolts back there? That\u2019s thanks to this magic ring I found a long time ago. Though I think it\u2019s out of charges, it\u2019s useless except maybe to trade with now. Here, why don\u2019t you take it.\u201d He says giving you the ring.\n\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019m supposed to be heading to the Parran Empire to get back home.\u201d\n\u201cYou live in the Parran Empire?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but they\u2019re supposed to have Wizards there who can help me get back home.\u201d\n\nYou go into detail about your adventures to the barbarian; he seems a lot more surprised by your tale than the rest you\u2019ve told have.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s some tale boy, though I have no reason to disbelieve you, given the things I\u2019ve seen since my own travels as well as the things I have heard about the Nightmare Tyrant. His darkness has even reached my old homeland far north, though my people tend to be nomadic and the land doesn\u2019t really contain anything of major importance. We had more problems with the usual menaces of giants and trolls more than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re so far from home?\u201d\n\u201cWell as I said, my people are nomadic in nature, and I guess I\u2019m even more so. I wanted to see other places outside of my homeland, so I traveled south to where civilization tends to thrive. I\u2019ll most likely return one day.\u201d\n\nBefore you continue this conversation, you have just realized you don\u2019t really know the route to get to the Empire. The Paladins were supposed to lead you there and now both of them are gone. You don\u2019t know who else to ask, you\u2019re all by yourself again and this barbarian did help you, so you give it a shot\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, um\u2026could you help me get to Empire? I don\u2019t exactly know the way.\u201d\n\u201cMe? Well, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the best person to ask, seeing as I\u2019ve never been there either, though I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem, all I need is a few directions from someone and I could probably get there quickly\u2026sure why not? As I said, I\u2019ve never been to the Parran Empire lands so it wouldn\u2019t really be a wasted trip for me, but we probably should find a room somewhere first. Also I\u2019ll need to ask for directions. My name\u2019s Qualan by the way.\u201d\n\nQualan rents a room for the pair of you, but he doesn\u2019t stay, instead he says he\u2019s going to go ask for directions and explore the town a bit, and for you to just stay in the room and not to open it for anybody. He has the key, so he can let himself in. Soon you\u2019re alone again in a relatively barren room. It\u2019s pretty boring in here, but you try to keep yourself occupied, namely by thinking of all the people and places you\u2019ve encountered since you\u2019ve been here. In fact this is the first time you\u2019ve actually got the chance to reflect on this little adventure. You also wonder about your Mom, she\u2019s going to be worried about you and probably have the police looking all over for you! And when you finally do return, what will you tell her?\n\nYou don\u2019t know, but what you do know for certain is that you DO want to get home as soon as possible. You find this place very fascinating, but the Shadows and the Nightmare Tyrant who\u2019s taken an interest in you is something you can do without. You just wish you had something that you could fight them off with\u2026\n\nNo sooner does that pass through your mind when you notice something glowing under one of the beds. You cautiously check underneath it, and find a short sword. It faintly glows with a white light for a moment longer and then fades back to its normal color.\n\nAfter \u201cplaying\u201d with the sword for a bit, you suddenly realize that you created the sword, or you at least made it appear. In fact you\u2019ve caused quite a few things to occur just by \u201cthinking\u201d. It seems like every time you \u201cwished\u201d for help, it suddenly arrived.\n\nMaybe you have magical powers here or something similar, this all can\u2019t be a coincidence.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wish to be back home", "result": "If you knew that it was a simple wish that could get you home, you would\u2019ve done it a long time ago! You begin to think really hard about going back home. You close your eyes and try to visualize it.\n\nFor a moment you think you\u2019re succeeding, but suddenly all you begin to see is a black void and Shadow creatures. Something terribly wrong is happening. You really know it when you open your eyes and see nothing but darkness and you are being held down on some sort of smooth cold surface by Shadows and you no longer have your sword. A sinister voice emanates from the darkness and you\u2019re completely paralyzed with fear.\n\n\u201cAh, yes I knew it would only be a matter of time before you tried that to get home. Fortunately I made plans ahead of time to prevent that from occurring. Of course, in a way you ARE home. Your new one anyway.

There\u2019s no telling where you might end up if you tried it again. So far \u201clittle wishes\u201d have worked for you, so you\u2019re going to stick with the current plan of getting the Empire wizards to send you home and use your \u201cpowers\u201d only when necessary.\n\nYou eventually fall asleep with your new sword by your side, you\u2019re awakened by Qualan in the morning.\n\n\u201cHey, get up boy let\u2019s get going\u2026 where\u2019d you get that sword from?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh\u2026well uh I found it under the bed.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, I know I\u2019ve forgotten a few things in my travels, but never a weapon. That\u2019s just unthinkable. You probably should have a sword anyway, I\u2019m not sure how it is where you\u2019re from, but a boy your age would definitely be somewhat familiar with a weapon of some sort by now in my tribe.\u201d\n\u201cWhere were you?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I was getting directions to the Parran Empire, and exploring the town a bit\u2026well okay I was exploring the tavern, in fact I eventually explored the floor of it. Oh well at least nothing was stolen, not that I have anything left after spending it all at the tavern\u2026hey you still have that silver ring? I think I might need to trade for a horse. I can\u2019t be accompanying you efficiently if I\u2019m not on horseback as well.\u201d\n\nAfter giving Qualan the ring back, and uses it to buy a broken down nag, you and he are on your way again. You and he talk during your uneventful travel; he\u2019s very fascinated with your world as you are with all the adventures he\u2019s been on. Soon you come to a split in the path. You ask which way to go.\n\n\u201cWell, both of these paths will eventually lead to the Empire, but one of them is a lot quicker. There\u2019s a catch though, back in town I was told the quicker path is currently under complete control of a vicious goblin tribe. Apparently they\u2019re attacking anyone that goes through there. I heard The Empire was supposed to send in some soldiers to take care of the problem, but the Nightmare Tyrant is a more immediate and dangerous threat and as such they\u2019re concentrating their efforts on him instead. The second path is supposed to be safe and clear, but it\u2019ll take longer. We\u2019ll probably have to make a camp somewhere, before we even reach the Empire.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take the safer route.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAlright, but keep alert anyway, just because I heard it was safe doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is.\u201d\n\nYou and Qualan travel further with no unexpected encounters. When it begins to get dark you half expect Shadows to come attacking you out of the sky again, but this is a natural darkness, night is merely falling. Qualan suggests that you should make camp and you do so. You and he eat the provisions he bought from town. He comments on how bad they are and next time he\u2019s just going to stick to hunting in the wilderness for food next time.\n\nYou\u2019ve never slept outside before, so like most things in this adventure it\u2019s a brand new experience for you. One that makes you really wonder why some of the kids at school have said they like camping so much. You\u2019re definitely a city boy!\n\nAfter trying to get comfortable several times and not worry about bugs crawling on you, you fall asleep, but not for long. A noise awakens you and Qualan. The horses seem agitated as well.\n\n\u201cQualan?\u201d\n\u201cShhh! I heard it too\u2026be prepared for anything.\u201d He says standing up and readying his axe.\n\nSoon a large figure lurches out from the darkness. It\u2019s another Shadow, but not like any of the ones you\u2019ve encountered before, this one is bigger for one thing, almost as if its armored and for another it looks vaguely familiar. The black figure is hard enough to make out by the campfire, but when it speaks you know immediately who it is.\n\n\u201cAt last I\u2019ve found you boy.\u201d\n\u201cSalzat?\u201d\n\u201cYou know this\u2026thing?\u201d Qualan asks getting ready to attack.\n\u201cBriefly, he used to be one of the Paladins sent with me to take me back to the Empire.\u201d You reply backing away.\n\u201cAnd I still have to waste my time escorting you around!\u201d Salzat hisses. \u201cCome boy, my new master the Nightmare Tyrant wants to see you, it would be unwise to keep him waiting, the agony will only be much worse the more you resist\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTake the horse and ride boy! I\u2019ll dispatch this monster!\u201d Qualan shouts at you.\n\nYou\u2019re sick of running at this point, and Qualan needs your help. Besides you figure you can actually do something now with your new sword, which you draw out.\n\n\u201cBoy, I told you to get out of here!\u201d Qualan exclaims as he defends an attack from Salzat.\n\u201cHa ha! Good. Saves me the trouble of chasing down the little fool!\u201d Salzat laughs.\n\nWhile he\u2019s laughing you take the opportunity to stab at him. He attempts to dodge, but you manage to slightly wound his leg. This causes him to bellow in a hissing shriek. Qualan hits him with his axe, but it doesn\u2019t effect Salzat like your attack did. Salzat retreats back a bit to recover.\n\n\u201cYOU MISERABLE LITTLE WHELP! YOU HURT ME!\u201d he says before getting ready to charge again.\n\n\u201cBoy, your sword can hurt it, but I\u2019m better with wielding such a weapon, toss it to me and I\u2019ll dispatch this creature!\u201d Qualan quickly says bracing himself for another attack.", "action_results": [{"action": "Toss Qualan your sword", "result": "Following Qualan\u2019s advice that he would do a better job at fighting Salzat you toss the sword to him and he meets Salzat\u2019s charge.\n\nQualan lands what would look to be a powerful blow, but instead nothing happens! In fact you\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s stopped glowing. Salzat winces a bit from the hit, but he doesn\u2019t stop his own attack which fells Qualan. The sword flies out of his hand and disappears into thin air. It would appear that without your belief in yourself, the sword lost not only its power, but ceased to exist altogether. You attempt to wish for another, but you\u2019re too panicked to think straight and you\u2019re having a hard time concentrating altogether.

He\u2019s about to finish him off with his sword, but you prevent this from happening by stepping in and parrying the blow. For some reason, you feel much stronger than you ever have before.\n\n\u201cWhelp! You will be sustenance for the Shadow Tyrant!\u201d Salzat hisses and tries to break through your defense, but your confidence and sudden increase in strength don\u2019t make you fear his threats or him. Your sword glows brighter causing the red dots that are Salzat\u2019s eyes to close in blinding pain. While he temporarily shields them, you press your advantage and strike Salzat multiple times causing him to unleash an unholy scream before dissipating.\n\nYou\u2019re breathing hard after the battle, and you sit down to catch your breath. Qualan\u2019s regaining of consciousness makes you jump again.\n\n\u201cHey hold on there, it\u2019s just me! Wow, that really hurt.\u201d Qualan says holding on to his face. \u201cLooks like you took care of him yourself. In my tribe you\u2019d now be a man with all the benefits and respect as such. For defeating such a powerful creature you might even be considered an honorary great warrior. Here, take this.\u201d\n\nQualan gives you some sort of strange tooth. Its larger than a humans that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cA troll tooth. It\u2019s customary to take a trophy, but seeing as you fought a shadow, there is none, but you should have something to symbolize your hard earned victory, as well as possibly saving my life. Also know that you have made a permanent friend with no only me, but my entire tribe if you should ever meet them. It is our way.\u201d\n\nYou are filled with pride and pocket the tooth, while thanking Qualan.\n\nThe remainder of the night is uneventful. The next day, you and Qualan bump into a regal looking carriage making its way in the opposite direction. The driver looks annoyed that you\u2019re even on the same road as him, let alone in the way.\n\n\u201cHey you peasants! Get out the way! The Archmage is on very important business in the name of the Parran Empire!\u201d\n\nYour eyes immediately light up in hope.\n\n\u201cA wizard?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAn ARCHMAGE, peasant boy! And I told you and your barbarian servant to get out of the way!\u201d\n\u201cServant? I\u2019m NO ONE\u2019S servant! I am his friend!\u201d Qualan raises his voice in a tone which makes the driver flinch a little.\n\u201cErm\u2026well yes, but I still need you two to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDriver, what is the hold up here?\u201d an old wild haired man in a robe asks getting out of the carriage. \u201cWho are you lot?\u201d he then asks you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wizard from the Empire! And I need to get home! You have to help me!\u201d you blurt out handing the Archmage the note that the Captain gave you. He reads it and nods as you tell him the rest of your tale.\n\u201cHmm, you are a very lucky little boy. Not many get away from the Nightmare Tyrant, you must have a strong will.\u201d The Archmage says inspecting you. \u201cI sense that your sword isn\u2019t natural, yet I can\u2019t determine its magical origins. Yes, you DO have some sort of power boy. Ever thought of being a wizard? We could use someone like you against the Nightmare Tyrant.\u201d\n\nFor a brief fleeting moment your adventurous side almost jumps at the chance. But still, you don\u2019t want your Mom to worry about you anymore than she probably is right now. You still don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to tell her.\n\n\u201cNo, I want to go home.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cVery well, we can\u2019t have people here that don\u2019t want to be. I can teleport you back home right now if you wish. I myself don\u2019t like to use it for travel unless it\u2019s absolutely an emergency. I still prefer to take life slower and travel the old fashioned ways, of course that\u2019s not really an option for you being from another dimension and all.\u201d\n\u201cI can go right now?\u201d\n\u201cOh sure I can get you there real quick. And don\u2019t worry; the Nightmare Tyrant won\u2019t be able to ever steal you from your home world again. He\u2019s only able to perform that feat of interdimentional kidnapping once on a person. Hence the reason why he was so eager to get his hands on you before you could escape again. Now the problem is once I start to open the portal, you need to get going fast. It will undoubtedly alert the Nightmare Tyrant to this location where upon he\u2019ll try one last time to capture you. I\u2019ll certainly help, but this spell will be requiring most of my energy and concentration so hopefully your barbarian friend here will be able to fend off some of the Shadows. Since I\u2019m afraid my driver will most likely be hiding under the carriage the entire time.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d the driver says.\nQualan steps forward and nods.\n\u201cOf course. I will do everything in my power to help him get home.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, but that axe isn\u2019t going to do much good, let me enchant it first\u2026there. Now let\u2019s begin.\u201d\n\nThe Archmage begins to chant while you and Qualan wait for the spell to take effect. The driver looks nervous the whole time, but he hasn\u2019t hid under the carriage yet.\n\nThe wind begins to blow strongly and once again that familiar darkness begins gather once again. This time it\u2019s followed a stronger sense of malevolence.\n\nYou suddenly hear a menacing voice in your mind.\n\n\u201cBoy, did you think you could escape from me? I am the Nightmare Tyrant! Destroyer of life! Your power will be mine and you WILL serve me!\u201d\n\u201cNO!\u201d you scream out in defiance!\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen! It\u2019s the Tyrant\u2019s way of trying to get inside your head! Don\u2019t let him do it!\u201d the Archmage briefly shouts and then continues his hand gestures.\n\nShadow creatures come descending out of the sky screeching horribly as usual. Qualan stands in front of you ready to take the brunt of the attack.\n\n\u201cAlmost done!\u201d the Archmage shouts.\n\nThe shadows swarm your position, and you and Qualan attempt to fight them off. Your sword fortunately is glowing brightly, which at least keeps them from overwhelming you. While you and Qualan are fighting them off, the Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s voice booms from out of nowhere and clearly audible to everyone.\n\n\u201cFOOLS! Attack the wizard! He\u2019s the one who can create the escape portal!\u201d\n\u201cToo late Tyrant! Quick! Get in the portal!\u201d the Archmage commands as a blue portal opens up and he discharges lightning bolts from his fingers to destroy some Shadows attacking him.\n\u201cGo! We\u2019ll be alright! We can hold them off!\u201d Qualan adds.\n\nYou\u2019re sort of worried about Qualan, but you realize you have to go now. The Nightmare Tyrant bellows again to his minions about not letting you escape as you run for the portal and entering it.\n\nYou are enveloped by blackness followed by swirling colored lights. Your sword also flickers in and out of existence. It\u2019s all so strange and overwhelming to you that you pass out.\n\n\u201cHey! I told you breakfast is ready, are you going to sleep all day?\u201d you hear your Mom call from downstairs as you awaken in surprise.\n\nYou quickly look around your room and nothing looks out of place. Your Mom hasn\u2019t seemed to notice that you were gone, in fact it doesn\u2019t look like you even left.\n\nWas it all a dream?\n\nYou shake your head trying to decide if it was, then you notice a big tooth on the floor next to the toys you set up yesterday. The troll tooth and oddly its right next to a barbarian figure. Strangely it has a pleased look on their faces.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream. It was real. Created by the power of your own imagination.

We\u2019ll also be on the move a lot, so don\u2019t expect a high comfort level, however whenever we make camp, you\u2019re welcome to stay in my tent. For right now though, you\u2019ll have to leave it, I\u2019m having a meeting with Lyssia and a couple of my knights to discuss an important plan of action. Explore if you wish, but don\u2019t wander away from us, we\u2019ll protect you, but we won\u2019t baby-sit you.\u201d\n\nWith these words in mind Lyssia leads you back out of the tent, upon which another knight comes up to her with a message.\n\n\u201cSergeant, a man has arrived at the camp.\u201d\n\u201cIs he hostile?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he says he was just passing through and figured maybe he could trade for supplies here.\u201d\n\u201cTell him to move on, this isn\u2019t a trading post.\u201d Lyssia says and goes back in the tent.\n\nNot knowing what to do next you follow the knight back to the man he was talking about. When you see him, he looks raggedy, but well equipped. He a sword by his side and his leather armor looks more like a patchwork taken from several other suits. The most notable feature is the big backpack on his back. You wonder if he\u2019s an adventurer.\n\n\u201cAlright you, move on, this isn\u2019t a trading post.\u201d The knight repeats to the visitor.\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll go. But can\u2019t I just rest here for one minute? I\u2019ve been walking a lot and it would be nice to at least know I\u2019m safe for just a moment.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026well okay, but make it quick, and stay on the outskirts of the camp.\u201d The knight says and leaves. You continue to examine this traveler, who immediately knows you are.\n\u201cWell, how come you get to stay here? Army camps aren\u2019t known to house children.\u201d He asks while sitting down on a nearby log.\n\nYou explain your situation to this adventurer, and once again you get an unsurprised look from your listener.\n\n\u201cGot the impression you weren\u2019t from around here. I somehow could sense it. I always had that ability; it\u2019s come in handy a lot. But yes, the Nightmare Tyrant is very bad news; you would do well to leave this world as quickly as you can, no doubt Shadows are already on their way.\u201d\n\u201cWell I got this army to protect me!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cPerhaps, but you said it will be awhile before they return to the Parran Empire where you can get properly transported back to your world, in the meantime they WILL be attacked by not just Shadows, but also by whatever they come across in their mission. Tis a long time to put yourself at risk. Not to mention I see a lack of magic in this camp, I wonder about their chances against Shadows if the Nightmare Tyrant unleashes his full power in order to re-capture you.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re almost sorry you started talking to this man, within a few seconds he\u2019s managed to worry you all over again. Here you were thinking that you were going to be nice and safe.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026well what should I do?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if we were back in Null, I could probably get you back home really quick\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore the Adventurer can finish you interrupt.\n\n\u201cNull?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s where I live. It used to be a great city of fantastic magical power a long time ago, but it was destroyed by its own petty bickering. The powerful wizards there began to argue among themselves, factions were drawn and the entire city along with several miles around it went up in a big ball of flame. It was a terrible tragedy that could\u2019ve been avoided, but there was an interesting effect of the aftermath of it though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no magic works there now, hence the name Null. Powerful wizards can\u2019t get a simple cantrip to work there, let alone a spell. Even the Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s minions can\u2019t go there. Still, it\u2019s far from safe. Lots of the Forsaken live there.\u201d\n\u201cWho are the Forsaken?\u201d\n\u201cOh they\u2019re the unlucky folks who actually managed to survive the catastrophe. Not all of them bad, but understandably such a powerful magic disaster had an effect on most of their bodies as well as their minds.\u201d\n\nWhile this is all very fascinating, you still don\u2019t see how this helps you exactly.\n\n\u201cWhile this is all very fascinating, I still don\u2019t see how this helps me exactly. I mean if no magic works there, how can I get home? And why would you want to live in such a place anyway it sounds dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe Adventurer moves closer to you and looks around before speaking.\n\n\u201cOkay, because I can sympathize with being in a tough position, I\u2019ll tell you a little secret. Magic DOES work there, but only in one area and it\u2019s only a place I know about as far as I know. There\u2019s a deep, but small underground dungeon in Null where magic seems to work, I know because that\u2019s where I live! I stumbled upon it completely by accident when I was exploring Null. Apparently one of the many trinkets that I had acquired in the past was a key of some sort. It began to glow and then the wall opened up the way for me. Pure random dumb luck. So I went in and discovered that entire section runs on magic or something like it at least. There are some sort of contraption that if you sit down in and visualize with clarity, your wish will come true! I tried it a few times and it was nice, but I\u2019m a wanderer at heart and as such I couldn\u2019t just spend the rest of my days wallowing in eternal paradise, plus I was always leery that something bad might happen if I over used the contraption for greed. However I did see it as a good place to make my home away from the road. In fact I use this magic chair to quickly travel to towns and other cities, of course it\u2019s only one way, but at least it shortens the trip somewhat. You could probably use the chair to return home. Even if it doesn\u2019t work, I could always take you to the Parran Empire to get you back home. It would still be quicker and safer than traveling with an army that has to complete some mission before it can back home. Who knows what responsibilities and dangers it might incur along the way? Think also, in Null, you wouldn\u2019t be attacked by Shadows either. It\u2019s up to you though, but choose quickly because I have to be leaving soon.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with the Adventurer", "result": "You have to admit, even though you want to go back home, part of you really likes it here.

The Adventurer explains that you\u2019ll probably reach Null in a couple of days, but that you still shouldn\u2019t worry too much about Shadow attacks, since the anti-magic effects from Null are also in the desert wasteland surrounding the ruined city.\n\nAs you travel further, you find that the Adventurer is quite talkative. He speaks about his many journeys, he also mentions briefly of why he chose his \u201cprofession\u201d which was mainly because he was bored living in the small village where he was born. When you reach the desert you see a big ruined city far in the distance. You also notice night is starting to fall as it\u2019s starting to get dark, though it seems to have come on all of a sudden.

The real night will be coming soon and actually walking around in Null after night isn\u2019t particularly a safe thing to do either, the desert is a lot securer.\u201d\n\nYou and the Adventurer settle down for the night, he brings out some water flasks from his backpack and gives you one. You drink it all up and it\u2019s soon empty, but you still wish you had a lot more.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t drink all of it! We have to conserve it\u2026wait, I know that flask doesn\u2019t hold that much water.\u201d He says in confusion as you continue to drink what seems to be an endless supply of water in the flask. When you\u2019ve truly satisfied your thirst the Adventurer takes the flask and attempts to look in it and shake it and finds there\u2019s no more water in there.\n\n\u201cOkay how did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cHow did I do what?\u201d\n\u201cYou drank enough for two flasks! These aren\u2019t bottomless canteens of everlasting water either and even if they were they wouldn\u2019t work due to the anti-magic here. So I\u2019d like to know HOW you did that.\u201d\n\nThe Adventurer is looking at you suspiciously, almost as if you could possibly be dangerous. You stutter and fumble with an explanation mainly because you don\u2019t even know.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026I just wished I had more water\u2026I was really thirsty\u2026\u201d you reply a bit worried. He looks at you for a moment longer and then speaks again.\n\u201cTry to wish for a chest full of gold.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cJust do it, I want to see something.\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026okay.\u201d\n\nYou wish and think as hard as you can, but nothing happens. Well that\u2019s not entirely true, you get dizzy and fall to the ground. A single gold piece appears near you though. The Adventurer picks you up as well as the gold piece, which is somewhat misshapen and uneven.\n\n\u201cHmm, so there are limits. Did you always have this ability?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? No. We don\u2019t have any kind of stuff like this in my world.\u201d You say trying to keep steady.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what exactly is going on, but it would appear you got some sort of weird mental powers independent of magic. I have fought monsters with similar abilities, which is why I was suspicious at first. You ability reminds me of the magic chair I was telling you about except your power can work even in this anti-magical place and it would appear it isn\u2019t very powerful. I\u2019d almost suggest that you could attempt to wish yourself back home, but as we\u2019ve seen, it isn\u2019t powerful enough to do that. Still, this is probably a good indication that the chair will be able to get you back home. Here, here\u2019s a proper gold piece, I don\u2019t need it. Well anyway let\u2019s get some sleep, we should reach Null tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou pocket the faultless gold coin and the both of you go to sleep. Before you do though, you reflect on this little adventure. You also wonder about your Mom, she\u2019s going to be worried about you and probably have the police looking all over for you! And when you finally do return, what will you tell her?\n\nYou don\u2019t know, but what you do know for certain is that you DO want to get home as soon as possible even if you do find this place very fascinating.\n\nThe next morning the both of you wake up refreshed and ready to carry on your journey to Null. You don\u2019t get far, when the Adventurer senses someone is following you. You both turn around and see a figure approaching. It looks like a teenage boy, but deathly pale. The odd thing is, he\u2019s wearing modern clothing from YOUR world.\n\n\u201cIs that one of the Forsaken?\u201d you ask\n\u201cHim? No, if it was it would probably coming from Null not towards it, not to mention it would probably be running at us trying to eat us. It also looks too human and it\u2019s wearing strange clothing, in fact it looks more like\u2026well your type of clothing. Friend of yours?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I know of, I\u2019m not friends with anyone his age.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t quicken his pace; he just continues to walk steadily towards your position. When he gets close enough, you can see his face, which looks emotionless. In fact it looks like he\u2019s staring right through the both of you. The Adventurer draws his sword, but it doesn\u2019t look like this person is showing any sign of going to attack. In fact he just stands there looking off into space.\n\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s your name?\u201d the Adventurer demands.\n\u201cJohn\u2026Johnny Doe\u2026\u201d he replies still staring into the space. \u201cThis place\u2026it\u2019s dead\u2026numb\u2026like me\u2026\u201d\n\nAs odd as he is, something tells you he\u2019s from your world. Maybe he\u2019s another person the Nightmare Tyrant tried to capture.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to help him", "result": "You step forward towards him, an action that the Adventurer doesn\u2019t approve of at all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?!\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right, I think he\u2019s from my world. Maybe he escaped from the Nightmare Tyrant too.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust him, he\u2019s weird and in my line of work, if it\u2019s weird more often than not, it isn\u2019t good!\u201d\n\nYou ignore the Adventurer and go back to talking to Johnny, who seems to have begun to direct his attention towards you.\n\n\u201cAre you from Earth?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDid the Nightmare Tyrant bring you here?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDid you escape like me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThis answer catches you off guard, so much in fact that you don\u2019t react in time to jump out of the way of Johnny\u2019s grip. When he grabs your arm, you feel an instant paralyzing numbness causing you to drop immediately. When this occurs the Adventurer leaps into action and strikes Johnny, but when his sword hits Johnny\u2019s body, it\u2019s almost as if the paralysis crept up the sword and was inflicted upon the Adventurer as well. He falls to the ground clutching his arm and dropping his sword. Johnny follows up by merely touching the Adventurer on the head, completely immobilizing him.\n\nHaving incapacitated the Adventurer, Johnny turns his attention back to you.\n\n\u201cNo magic can work here, but I can. The Nightmare Tyrant wants to see you. You must comply. Perhaps you will become one of the Shadows. Maybe you will become like me. The Nightmare Tyrant will decide. He knows best.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to speak, but you\u2019re unable to. You can\u2019t even think.\n\n\u201cNo more talk. No more resistance. Just dead numbness.\u201d He says and then picks you up and begins to carry you out of the desert.

I get the impression that this guy doesn\u2019t know when to take a hint.\u201d He says picking up a rock and throwing it at the teenager. The rock hits him squarely in the head, it seems like it should\u2019ve knocked him out, but instead it just makes him stop and blink a few times before addressing you in a monotone voice.\n\n\u201cYou should not resist. You must come with me. The Nightmare Tyrant must be obeyed. He is\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Johnny can complete his sentence, the Adventurer strikes him with his sword, but a strange thing happens. The Adventurer drops his sword and falls to the ground, clutching his arm. It would seem a kind of paralysis has stricken the Adventurer.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d he yells trying to crawl away.\n\nWasting no time, you run towards Null. Johnny pays no more attention to the Adventurer and continues to follow you, but still doesn\u2019t quicken his pace. Whatever Johnny is, it\u2019s obvious his own powers are in full effect here too.

You also don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing since you\u2019ve never done this before!\n\nJohnny steadily approaches you as you just stand there concentrating really hard while you attempt this unusual plan. Suddenly something happens, he stops walking and your own mind is flooded with a lot of weird thoughts.\n\nYou don\u2019t understand all of it, but you get the impression he didn\u2019t have a good home life in your own world. He used to \u201cescape\u201d to a fantasy world a lot and presumably that\u2019s what attracted the Nightmare Tyrant. You attempt to reason with him, but the link is broken when he verbally shouts out!\n\n\u201cSTOP! Get out of my head! Only the Master is allowed! You MUST submit! He makes everything better! Shadows around me always. No pain, no pleasure, just nothingness\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJohnny, you\u2019re from the same place I am, don\u2019t you want to return home too?\u201d you retort.\n\u201c\u2026better here than what was at home\u2026at least here I have power\u2026and soon you will too. Isn\u2019t that why you came here, to escape the pain?\u201d\n\u201cNo! The Nightmare Tyrant kidnapped me! I want to go back home, my Mom\u2019s probably worried about me!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026mine probably forgot about me years ago\u2026yours will too\u2026you need to just submit\u2026the Nightmare Tyrant makes everything better\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNO! I will not! In fact I want you to stop following me! I want you to leave me alone altogether! You will NOT prevent me from going home! Johnny, you\u2019re nothing but a slave to the Nightmare Tyrant. Is that what you want? Somewhere within you, you must miss something about your home.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026better than home\u2026but\u2026\u201d\n\nOnce again you\u2019ve managed to stir some sort of emotion in Johnny. Suddenly he slumps to the ground and begins to weep. You\u2019re unsure of how to react, but you see the Adventurer staggering back towards you, which at least makes you somewhat relieved.\n\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to stay here; you could return back to Earth with me, all we have to do is\u2026\u201d\n\nJohnny looks up with red eyes, but has regained his composure.\n\n\u201cNo. I left Earth a long time ago. This is my home now. But I see now that I am still under a cruel\u2026guardian. No more. I want to be free\u2026 Arrgh!\u201d\n\nSuddenly Johnny grips his head, and you too feel a pain inside your own. A dark malevolent voice pieces your brain. It\u2019s the Nightmare Tyrant, somehow he\u2019s managed to speak to the both of you from wherever he is.\n\n\u201cDisobedient children! How dare you defy me Johnny! After all I have given you! Didn\u2019t I give meaning to your pathetic life? Didn\u2019t I become the parent you needed? If you won\u2019t obey me willingly then I\u2019ll just have to destroy what little free will I still allowed you to have! And YOU, oh I have special plans for you! Such power cannot be ignored and WILL supplement my own!\u201d\n\nWhile you and Johnny fall on the ground in pain, the Adventurer scoops you up and proceeds to run with you under his arm towards Null.\n\n\u201cHang on kid! Keep fighting whatever it is you\u2019re fighting, I\u2019ll get you to your destination, I haven\u2019t failed in a quest yet!\u201d he exclaims.\n\nIn the \u201creal world\u201d you fall unconscious, but in your mind you\u2019re very much awake. It would seem you\u2019re in some sort of dream world. You\u2019re standing on top of a rock floating in the void of blackness. You see Johnny in the distance standing on another rock fighting off Shadows which are attempting to drag him over the edge. He\u2019s punching them, but his fists are glowing with a white energy.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t follow your evil commands anymore! From now on, I shall fight you with the very power you gave to me and your Shadows can\u2019t stop me!\u201d He shouts as he completely destroys two Shadows at the same time with one blow of his fist. While you\u2019re watching this the Shadows have become aware of your presence and are climb over the edges of the floating rock.\n\n\u201cFight them off! Imagine yourself a powerful warrior! Or whatever you wish! The Nightmare Tyrant can\u2019t stop you power of your mind if it\u2019s strong enough!\u201d Johnny shouts over to you.\n\nYou do just that, you imagine yourself in armor with a sword. You feel your strength grow and your reflexes quicken.\n\n\u201cCool!\u201d you say and strike at the nearest Shadow, destroying it.\n\nThis battle continues for some time until it seems that the endless amount of Shadows have become too afraid to attack anymore. You hear the voice of the Nightmare Tyrant again.\n\n\u201cFOOLS! You think you\u2019ve won? I was just warming up! I will show you the personification of FEAR and of eternal darkness!\u201d\n\u201cYou always did talk to too much.\u201d Johnny says and summons up a bright blinding ball of light completely enveloping the entire area. You hear an unearthly bellow as you shield your eyes from the blinding light. When you open them again, you see Johnny standing before you.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGone forever? No, but he won\u2019t be bothering you ever again. Me? He will. But I\u2019ll be even more prepared for him for the next time we meet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still going to stay here?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I meant what I said that this is my home now, and there is nothing for me back on Earth. But now I see that the Nightmare Tyrant just used me for his own purposes, to help him in his ongoing hunt for more power. I need to stay to make things right again. Maybe even destroy him once and for all. I have to try, after all the evil he\u2019s caused and lives he\u2019s ruined. You should of course go back home, and be thankful for what you have there. Farewell and thank you for opening my eyes.\u201d\n\nSuddenly you wake up from a bed and you\u2019re in an unusually colorful room. You see a broom sweeping by itself pass you by. Jumping up from seeing such a thing, you notice the Adventurer sitting by a table polishing his sword.\n\n\u201cNow you wake up! You know I had to fight through ten Forsaken trying to eat us, with you under my arm and you didn\u2019t even blink! Fortunately I got us here though. So, what happened to you exactly?\u201d\n\nYou and the Adventurer swap stories about what you both experienced in your respective journeys and you both think that each of you had the easier time of it! After showing you some of the \u201ccool magical stuff\u201d in his home, you\u2019re ready to go back to your own. This entire world is very interesting, but you want to return.\n\n\u201cWell, I can certainly understand that. Like I said, I\u2019m a traveler, but I suppose even I get a longing to return home. Y\u2019know, maybe I\u2019ll go visit mine. My real one, not this place. They might even have forgotten all the mischief I used to cause there!\u201d the Adventurer laughs.\n\nThe Adventurer shows you the chair he was talking about. You instinctively feel a power coming from it. Not a magical one either, it\u2019s the same one you have. Perhaps it was a device to enhance such abilities? Perhaps it was a secret weapon involved in the destruction of this City? You don\u2019t know and the Adventurer doesn\u2019t either, all you know is you\u2019re hoping it will help you get home.\n\nSitting in the thing does make you a bit nervous as it resembles an electric chair, but you know you need to calm yourself of any sort of fear and doubt if you want to get back home. You bid goodbye to the Adventurer before attempting to concentrate and he mentions he\u2019ll stand by to help in case it looks like you\u2019re in trouble.\n\nYou are suddenly transported through a tunnel of blackness followed by swirling colored lights. It\u2019s all so strange and overwhelming to you that you pass out once again.\n\n\u201cHey! I told you breakfast is ready, are you going to sleep all day?\u201d you hear your Mom call from downstairs as you awaken in surprise.\n\nYou quickly look around your room and nothing looks out of place. Your Mom hasn\u2019t seemed to notice that you were gone; in fact it doesn\u2019t look like you even left.\n\nWas it all a dream?\n\nYou shake your head trying to decide if it was, then you notice a coin on the floor next to the toys you set up yesterday. A gold coin and oddly its right next to a sword wielding figure with a peculiar smile on his face.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream. It was real. Created by the power of your own imagination. You decide you\u2019ll keep this information to yourself though, since nobody would ever believe it!\n\nYou had an interesting adventure, but you\u2019re glad to be home and thankful for what you have in the real world you think as you go downstairs to eat.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Stick with the Captain", "result": "While this man seems to mean well, you\u2019re still hesitant to just go wandering off with a stranger.

I know because I found it myself while scouting, of course I didn\u2019t explore it in great detail since I figured it would be better to have extra help, but the markings are Zodan. The Zodan are no longer around due to an ancient forgotten war that lead to their downfall, but it\u2019s possible that remnants of their power still exists, possibly something we can use against the Nightmare Tyrant.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cWell we don\u2019t know.

A majority of it is purely mental hence why he is anxious to always absorb the fertile imaginations of children. The Zodan also dabbled in similar psionic activity, so maybe\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly a soldier comes running into the tent and you\u2019ve just noticed how dark its gotten outside.\n\n\u201cLyssia, we\u2019re being attacked by Shadows!

That would really help out a lot.\u201d Black Fang says.\n\u201cMaybe I could wish myself back home\u2026\u201d you say before Lyssia stops you.\n\u201cNo wait, don\u2019t do that. Your abilities while obviously powerful are probably not stable. For all you know you might end up in the middle of an ocean! The power of the mind can be very dangerous. The Zodan experimented with it and they\u2019re no longer around anymore. The Nightmare Tyrant wields mind power for evil purposes in his pursuit to conquer everything in his path. I suggest you don\u2019t over abuse your gift. Don\u2019t worry we will get you home eventually though.\u201d\n\nYou sure hope so, while you trust Lyssia, you really do want to get home. You can only imagine how worried your Mom is going to be and you really won\u2019t know what to tell her when you get back!\n\nIn the meantime you settle down to sleep. Lyssia does as well while Black Fang takes watch since Lyssia points out that he was sleeping all day. Fortunately the night is uneventful and when the morning comes you\u2019re on your way. Black Fang doesn\u2019t travel with you though; in fact he pads off into different direction.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Black Fang coming with us?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my pet if that\u2019s what you think. He\u2019s a free being allowed to come and go as he pleases, but he\u2019ll be around. He just prefers his own company for the most part. If we get into overwhelming trouble I have complete faith he\u2019ll be around to help. Anyway the Zodan ruins won\u2019t take as long to get to with just us traveling there. We\u2019ll be able to cover more ground and take paths that an army couldn\u2019t travel through.\u201d\n\nAs you and Lyssia travel, you and her exchange a bit of information about each others\u2019 respective worlds which you both find very interesting. You make a lot of progress in one day. So much that Lyssia mentions that you should reach the ruins by the next day. She says that she has orders to search the place as much as she can, and then return back to the Empire where you can get help from the wizards to send you back home. She hopes that the Captain and the rest of his soldiers are alright and will eventually reach the ruins themselves before she returns to the Empire. When night comes Black Fang makes his presence known again as you settle down to camp again.\n\n\u201cI feel I should warn the both of you that we aren\u2019t completely alone in these woods. There\u2019s something, possibly several things running around out there. Caught a glimpse of them a couple times, but they seem unnaturally quick.\u201d\n\u201cShadows?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, they would\u2019ve attacked already. Plus I can smell these things when they\u2019re close by. They might be able to stay out of sight, but they can\u2019t hide their scent. Smells rotten.\u201d\n\u201cI had a feeling that we were being watched, I never saw anything though.\u201d Lyssia replies.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been staying further away from you two. I think they\u2019ve been watching me a lot more. They probably think I\u2019m a greater threat\u2026and they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to see that you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Lyssia suddenly stops. \u201cOkay I heard that.\u201d\n\nYou heard it too and all three of you prepare yourselves. You also start to smell something bad like what Black Fang was talking about. Two demonic looking creatures come jumping down from the trees. One of them is much fatter than the other.\n\n\u201cWell there doesn\u2019t seem to be anymore point in hiding, I\u2019m pretty sure we can take them anyway.\u201d The thinner one says.\n\u201cUh huh, yeah. Um, Jarac which one are we supposed to take back to the Nightmare Tyrant?\u201d the fat one asks.\n\u201cHago, you really are an idiot, sometimes I wonder how we\u2019re even related. The boy you moron!\u201d\n\u201cI thought the Nightmare Tyrant only had Shadows working for him.\u201d You say out loud to Lyssia.\n\u201cOh the Nightmare Tyrant has many working for him, boy. However it seems that a new battle front has recently opened up and he has great need of them elsewhere, but fortunately we happened to be in the area\u2026 so here we are.\u201d\n\u201cSo the Nightmare Tyrant relies on half witted demons to do his work now?\u201d Black Fang growls.\n\u201cHey! Only my brother is half-witted! And for what he\u2019s going to do to you, he doesn\u2019t need to be very smart. Enough of this talk, let\u2019s get to it. Are you ready brother?\u201d\n\nHago doesn\u2019t even reply he just smiles with a toothy grin and advances towards Black Fang. Jarak focuses his attention on you, but naturally Lyssia stands in front of you.\n\n\u201cRun away pretty one if you value your existence, though I\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t.\u201d Jarak says and attacks. He\u2019s incredibly quick and manages to hit Lyssia and knock her to the ground. A quick glace sees that Black Fang is struggling with Hago.\n\nYou need to act now, you can\u2019t possibly fight either of the demons with just your weapon given how quick they are, but even they wouldn\u2019t be quick enough to fight the power of your mind\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Think of something to help your companions", "result": "You wish for something that could help Lyssia and Black Fang, and at first nothing seems to happen, but Jarek then notices something when he tries to grab you and you dodge out of the way.\n\n\u201cWHAT? I should\u2019ve caught you! No human can move that quickly, especially not a boy!\u201d\n\u201cJarek, I feel like something just sapped my\u2026UGH!\u201d Hago grunts as Black Fang claws him across the face. Lyssia also gets back up to strike Jarek across the chest. He reels backward and realizes he no longer has an advantage.\n\n\u201cOur powers are gone! RUN!\u201d Jarek shouts and runs off with Hago following behind. Black Fang pursues them.\n\n\u201cBlack Fang wait!\u201d Lyssia shouts and runs after him. Not wishing to be left alone, you follow Lyssia. You have a hard time keeping up, but after a short distance she stops when she sees Black Fang sniffing around a strange gray building. There are no windows, just a single door. It\u2019s actually quite tall; you can\u2019t believe you never saw it before even in this forest.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Lyssia asks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, but the two demons ran in there. I was tempted to go in, but considering this thing just materialized out of nowhere I thought discretion might be the better idea for once. It\u2019s completely featureless except for this small weird symbol on the door.\u201d\n\nLyssia tells you to stand back as she examines it.\n\n\u201cThis is Zodan! I saw these symbols in the ruins I briefly explored. We have to go in explore it If the Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s minions are in there, who knows what secrets the Nightmare Tyrant might gain? We certainly don\u2019t want him to get anymore powerful than he is!\u201d\n\nAt this point the thought of getting home is still in the back of your mind, but with all that has happened you can\u2019t help, but be caught up in this excitement even if a lot of it has been scary.\n\nYou all enter the building, which apparently is a lot bigger on the inside. All the rooms are lit and furnished, but again everything is a dull gray color, the furniture (Most of which looks like it comes from various time periods), the floors, the walls, all of it. Someone must\u2019ve really liked that color.\n\nBlack Fang easily tracks the demons by their smell; however you all can hear their voices anyway. They sound like they\u2019re arguing with someone. When you arrive in the room where they\u2019re located, you see strange machines and the two demons arguing with a ghostly figure.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?! Teleport this place! We gotta get out of here!\u201d Jarek shouts.\n\u201cThis place isn\u2019t your personal transportation system! I told you that this place uses up a lot of power and needs to recharge when it teleports. Not to mention you insisted on keeping this place invisible the whole time, didn\u2019t you think that was going to use up power? You two are just going to have to wait awhile, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d the ghost replies.\n\u201cArgh! If you weren\u2019t a ghost already, I\u2019d make you one! Okay Hago, check\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Jarek can give whatever order he was going to give, Black Fang and Lyssia attack. The two demons stand no chance without their enhanced speed. A couple of quick blows and both give other worldly shrieks before they burst into puffs of smoke and disappear. The ghost on the other hand just floats there observing it all.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re gone, they were really getting on my nerves. Never did like demons. Now what can I do for you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this place exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh just a relic of the past or the future depending on your outlook on life. It once was a mobile military base if you were looking for something a little more precise. Used for conquest and that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Zodan in nature isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lyssia says.\n\u201cYes, but a fat lot good it did them, considering they aren\u2019t around anymore, well not in the traditional sense anyway. I take it you\u2019re not minions of the Nightmare Tyrant then?\u201d\n\u201cDo we look like we are?\u201d Black Fang snarls.\n\u201cWell you might, furball especially with that attitude! But the other two certainly don\u2019t look the part, besides I know the Nightmare Tyrant turns children into Shadows. Nasty fellow. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.\u201d\n\u201cSo who are you and why are you working for the Nightmare Tyrant?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just a caretaker of this place and as such I\u2019m tied to it. I can\u2019t prevent someone from using it however they want, I\u2019m just here to make sure it doesn\u2019t fall into decay or get destroyed like so many of the other Zodan inventions. When the Nightmare Tyrant found this place he decided to use it to find other possible Zodan weaponry since this place can easily home in on other Zodan ruins. So far with little success as I said most Zodan equipment has lost all its power. Normally he has those mean little Shadows running around in this place chattering incessantly, but for whatever reason he put those two demons in charge. Guess he needed to reassign troops or something.\u201d\n\u201cHey I found a Zodan ruin not far from this forest, is that why those demons were here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, there was one located by me recently, but those demons aren\u2019t like the Shadows and their minds weren\u2019t as shall we say as sharp hence why we\u2019re here in the middle of the forest instead of closer to the desired location. While this place is magical in nature, it was primarily designed to run on the power of the mind. The Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s Shadows are all psionically linked to him so teleportation isn\u2019t a problem. Those demons couldn\u2019t focus on anything! Now you boy, I sense a great deal of mental focus in you. Your sword was created from your mind was it not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, I can see why the Nightmare Tyrant would want someone like you to add to his power.\u201d\n\u201cCan this place take me home?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThis place needs time to recharge as those demons used up much of its energy with their bumbling. However, you could probably take yourself home. This place enhances the powers of the mind. Normally I wouldn\u2019t advise it since as I said it requires discipline, but you seem to have a natural gift at it and would probably be successful. Just visualize your home and concentrate.\u201d\n\nIt seems so simple! You wonder if you could\u2019ve done it all along, but that hardly matters, since you can do it now. Lyssia puts her hand on your shoulder.\n\n\u201cWell, it looks like you\u2019ll get home quicker after all.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for protecting me from the Shadows and demons.\u201d You tell her.\n\u201cHey you helped in both battles.\u201d She says.\n\u201cOh and what did I do, sit around and watch?\u201d Black Fang remarks to the both of you.\n\nYou nearly laugh and thank Black Fang too. The Caretaker then speaks.\n\n\u201cOkay, now I advise complete quiet when you attempt this. It\u2019s better for concentration and noise won\u2019t distract you. So your friends will have to remain quiet. I\u2019d advise that they leave altogether, as even their random thoughts could interfere. As I said, the chaos of the mind is one of the reasons for the downfall of the Zodan. I\u2019m a ghost so you need not worry about me.\u201d\n\u201cFine! Fine! I know when I\u2019m not wanted I\u2019ll go wait outside!\u201d Black Fang says and lopes off. Lyssia is about to leave too, but you insist that she stay because you feel safer with her around. After seeing that you really want her to stay she does and says she\u2019ll wish for you to get home as well.\n\nYou sit in the middle of the room and close your eyes and concentrate. You visualize your home. You see it. You can almost feel it. You\u2019re there, until\u2026\n\n\u201cLYSSIA!\u201d Black Fang roars as he runs into the room.\n\u201cI told you the boy needs to concentrate and silence!\u201d the Caretaker snaps.\n\u201cShut up ghost! Shadows are outside! A whole mess of them!\u201d\n\nLyssia and Black Fang quickly run out of the room. Lyssia shouts at you to continue to your concentration.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue to concentrate for home", "result": "You were close last time to getting home, you can\u2019t stop now.

You see your house, then various people you\u2019ve encountered, then this place, then total blackness\u2026\n\n\u201cHE\u2019S HERE! GET HIM GET HIM SSSSSS!\u201d you hear a Shadow hiss before you are transported, but it isn\u2019t to where you wanted\u2026\n\nWhen you open your eyes and see nothing but darkness and you are being held down on some sort of smooth cold surface by Shadows and you no longer have your sword.

You waste no time and begin shooting them with your new weapon.\n\n\u201cHa ha! Back to the void Shadow scum!\u201d Black Fang laughs when he see you helping.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of them coming in from the left!\u201d Lyssia shouts and suddenly you all hear a booming voice.\n\n\u201cFOOLS! You think you can stop me and take what is rightfully mine? You cannot defeat me! And YOU boy! Your powers are nothing compared to my own, its time that you see what REAL mental power can achieve!\u201d\n\nSuddenly the lighting gets much dimmer, almost to the point of complete darkness. Fortunately your powers maintain their glow making you the proverbial shining beacon of light. Suddenly more Shadows pour in from the corners of the walls. You\u2019re surrounded. However, help comes in the form of the very building you\u2019re in\u2026\n\n\u201cNightmare Tyrant you have attacked this structure and as I am bound to defend it, you have made yet another enemy!\u201d the Caretaker ghost exclaims and the entire building gets brighter, blinding most of the Shadows.\n\n\u201cGet \u2018em while they\u2019re weak! I\u2019m using all the power that this structure recharged right now!\u201d\n\nYou, Lyssia and Black Fang destroy more Shadows than you can count, but they still keep coming. You can\u2019t believe it. You\u2019ve got a lot in your favor except numbers, if you just had that, maybe you could finally defeat these Shadows once and for all\u2026\n\nOnce again it would seem your wishes have come true.\n\n\u201cBack to the void! Forward men!\u201d a familiar voice shouts. It sounds like its coming from outside.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Captain!\u201d Lyssia exclaims as she strikes down another Shadow.\n\u201cBout time we got some help here!\u201d Black Fang growls.\n\nThe battle is going badly for the Shadows who aren\u2019t attacking so much as they\u2019re trying to get away right now. The Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s voice again is heard and filled with rage.\n\n\u201cCOWARDS! FIGHT OR YOU\u2019LL SUFFER FOR YOUR FAILURE!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no use though; even his threats can\u2019t motivate the Shadows to victory. You can somehow sense that the Nightmare Tyrant is desperate for victory because if he can\u2019t get you now, he won\u2019t be able to get you ever again. Eventually all of them are defeated. You, Lyssia and Black Fang meet the Captain outside who has a handful of his original army left.\n\n\u201cHow did you find us?\u201d\n\u201cWell after we beat back the first Shadow attack we regrouped and headed towards the ruins as planned. Then we saw this tall gray structure looming in the distance so we head towards it, and found more Shadows, so finding you was somewhat pure chance! Well it looks like some of you have underwent some changes\u2026\u201d the Captain says when he sees you with your armor, sword and crossbow.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to discuss about this structure Captain, but first he has to use it to get home.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019m interested in hearing your report Lyssia.

It\u2019ll take me forever to fix this place again. Oh well, I suppose that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. So, are you ready to go now? I trust the fighting is over?\u201d\n\nYou nod and get ready to concentrate again, but before you do, Lyssia gives you something.\n\n\u201cHere, this is medal I was awarded for bravery in battle. I\u2019ve been awarded many actually, but I feel your actions were certainly deserving of such a medal. So this is for you.\u201d she says and then gives you the medal and hugs you goodbye.\n\nCherishing the gift, you prepare for your trip home, and concentrate once again. Soon you can feel yourself being transported.\n\nYou float through a tunnel of blackness followed by swirling colored lights.

I told you breakfast is ready, are you going to sleep all day?\u201d you hear your Mom call from downstairs as you awaken in surprise.\n\nYou quickly look around your room and nothing looks out of place. Your Mom hasn\u2019t seemed to notice that you were gone; in fact it doesn\u2019t look like you even left.\n\nWas it all a dream?\n\nYou shake your head trying to decide if it was, then you notice a medal on the floor next to the toys you set up yesterday. The medal is next to three figures: A man in plate armor, a black wolf and finally a warrior woman in leather armor and strangely they all have a look of victory in their faces.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream. It was real. Created by the power of your own imagination.

You could escape from it, but you then remember all the Shadows are outside waiting for you in the first place, in fact you can hear their screeching surrounding the house.\n\nA Shadow breaks in the window just as Chargrum bashes the door open and you begin to wish you were anywhere, but here!\n\nNo sooner have you thought that, you find yourself in front of Melcar, surprising the pair of you! From the looks of things, you\u2019re in a basement, or lab. You know you\u2019re underground, because you can see there is a stairway leading up and hear Chargrum\u2019s voice coming from above. He\u2019s screaming actually.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026where did you come from?\u201d Melcar asks.\n\u201cI\u2026I dunno! I was running from Chargrum and hiding and then I wished I was someplace else and then I found myself here!\u201d\n\u201cWait. Why was he chasing you?\u201d\n\u201cHe was trying to throw me to the Shadows!\u201d\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when Stinky comes running down the stairs.\n\n\u201cThe Shadows are in the house and they took away Chargrum through one of the windows!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! I just erected a barrier! They shouldn\u2019t be able to get in!\u201d\n\u201cWell a few of them have, and Argh! Here they come!\u201d Stinky says as some Shadows come down the stairs hissing and screeching. He quickly runs towards the both of you and behind Melcar.\n\n\u201cGet behind me too, kid.\u201d\n\nA few chants and Melcar unleashes a couple of electrical blasts from his fingers zapping all of the attacking Shadows. They give one last screech before disappearing.\n\nMelcar immediately rushes upstairs to see if there are anymore Shadows, you and Stinky follow closely behind him. After some checking, it would appear that the rest of the Shadows have been kept out and only a few managed to get in before the barrier appeared. You can still hear them still trying to get in though.\n\n\u201cWhew. Okay. That should hold for awhile.\u201d Melcar says collapsing in his chair.\n\u201cBut what about Chargrum\u2026the Shadows\u2026they\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything. They got him and that\u2019s it. But judging by what the kid told me he was trying to do it sounds like he got what he deserved anyway. Besides, I would\u2019ve thought you of all people would\u2019ve been glad to be rid of him, with the way he treated you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026guess so, but what\u2019re we going to do now?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cDunno yet, but I\u2019m hoping the kid can help out. If he can like I think he can; then we should be fine.\u201d\n\nNow both of you are looking at Melcar wondering what he\u2019s talking about. He sees that he\u2019ll need to explain in more detail.\n\n\u201cKid, as I said you were brought here by the Nightmare Tyrant due to your strong sense of imagination. However, judging from your recent transportation trick it would appear that your imagination is strong enough to cause things to happen with the mere power of your mind. Yet, it would also appear that your power is limited. You wished you were away from danger, yet only re-appeared in another place in the house. Though my magic barrier was up at that point, so perhaps that has something to do with it. I don\u2019t know\u2026let\u2019s test something.\u201d\n\nMelcar points to another chair.\n\n\u201cConcentrate, and think about that chair being solid gold.\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure about all of this, but you\u2019re interested in this \u201cnew power\u201d you\u2019ve acquired so you comply. Perhaps you could try to even wish yourself back home!\n\nYou close your eyes, concentrate and wish for the chair to be solid gold, but it\u2019s more difficult than you thought. Your mind is periodically bombarded with images of darkness and grinning Shadows. Eventually you fall to the floor. Melcar helps you up. The chair is still the same, except it has a single gold piece on the seat. Melcar checks to see if it\u2019s real, and then he pockets it.\n\n\u201cWell, just as I thought, it\u2019s unpredictable and weak right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026saw Shadows and darkness\u2026\u201d you say still holding your head.\n\u201cIt looks like the Nightmare Tyrant really wants you; he\u2019s probably linked to you psychically or something. I wouldn\u2019t try to use your power to try to get back home. You\u2019re likely to appear right in his clutches, but if we harness your power a little better, we can at least get rid of this immediate threat of Shadows. Focus on immediate help right now rather than a long term\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly Melcar is struck in the back of the head, by a Shadow! It must\u2019ve still been hiding during the search! Melcar collapses and falls. Stinky runs off, leaving the Shadow to turn its attention towards you, hissing aggressively.", "action_results": [{"action": "Use your power to try to escape", "result": "You attempt to wish yourself elsewhere again, but you failed to heed the warning given by Melcar who stated how such an action might be dangerous, and in this case it was\u2026\n\nYour mind is once again flooded by darkness and Shadows filling you with terror, and causing you to feel pulled towards it. A sinister laugh echoes throughout your head causing you to immediately break your concentration, but the damage is done as you are captured by the Shadow that\u2019s currently in the room with you. At this point your mind is too paralyzed with fear to be of any use, but it knocks you out just to be sure you don\u2019t try to escape again.\n\nThen it, along with its fellows takes you to meet the Nightmare Tyrant, whose laughter you hear once more before he carries out his evil plans for you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Use your power to fight back", "result": "You have to fight back, as escape is not an option. You don\u2019t even concentrate; you just wish you had something to defeat this creature!\n\nSuddenly a glowing sword appears in your hand. You also feel somewhat different, as if you have been trained to use one before. The Shadow steps back a bit, but then attack anyway. You take one swing at it and strike a powerful blow causing it to completely disappear.\n\nYou hear more coming in from the second floor again. The barrier must be weak in that area. Seeing as Melcar\u2019s out of it, you\u2019re going to have to reinforce it yourself.\n\n\u201cStinky! Stop hiding and try to bring Melcar back around so he can help! I\u2019m going to get rid of these Shadows!\u201d you order as you run upstairs.\n\nMore Shadows are eager to carry out the will of their master, but you\u2019re better prepared for them now physically as well as mentally. You strike down the first one coming down the hallway, and then the second one, and then the next, until you get back to the bedroom that you teleported from. You can see that the same window that the Shadows broke through before is where the barrier is also \u201cbroken\u201d. The blue glow of the magic barrier is non-existent there.\n\nBefore more Shadows can get in, you begin to wish for the barrier to be repaired. While you attempt this task, you begin to hear the taunts of the Shadows trying to fill you with doubt. You also hear a more sinister voice, one that carries fear directly to your mind.\n\n\u201cLittle fool! Do you actually think this is going to stop me? Your attempts only delay the inevitable. Eventually you WILL be mine!\u201d\n\nThis evil presence in your mind causes you to break your concentration. You\u2019re a little shaken by hearing the voice of the Nightmare Tyrant and you\u2019ve failed to repair the barrier and now more Shadows are climbing in. Fortunately, Melcar has regained consciousness and has appeared to help.\n\nMelcar zaps the Shadows and with a few mumbling chants the barrier is repaired. Before you thank him, you notice that he\u2019s soaking wet.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know, I\u2019m all wet. Stinky nearly drowned me in his attempt to wake me up. Pity he doesn\u2019t immerse himself in as much water! Still, I guess it worked.\u201d Melcar replies.\n\n\u201cI heard the Nightmare Tyrant\u2019s voice in my head.\u201d\n\u201cNot surprised. He\u2019s probably trying to prevent you from using your power. He\u2019s able to focus in on you better because you\u2019ve been in the same location for a long time. I\u2019d suggest moving, but given that we\u2019re surrounded by Shadows, that\u2019s not really an option anymore.\u201d\n\u201cLook, can\u2019t YOU just send me back home? I mean that\u2019s what you said you\u2019d do if I had cleared your backyard.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah\u2026about that. I was just kind of being lazy. I just didn\u2019t want to be bothered to do it. In fact I had a list of other chores I was going to have you do if you finished that one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!? You lied? You mean your wife was right about you being a charlatan?\u201d\n\u201cAM I NOT! I AM a wizard! I erected this barrier didn\u2019t I? Though maybe my wife is right about one thing, I am lazy. (Sigh) I guess I\u2019m paying for my sloth now. If I\u2019d just cleared out the backyard myself, instead of having you do it, the Shadows wouldn\u2019t have arrived. Bah, no time to worry about the past now, we need to solve this problem. Okay, I\u2019ll try to get you back home, without you around, the Shadows won\u2019t be around either. I know I have some sort of portal spell in one of my books somewhere. I\u2019ve never had any reason to use it before though and those types of spells are very taxing. I would definitely have to take down the barrier first and of course you know what that means and I still don\u2019t know if the spell will be successful, like I said I\u2019ve never cast one before.\u201d\n\u2018Is there anything we can do to slow down the Shadows?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cWell, we can barricade the house properly before I take the magic barrier down which will take us some time, but it\u2019s safer. We\u2019ll have to hope the Shadows don\u2019t break in quickly though. The second way is if we actually try to destroy all the Shadows currently out there, before I start the portal spell. In this case we\u2019ll have to hope that the Nightmare Tyrant can\u2019t summon reinforcements quick enough.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Barricade the house", "result": "You might have new abilities, but they\u2019re still limited. Fighting a bunch of Shadows is just going to tire you and Melcar out and Melcar needs all of his energy to cast the portal spell.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s barricade the house.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAlright, but I have to look for that spell first, so you\u2019ll be doing most of the barricading. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t take me too long.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well maybe I can get Stinky to help me.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea, I would imagine he\u2019ll be able to at least be useful in that aspect. Make sure you stay focused and block out any of those Shadow tricks or anything the Nightmare Tyrant might try to do to your mind.\u201d\n\nYou take Melcar\u2019s advice and go talk to Stinky. He\u2019s still in a state of panic, and gibbering about the Shadows trying to get in.\n\n\u201cHey, help me barricade the house.\u201d\n\u201cBut what good will that do? Trapping ourselves in won\u2019t help! They\u2019ll get in eventually!\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve got a plan so that the Shadows won\u2019t bother you ever again, but I need you to pull it off and that involves you helping me barricade the house! You\u2019re braver than you think Stinky, look at me, I didn\u2019t think I could fight the Shadows either and I did.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t have any powers like you do and Chargrum always said that I was too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cChargrum isn\u2019t around anymore to abuse you, so his opinion doesn\u2019t matter, in fact it never did. You\u2019re better off not thinking about anything he might\u2019ve said about you. You can do this. Now\u2019s the time to prove yourself.\u201d\n\nYour inspiring words make Stinky feel more confident in himself, probably for the first time in his life. He immediately thanks you, and begins to help you barricade the house. You spend a whole day doing this mainly because Melcar has a really hard time finding anything in his disorganized lab. You mainly focus on the task at hand as does Stinky, but your thoughts briefly wander about your home. If\u2026no WHEN you get back home, you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to explain your disappearance to your Mom. You can\u2019t dwell on such things too much though, you need to keep yourself alert.\n\nEventually Melcar comes back up from his lab.\n\n\u201cFound it. Now I\u2019m going to go back down into the basement and begin the spell because it\u2019ll be the safest place I\u2019ll be able to cast it. I hope your barricades are strong enough to hold because I won\u2019t be able to fight Shadows AND cast this spell. If the Shadows do manage to break in, well its going to be up to you to fight them off.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me\u2026\u201d Stinky pipes up.\n\u201c\u2026well, this is a surprise. Okay, the both of you then, here Stinky you\u2019ll need something magical to fight them.\u201d Melcar hands Stinky a wand of some sort. \u201cMake the shots count, because I forget how many charges it has left in it. Okay I would suggest you two guard the basement doorway and when I tell you the portal is open that will be your cue to make haste into it, because again, I don\u2019t know how long I can keep it open. You guys ready?\u201d\n\nYou and Stinky nod.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to dispel the barrier.\u201d\n\nMelcar makes a few chanting noises and the barrier goes down where upon you hear the Shadows howling in excitement and start trying to bash their way in. You all retreat back to the basement, where you and Stinky prepare yourselves for an attack and Melcar begins to cast the Portal Spell.\n\nAll seems to be going smoothly, but then you hear the inevitable break in, and the first Shadows attempt to recapture you. Fortunately you\u2019re in a good position to fight them. They can\u2019t overwhelm or sneak up on you. After striking a few down, a smaller Shadow appears and sounds painfully familiar\u2026\n\n\u201cYOU did this to me! Now I\u2019ll do what I wanted to do in the first place! Throw you to the Nightmare Tyrant!\u201d Chargrum hisses in his new Shadow form.\n\nYou take a swing at Chargrum, but you miss and end up falling off balance causing you to fall down the steps! You\u2019re hurt, and very dizzy, but you can see Stinky trying to fight off Chargrum. He discharges a bolt from the wand, but once again Chargrum proves to be very nimble in his new form and knocks it out of his hand and him to the floor.\n\n\u201cOutta the way Stinky! When ya get turned into one of us, I\u2019ll make sure to really punish you, for you traitor!\u201d\n\nChargrum races down the stairs towards you, just as you see Stinky getting swarmed by other Shadows at the top of the stairs. You roll out the way of Chargrum\u2019s clutches and pick your sword back up.\n\n\u201cBetter put down those Shadows quickly! I\u2019m not near done yet!\u201d Melcar shouts from his own position after seeing you engaged in combat with Chargrum.\n\nYou strike down a couple more Shadows, but Chargrum continues to prove to be faster. He manages to knock you down again and jumps on top of you as your sword is separated from you.\n\n\u201cThe Nightmare Tyrant wants to relay a message to you!\u201d he hisses and you feel the sinister voice of Tyrant entering your mind again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lost! You cannot defeat me, I am everywhere. You WILL submit and become my servant!\u201d\n\nThe Nightmare Tyrant is attempting to break your will and fill you with terror again, but it\u2019s not going to work this time, you can feel that victory is almost near and the Tyrant probably feels it too. He knows that if you get away back to your own world that he\u2019ll never be able to try to get you ever again. You won\u2019t be beaten after coming this far, all you need is a distraction to help you get your sword back and Chargrum off of you\u2026\n\nAnd with that thought in mind, Stinky comes from out of nowhere and zaps Chargrum point blank in the back with his wand. He screeches horribly as he disappears before your eyes.\n\n\u201cShould\u2019ve watched your back around a traitor like me, Chargrum.\u201d Stinky smirks as you scramble to retrieve your sword.\n\nYou strike down a few more Shadows, and try to hold them back at the bottom of the stairway. Stinky\u2019s wand has run out of charges, but the better news is that Melcar has completed the portal spell! A large blue portal opens up. Now you can hear the Nightmare Tyrant very clearly.\n\n\u201cNO! GET THE BOY! NOW!\u201d he roars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s open! Get in quick! I don\u2019t know how long it will hold!\u201d Melcar shouts.\n\n\u201cGo! We\u2019ll be alright! We can hold them off!\u201d Stinky adds.\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave you without a weapon!\u201d you shout and hand Stinky the sword, at which point he hands you the used up wand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much, but think of it as a souvenir! Thanks for your help!\u201d he shouts as fights off more Shadows coming down the stairs.\n\nYou run towards the portal and give Melcar a look before jumping in.\n\n\u201cStinky\u2019s right, we\u2019ll be fine, though I\u2019m sure my wife will yell at me for destroying half the house! Get in!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re sort of worried about Stinky and Melcar, but you realize you have to go now. The Nightmare Tyrant bellows again to his minions about not letting you escape as you run for the portal and entering it.\n\nYou are enveloped by blackness followed by swirling colored lights. It\u2019s all so strange and overwhelming to you that you pass out.\n\n\u201cHey! I told you breakfast is ready, are you going to sleep all day?\u201d you hear your Mom call from downstairs as you awaken in surprise.\n\nYou quickly look around your room and nothing looks out of place. Your Mom hasn\u2019t seemed to notice that you were gone; in fact it doesn\u2019t look like you even left.\n\nWas it all a dream?\n\nYou shake your head trying to decide if it was, then you notice a small rod on the floor next to the toys you set up yesterday. It\u2019s the used up wand and oddly it\u2019s right next to a couple of figures, one holding a sword and another with his hands positioned to cast a spell. They strangely have a tired, but yet relieved look on their faces.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream. It was real. Created by the power of your own imagination.

Melcar eventually exhausts his spell power and is reduced to beating the Shadows with a magic wand. You briefly worry about him being able to cast the portal spell, but as it turns out, that will be the least of your worries.\n\nA shorter Shadow suddenly jumps on your back; it begins to taunt you as it attempts to wrestle you down.
