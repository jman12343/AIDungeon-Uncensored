He studied hard in school and his parents supported his dreams for he was intelligent and hard working and they knew he could succeed if given the chance. They also wanted him to have a more stable and comfortable life than they did. (Much like their parents before them)\n\nDespite the high costs of a formal education of a person growing up in his middle class background, his parents who ran an inn, scraped together enough money to send him to a university and for awhile the young man was able to pursue his dreams.\n\nUnfortunately life doesn\u2019t always go as planned and one day the young man\u2019s father died and to make matters worse it turned out his father who only had the best intentions for his son, had been borrowing from a dangerous loan shark.\n\nWith his mother in danger of losing the inn, the young man had to put his dreams on hold and help his mother. It was a time of great stress for the young man, but in time he was able to not only keep the inn afloat and pay off the debt, but he was also able to turn enough profit to re-enroll at the university and eventually become the doctor he always wanted to be.\n\nDuring his time as an innkeeper however, he had become very close to a young barmaid by the name of Eliza. While their love didn\u2019t blossom immediately, he soon realized his feelings before it was too late and the two became romantically involved and in time they married.\n\nFor various reasons together they moved away from the city and to a quieter smaller town called Teckleville. There the young man opened a private practice and became a respected member of the community and had twins with Eliza.\n\nThese twins, a boy and a girl, had possibly even more of a loving home than their father did and they certainly had even more comforts and advantages. Truly when they grew up, they could be anything they set their minds to.\n\nHowever, once again life is not always so simple.\n\nAs they grew up, these twins became the scourge of Teckleville, always getting into mischief. Granted some misbehavior is expected from youth as they find their purpose in life, but it would seem no matter what, these two were bound and determined to pursue the life of crime.\n\nThe pair of them rogues through and through and as they got older it was apparent they had no desire to change.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where our tale begins\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Year 16\n\nAs you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your twin sister is watching you with a slightly distracted expression. She\u2019s been looking like that a lot lately.\n\nYou know she can\u2019t be concerned about getting into trouble. The pair of you have been doing this since you were kids. You\u2019ve got this routine down pretty well at this point.\n\nWhile most of your small town is fully aware of your roguish ways, you\u2019re fortunate that you\u2019re both still young and your father is a good doctor and has some measure of influence in keeping you out of the local jail. Plus, it helps that you long since stopped stealing from the town itself and focused on stealing from people passing through Teckleville instead.\n\nStill, it isn\u2019t like either of your parents are pleased with your recreational criminal activities and have tried to steer you in a different direction with little success. While it tends to go in one ear and out the other with you, sometimes your sister listens occasionally.\n\nAnd you\u2019re pretty sure that\u2019s the cause of her distraction in-between your jobs. Something is on her mind and has been for a while now and today is the day she says as much.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk bro.\u201d your sister says.\n\u201cUh oh. You sound like mom. Which means this doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI really wish you wouldn\u2019t set a negative tone to this already difficult situation. I\u2019ve been going back and forth about this multiple times, making myself sick over it actually.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\n\nYou sister exhales deeply and sits next to you.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me in this town.\u201d\n\u201cGee thanks, sis.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, I just\u2026(Sigh) look I know you don\u2019t listen to mom or dad, but I\u2019ve been thinking they\u2019ve got a point. I mean, what am I doing? What are WE doing? I mean when we were little kids, this was fun. Working together in near perfect harmony and avoiding trouble, but we\u2019re both sixteen now. We really going to be doing this for another sixteen years?\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing this straight out of the womb, sis.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I mean! What does the future hold for us? How long before dad just gets fed up and tells the town guard to throw us in jail for our own good?\u201d\n\u201cMom, wouldn\u2019t allow that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I think even mom has her limits. Besides, neither one may have a choice in protecting us, if we really fuck up one day.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re too good at this, we\u2019re not going to fuck up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, even if that is the case, I don\u2019t see staying here in Teckleville robbing travelling merchants as a stable future.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m getting out. I\u2019m leaving town.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re silent for a moment. You knew that\u2019s where this was heading, but hearing it makes it real.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to go?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. Anywhere! Maybe Klyton, or Holgard or even the Delantium Kingdom. I\u2019ll figure it out during my travels. Just anywhere, but here.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And just how exactly are you going to support yourself?\u201d\n\u201cHalf of that stuff we steal is mine you know.\u201d Your sister points out.\n\u201cYeah, I know that, but that\u2019s not going to last forever and it isn\u2019t that much.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell mom has always stressed how nice my voice is and how creative I am. And I think you know I\u2019ve been practicing my lute a lot more lately. I figured I might be a bard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA bard?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know. Singing tales, telling stories and getting into adventures\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026okay\u2026Yes, you\u2019ve got many talents. I mean it\u2019s why we work so well together. You distract folks with your charm and I do the rest. I\u2019ve always known that and I get that you\u2019ve always liked the attention you get from the marks more than the actual thievery. But I thought you said you were seeking a more stable future. Being a wandering bard doesn\u2019t exactly qualify.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, maybe stable wasn\u2019t the right word, maybe DIFFERENT was more accurate. My point is, this is something I want to do and I can\u2019t be a proper bard unless I travel and experience the world! I can\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201d\n\nYour sister is quite serious about this and you know that there is going to be no deterring her from this path. This is going to change everything, but you\u2019re willing to roll with it.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026okay I suppose if this is something you want to do, I\u2019ll have to support it. You\u2019re probably right about sticking around here anyway, I know I get pretty bored in between waiting for the next mark. I assume you\u2019re probably already getting ready to leave soon. Just let me get my things together and I\u2019ll be ready\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot this time. I\u2019m going by myself.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re really surprised.\n\n\u201cWhat?! But you can\u2019t! I mean\u2026who\u2019s going to look out for you? Don\u2019t you know how dangerous it is out there?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cHow would you know? You\u2019ve never left this town either!\u201d your sister points out.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve heard things!\u201d\n\u201cAnd so have I. Look\u2026I\u2019m well aware that it isn\u2019t a safe world out there, but that\u2019s part of what I need to experience. I mean even here, with that overly aggressive asshole Klint hitting on me every other day, I know I\u2019m safe from him because you, mom and dad are around.\u201d\n\nYour sister continues.\n\nLook, I need to do this on my own. I need to fail or succeed on my own. I need to take care of myself, I mean don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve got the skills to do it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026I dunno\u2026I guess it\u2019ll just be sort of strange. We\u2019ve been a team for so long.\u201d\n\u201cI know. It\u2019ll be strange for me too since we\u2019re so close, but maybe this will be for the best anyway. I mean have you heard some of more recent ugly rumors about us just because we\u2019re twins?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sort of twisted where people\u2019s minds go. (Sigh) I guess this is goodbye. Are you leaving tonight, are you telling mom and dad?\u201d\n\u201cYes, as you correctly guessed I will be leaving tonight. As for telling mom and dad, I thought about it\u2026but I can only imagine the chaos that might cause with mom getting weepy and dad forbidding me to go anywhere. Hell, he might actually have the town guard throw me in jail just so I\u2019d have to stay! No, better just leave a note and take off in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cProbably the safest bet for you. Though of course you realize I\u2019m going to catch the fallout of this plan of yours. In fact I\u2019ll probably somehow get blamed for it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you will\u2026apologies.\u201d Your sister says.\n\u201cMeh, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll muddle through like I always do.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know you could leave too. I mean not with me of course, but you\u2019re a resourceful guy, I\u2019m sure you could make it outside this one horse town too. You did say you get bored here.\u201d Your sister says.\n\u201cYeah, but I dunno. I\u2019m not exactly multi-talented as you are and I doubt if I\u2019d be able to try my hand at a life not involving crime somehow. Plus, here I\u2019m probably the best thief in town. Elsewhere? I\u2019m probably an amateur that would get eaten alive by the bigger criminals. Besides, I still got a good thing going here. I admit though it\u2019s not going to be the same without your help.\u201d\n\nYour sister pats you on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Just remember what I said. You\u2019ve got more talent than you think and you could definitely do well out there too.\u201d\n\nMaybe there is some truth to that, but in any case, this is where you part ways with your blood partner in crime. You both hug knowing that you both are going to feel like part of you is gone, but perhaps your sister is right. Perhaps it will ultimately be better for you in the long term. At least for her since she does have talent other than petty thievery.\n\nLater that night, your sister takes off to parts unknown and you prepare yourself for the hell that your parents are no doubt going to raise. Truth be told, if you left, they probably wouldn\u2019t cause as much fuss\u2026okay well maybe that\u2019s not entirely true, but still, your sister has always been the favorite so they\u2019re going to take this hard.\n\nThey won\u2019t be the only one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time Passes...", "result": "Six months later\u2026\n\nAs you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your girlfriend is watching you with an exasperated expression. Of course she tends to look like that a lot.\n\n\u201cUgh. This part is soooo boring! I dunno why you didn\u2019t steal the jewelry, I liked some of those necklaces.\u201d Annah exclaims.\n\u201cBecause you know I prefer hard coin in my possession rather than anything else.\u201d You reply trying not to lose count.\n\u201cSo? You\u2019re not the only one involved in doing this you know! You couldn\u2019t just think about ME for once and steal some pretty items?\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, if you wanted one of those necklaces so bad, you could have just stolen it yourself. You were closer to the merchant and easily had him distracted.\u201d\n\u201cHe was gross. Breathing heavy and touching my legs, it was all I could do not to vomit\u2026y\u2019know you could have defended my honor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be one of those days\u2026\n\n\u201c(Sigh) And how exactly was I going to do that while I was breaking into his lockbox in his tent? The whole point is for me not to attract any sort of attention and that\u2019s getting more difficult to do what with a lot of the merchants hiring more guards nowadays.\u201d\n\nAnnah rolls her eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Annah was certainly drawn to you because she\u2019s a little on the wild side and doesn\u2019t have the best of reputations herself. While she certainly lets you do things to her that are a lot of fun, she\u2019s not the partner in crime that your sister was and she certainly complains a lot more. A LOT more.\n\nAnnah\u2019s got the looks and flirting down, but that\u2019s about it. Your sister actually had the talent to get the attention of people even if they weren\u2019t some weak willed slob that went nuts over the latest sweet young thing that batted their eyes at them. She could lure them with a tale or a song and keep a whole entourage captivated if need be.\n\nYou suppose Annah\u2019s lack of skill has had the benefit of increasing your own since you\u2019ve definitely had to be quicker and sneakier.\n\nStill, it isn\u2019t just her lack of skill and bitching that\u2019s the problem since that you can deal with. It\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s way more maintenance than you thought she\u2019d be and she\u2019s been getting worse in that aspect.\n\nYou know you\u2019re probably going to have to give her a little bit more this time around just to keep her appeased. At this point you haven\u2019t really been saving much at all and you were planning on moving out of your parents home by now because that situation hasn\u2019t gotten any better since your sister left.\n\nLately you\u2019ve been starting to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just do what your sister did and leave. It\u2019s just getting to be too much hassle to steal in this town and it definitely isn\u2019t as much fun as it used to be.\n\nWhere you would go though, you aren\u2019t sure. You\u2019re going to have to figure it out.\n\nIn the meantime, you hand over Annah\u2019s share.\n\n\u201cOkay, here you go\u2026so what do you want to do now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell since you were unwilling to steal me one of those nice necklaces, I guess I\u2019ll have to buy a cheap ass one from that hag that runs Sparkling Treasures.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to Jasmine\u2019s shop.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and she\u2019s going to be giving me the evil eye the entire time. Thinking I\u2019m going to steal something.\u201d\n\u201cWell to be fair, you can\u2019t blame her. I\u2019ll come with you, but as far as I know I\u2019m still banned from the place ever since I stole a bracelet for my sister\u2019s birthday. Of course that was before we decided that the town was completely off limits.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t really want to hear about how you spoiled your other girlfriend right now. It\u2019s bad enough that continually criticize me and say I\u2019m not as good as sister.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the\u2026first of all I\u2019m sick of these rumors about me and her when it wasn\u2019t even like that! Second of all, I just said ONCE that our capers might run smoother if you had a better array of talents rather than just relying on your looks.\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again putting me down! I don\u2019t see you complaining about my talents when you\u2019re having your five minutes of fun\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow don\u2019t even start with that! Look, I don\u2019t want to fight! Let\u2019s just go get your necklace.\u201d\n\u201cI need more money!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat you gave me isn\u2019t enough for the one I want!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say Jasmine sells cheap quality shit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that old bitch charges an arm and leg for it, so I need more money!\u201d\n\nYou shake your head and reach into your pocket.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine. Here, take it! Take it all!\u201d you exclaim and hand over most of your coins to Annah, who takes them without blinking an eye.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re wondering why if she thinks you\u2019re such a bad bum to her that why is she with you at all.\n\n\u201cThanks baby!\u201d Annah beams and kisses you.\n\nWell that answers your question.\n\nAs Annah grabs your arm while you walk to Jasmine\u2019s shop, you continue to think about leaving here. The only thing is, are you going to do it like your sister did and just leave in the middle of the night, or are you going to actually say goodbye first?\n\nYou sort of think with as much grief as you give your parents, they might actually like to at least say goodbye to you seeing as they didn\u2019t get that chance with your sister.\n\nOf course that might be just wishful thinking on your part.\n\n\u201cOkay, since you said you\u2019re not allowed in, just wait outside and I\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d Annah says as you get to Sparkling Treasures.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d You remark.\n\nAnnah hasn\u2019t been gone long when you encounter more trouble.\n\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t the notorious thief of Teckville. Shouldn\u2019t you be skulking around in the shadows stealing from little old ladies?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Klint and ever since your sister left, he\u2019s been even more of an asshole to you and you\u2019re not really sure why.\n\n\u201cKlint, seriously what the hell is your problem? I don\u2019t understand this continued antagonism towards me. I don\u2019t go over to your family\u2019s chicken farm and steal the cocks out of your hand.\u201d\n\nKlint as usual is slow on the uptake and doesn\u2019t even get the double meaning insult you just said, but he\u2019s mad at you anyway.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s all your fucking fault! I could have gotten with your sister if YOU hadn\u2019t been around!\u201d\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, if my sister had ANY attraction to you, she certainly would have showed it. She didn\u2019t and now she\u2019s GONE, okay? Get the hell over it already\u2026\u201d\n\nKlint at this point starts getting closer to you and raising his voice and you begin to take a more defensive stance.\n\n\u201cFUCK YOU! It was ALL your fault! How could I have a chance with her when YOU corrupted her! Tell me\u2026did she smell like flowers when you embraced her? Did she taste like honey when you kissed her? Did the very heavens move when you plunged into her?\u201d he asks with a mixture of anger and resentment, but also with a glint of eagerness that you\u2019ll tell him.\n\nWhile you knew Klint was always a bit obsessed with your sister, you never quite knew how bad it was until just now. He\u2019s totally lost it.\n\n\u201cKlint, contrary to what the rumors are, none of that happened you sick fuck. Look, just go home before something bad happens\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh something bad is gonna happen alright sister fucker!\u201d He says and then brandishes a knife partially covered in blood and with a few feathers stuck to it.\n\nAnd of course nobody is around to see all this despite it being broad daylight. Or maybe they\u2019re just watching from windows and don\u2019t care. You\u2019re not exactly popular after all.\n\n\u201cKlint, put that knife back and just walk away now.\u201d You say stepping back.\n\u201cEveryone in this town hates you, y\u2019know. Even that whore you hang around with now. She came on to me the other night saying how she wanted a proper fuck as opposed to your pathetic attempts. I didn\u2019t fuck her though; I just let her suck my dick. Did she kiss you today? Ha ha ha ha!\u201d\n\nYou ignore Klint\u2019s ramblings and continue to focus on his knife, which is now aiming towards your face, even if you are trying to widen the gap between you two.\n\n\u201cKlint, last chance to get that knife out of my face.\u201d\n\u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s a good question, what are you going to do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Draw your own dagger", "result": "This asshole is trying to kill you! You\u2019re not taking any chances.\n\nNo sooner have you drawn your own dagger when Klint swings at you a couple times and you barely have time to dodge. Luckily for you, despite his size Klint isn\u2019t all that skilled in combat. While you\u2019ve never really been in more than a few scuffles as a kid yourself, you\u2019ve taught yourself what you THINK is adequate fighting knowledge. Also the very real threat of Klint seemingly trying to kill you is causing a survival instinct to kick in. You don\u2019t think, you just see an opportunity causing you to swing with your dagger.\n\nIt\u2019s a hit and Klint touches the side of his face and looks at the fresh blood from the medium slash you landed on his cheek. For a moment, Klint is in disbelief. He begins shaking and breathing hard. You think he\u2019s going to start crying or even run away because he realizes that this is a real fight with real consequences.\n\nKlint instead screams with rage until his face is beet red. It\u2019s sort of unnerving, but you stand your ground. Swinging his knife wildly, he charges at you still screaming the entire time.\n\nYou dodge out of the way, but your leg doesn\u2019t completely clear the charge and you fall to the ground face first.\n\nFortunately you trip up Klint in the process, who instead of taking advantage, continues to stumble in the direction he was already running in. Unfortunately, Annah was just coming out of Jasmine\u2019s shop at the time.\n\n\u201cHey what\u2019s\u2026AH!\u201d Annah yelps as Klint\u2019s knife goes straight into her stomach.\n\nYou recover just in time to see Klint hovering near her body with his knife in it. She\u2019s lying up against the door of Jasmine\u2019s shop as blood seeps out and dyes her clothing red.\n\n\u201cAnnah?\u201d you utter, but she doesn\u2019t answer she just looks down at her wound, holding it and then looks at you with a mixture of shock, pain and sadness.\n\nKlint on the other hand turns to you with a face that\u2019s now completely drained of all its rage and is a little shock himself.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d is all he stutters.\n\nANNAH!\u201d you shout and now you\u2019re the one that\u2019s going out of your mind.\n\nKlint tries to defend himself, but you\u2019re relentless. Klint falls backwards as you attack and ignoring any sort of pain he\u2019s caused with his fists or feet you begin stabbing him in the chest like a madman. Klint screams are now ones of pleading rather than anger.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it was an accident. It doesn\u2019t matter that he just said she cheated on you with him (Which might\u2019ve been a lie anyway). It doesn\u2019t even matter that she\u2019s bitching at you all the time and you were strongly considering leaving her soon anyway.\n\nThe fact is, you did have a relationship with her and to some small degree you did care.\n\nHe begs you to stop killing him, but you\u2019ve snapped. He\u2019s caused you nothing but trouble for your sister and yourself. You\u2019re ending it today and with one more strike, you thrust your dagger in his throat and then pull it out.\n\nKlint\u2019s screams become gurgles as he clutches his bloody throat. His body convulses a bit as you stand up drenched in blood. You don\u2019t stand there and watch him die however, you instead run over to Annah who is still bleeding out with a knife in her belly.\n\n\u201cShit, shit, Annah, it\u2019s gonna be okay. My dad\u2019s a doctor remember? He\u2026he\u2026he\u2019ll fix this. I\u2019m gonna go get him. Just\u2026just hang on baby\u2026\u201d you say before you\u2019re suddenly pulled away by two strong hands.\n\u201cGET AWAY FROM HER MURDERER!\u201d a gruff voice shouts from behind.\n\nStill at a heightened state of alert, you stab at whoever it is behind you, and just manage to nick their arm before twisting away.\n\nYou now see that your fight with Klint has drawn out a lot of the townsfolk. Bastards were probably watching the entire time. The man who tried to pull you away was the Wilfred the pub owner. It\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s not one of the appointed town watch, but it probably won\u2019t be long.\n\n\u201cYou little bastard! You see that? He tried to kill me too! Someone get the town watch! Someone go get Klint\u2019s family too, they need to know what this murderer did to their boy!\u201d Wilfred shouts as he clutches his bleeding arm.\n\nSeveral other townsfolk go running off shouting about your deeds, and a few others look as if they\u2019re going to take their chances apprehending you themselves and while Wilfred is a fat out of shape barkeep, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019d do as well against the blacksmith who is now approaching you with a hammer in hand.\n\nWith a lynch mob starting to form, you do the only thing you can and that\u2019s run.\n\nAfter a few moments of running and backtracking, you\u2019ve managed to make it home and lose most of the ones that were half heartedly trying to nab you, but it won\u2019t be long before what passes for real law enforcement around here is beating down your door. You only have a short time to gather what you can and get the hell out of here.\n\nOf course as soon as you come in, your mother sees you covered in blood and demands to know what is going on.\n\n\u201cBy the gods! What have you done!? What have you DONE?!\u201d your mother shouts.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! Where\u2019s dad?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m right here\u2026.oh shit. Fuck! What the hell did you do now?!\u201d your dad says walking into the room.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! But Annah is severely wounded, you gotta help her. She\u2019s got a knife in her stomach and she\u2019s over by Jasmine\u2019s shop! Please! You have to hurry!\u201d you exclaim.\n\n\u201cAre you the one who stabbed her?\u201d your father asks.\n\u201cWhat?! NO! Klint stabbed her, but everyone thinks\u2026.look\u2026 I gotta get outta here, just go help her!\u201d you say and push both of your parents out of the way to go gather a few things from your room.\n\nSurprisingly your father doesn\u2019t say much more, he just gathers up his emergency physician\u2019s bag and mutters to himself. You think you hear him saying how you\u2019re a fuck up before he leaves, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nYour mom on the other hand as you\u2019re hastily grabbing a few items, is tearfully going on about how you (And your sister) wasted your potential and she doesn\u2019t know where she and your father went wrong.\n\nYou have little time and it isn\u2019t much, but you try to reassure her that it isn\u2019t either of their faults. You\u2019d like to calm her down some more, but there are a bunch of people soon banging at the door.\n\n\u201cSTOP HIDING BEHIND YER MAMA\u2019S SKIRT AND GET OUT HERE MURDERER!\u201d you hear a voice shout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry for everything. I\u2026I gotta go.\u201d You say as you leave your mother crying and go to climb out your window.\n\nYou manage to just get out of your backyard when you hear someone else shout that they see you and you\u2019re soon off and running from a mob again.\n\nIt takes a bit of stealth and hiding on your part (along with distancing yourself from Teckleville) but eventually as the sky goes dark, you\u2019re fairly certain nobody from the town is still chasing you, or if they are, they might have made camp for the night.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019re in the middle of a wood, still wearing your bloody clothes (fortunately you managed to grab some spare in your pack though) unsure of where you\u2019re going to go exactly.\n\nOn top of it all you still don\u2019t know if Annah\u2019s dead. You\u2019re so tired. You can\u2019t even process all of it anymore. You have to rest.\n\nYou find a tree that looks sturdy and high enough, so you climb it and prepare to sleep for the night. You just hope that anyone that might still be looking for you at this late hour doesn\u2019t think to look up.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, your thoughts go to your sister.\n\n\u201cWell sis, whether things are working out for you or not right now, at least your exit wasn\u2019t like this.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day", "result": "You wake up fairly early, but then you didn\u2019t really sleep much to begin with. This was more of a brief rest anyway.\n\nAfter a quick check to see if anyone is in the area, you get out of your bloody clothes and change into some new ones. You might not be properly clean, but it\u2019s better than you were.\n\nYou then check your supplies, which aren\u2019t much. You\u2019ve got a few coins, but you aren\u2019t excessively worried about that since food and water are more important out here in the wilderness. You\u2019ve got a little food and water, but it isn\u2019t going to last long. The only weapon you have currently is your dagger.\n\nPart of you is only just now starting to feel the various negative emotions involving your parents and Annah. You can only imagine the shitstorm they\u2019re facing because of your actions. You just hope that they don\u2019t suffer the consequences of what you did.\n\nThen there\u2019s Annah. You feel like you should be feeling a lot sadder about her, maybe even crying a bit, but maybe you got all those emotions out of your system when you killed Klint.\n\nStill seems a bit surreal that you killed someone. Not just anyone, but someone you knew since childhood, even if you didn\u2019t like him.\n\nYou definitely don\u2019t feel bad about it and while that can be due to several understandable factors, you can\u2019t help but wonder if you could do it again under different circumstances.\n\nYou may have to, especially now, though your mind certainly went to a dark place during that time.\n\nWhatever the near future holds, you\u2019ll have to deal with it when it happens. Right now you have to make a decision on where you\u2019re going to go because you\u2019re not exactly hot on the idea of staying out here in the wilderness.\n\nYour first thought is to head west to the city-state of Klyton. It\u2019s certainly the closest city and it\u2019s the direction you ran from Teckleville anyway. The problem is if anyone from Teckleville is still searching for you, that\u2019s going to be the first place they look.\n\nStill, Klyton is the only place you really have any basic knowledge about thanks to your parents both being originally from there. Your father never really spoke too much about it, just saying that the only thing worthwhile that he got there was your mother and he was glad when they finally moved to Teckleville to be closer to your grandmother at the time.\n\nYour mother on the other hand didn\u2019t speak so ill of the place, which is surprising since she grew up in a lower class area than your father did. She even said that sometimes she missed the times when she worked at the inn where she met your father in the first place. Of course her knowledge about the city is bound to be a bit out of date.\n\nAlso, while Klyton has no jurisdiction over Teckleville, it has been known to apprehend wanted criminals from elsewhere trying to hide out there. Not to mention the place in general has a fairly good reputation (And they want to keep it that way) as far as its own security goes.\n\nThe Delantium Kingdom to the east isn\u2019t really high on your choice list. For one thing, you\u2019d have to backtrack around Teckleville to go in that direction. From what you\u2019ve overheard, the kingdom has been slowly trying to expand again which sounds a lot like more soldier types running around and that\u2019s the last thing you need. Still, the kingdom is a big place and they can\u2019t possibly be everywhere. Sivak is the closest major city there.\n\nThe only other nearby bastion of major civilization you can think of that\u2019s close is another city state by the name of Holgard. It\u2019s to the south and in terms of existence, it\u2019s only a little older than you are.\n\nIt was founded by a noble from the Delantium Kingdom. Originally it was most likely supposed to be some sort of outpost or colony for the DK. But whatever the original intent, the noble soon set himself up as absolute ruler with no ties to the kingdom at all.\n\nFor whatever reason, the DK hasn\u2019t taken any action against him, whether that\u2019s because the cost wouldn\u2019t be worth it, they\u2019ve got more important things to deal with or they\u2019re simply glad to have him gone is unknown. The third possibility isn\u2019t entirely out of the question either, since you\u2019ve overheard travelling merchants say that Baron Varsakken is a very unlikable man and it\u2019s amazing he hasn\u2019t suffered any assassination attempts. His children are apparently little better.\n\nStill, you\u2019ve also heard the place is filled with corruption so it would probably be a better place to do your work than Klyton.", "action_results": [{"action": "Klyton", "result": "You figure it might be best to head somewhere that you can at least get your bearings about what you\u2019re going to do in the long term with your life. Still, it would be best to stay off the road and stick to the wilderness. With a new goal, you head in the direction of Klyton and hoping nobody from Teckleville is tracking you.\n\nYou stick to the woods figuring that it will provide you with more cover. You keep alert for possible denizens that lurk in the woods themselves, but besides a lot of birds and a few normal animals, you don\u2019t encounter anything out of the ordinary. You even manage to get a good night\u2019s sleep, well as good as you can get with as paranoid as you are.\n\nUnfortunately the woods eventually begins to thin and if you continue walking the way you are going, you\u2019re going to be in the open plains and if you\u2019re going to march across the open fields, you might as well just walk on the road since you\u2019ll be just as exposed.\n\nSince you\u2019re not exactly in danger of starving or anything and the woods themselves seem fairly safe, you decide to play it cautiously by staying in the woods for the rest of the day and travel in the open at night. Hopefully it won\u2019t be a much longer trek to Klyton.\n\nYou take the opportunity to rest up some more and when the only light in the sky is that of the dim moon, that\u2019s when you leave the edge of the woods. The trees around you soon disappear and all that\u2019s left is you in the open countryside and the occasional sounds of nocturnal animals. You walk across the fields for a while, but as the grass starts getting knee high, you start hearing unfamiliar sounds. While you hope it is only a harmless nocturnal animal (or rather several of them judging by the noises) you get concerned that you might be at a disadvantage if it isn\u2019t, so you quickly make your way back towards the road where you have better vision of any potential low to the ground threats.\n\nThe road is just as empty as the plains you just left. You continue to keep aware of your surroundings by keeping an ear out for various sounds. You still have this idea that you\u2019re suddenly going to hear Teckleville watchmen on horses galloping on your position.\n\nYou continue down the road and once again you see something out of the ordinary. This time though it\u2019s a hanging cage along side the road.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of those before. Klyton apparently uses them when the jails are full and the criminal hasn\u2019t done anything bad enough to deserve outright death. So they get put in these cages until they eventually die of starvation, exposure or someone grants the mercy of killing them. Either way they aren\u2019t the city\u2019s problem anymore. Seems like it would be kinder to kill them immediately.\n\nYou walk a little further and you see a few more of them on both sides of the road. Well if there\u2019s anyone inside them, they\u2019re going to be safely locked in a cage.\n\nFirst couple cages you pass are empty. The next one has a decaying smell as you pass, but nobody is in it. You notice on the other side of the road a couple of the cages have bodies in them, but seeing as they aren\u2019t moving, you can only guess you\u2019re probably walking by corpses.\n\nAt least you think you are.\n\n\u201cHey, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have any extra water would you?\u201d you suddenly hear one of the slumping figures in the cage say.\n\nWell you may have decided to travel at night, but it would seem you\u2019re encountering more people than you thought.\n\n\u201cUh, no not really.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cThat sounded really convincing there son. Come on, if you got any you could spare some. You always got the luxury of grabbing yourself a drink at the first tavern in Klyton\u2026assuming you\u2019re even old enough...I can\u2019t quite see you, but you sound fairly young.\u201d The figure in the cage says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not young, I\u2019m a grown man!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cOh. Well apologies then. So can you please spare any water, I\u2019m dying of thirst over here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I trust you? You\u2019re in a cage meant for criminals.\u201d\n\u201cSo? What, do you think I\u2019m going to suddenly attack you or something? Even if I had the strength to grab you from between the bars and choked you out or something, that wouldn\u2019t exactly help my situation now would it? If anything it would just be harder to beg for water from the next person that passed by given that your corpse would be near my cage.\u201d\n\nStrangely that logic makes a bit of sense to you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a violent criminal anyway. I\u2019m just in here because I was a little down on my luck and stole some food. Unfortunately Klyton is pretty overzealous when it comes to their laws.\u201d The man goes on to say.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a thief?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOnly out of survival.\u201d\n\u201cExplains why you got caught. You\u2019re not a professional.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Well more apologies then, I didn\u2019t realize I was speaking to a master fucking thief. Of course if you\u2019re so good, why the hell are you wandering out here in the boonies? Shouldn\u2019t you be stealing the King of Delantium\u2019s jeweled chamber pot or something?\u201d\n\u201cHey, if you\u2019re still expecting me to give you any water you\u2019re doing a piss poor job at convincing me.\u201d You say getting a bit agitated and stepping closer to the cage.\n\nFrom this distance you get a better visual on the man in the cage. He looks about of average build, and he\u2019s a lot older than you. In fact he looks like he might be around your dad\u2019s age.\n\nOf course he gets a better look at you as well.\n\n\u201cHeh. You barely have any stubble on your face! I knew you were just a kid! Something about you though\u2026you look strangely familiar.\u201d The man remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, I\u2019ve never been to Klyton.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t look like you have. You look more like someone from a small town\u2026say you wouldn\u2019t be from Teckleville would you? That is the closest town around here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026um no why?\u201d you say and then silently cursing yourself that your lie didn\u2019t come out natural.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that slight pause as a yes and you really need to work on your attempts at misdirection and lying. What sort of thief are you?\u201d\n\u201cBetter one than you obviously, you can\u2019t even pick the easy lock on your cage.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, so Teckleville huh? Hmm\u2026.wait a minute!\u201d\n\nThe man suddenly asks if you know a doctor from Teckleville, and then goes into a description somewhat matching your dad, even mentions him by name. Does this man know your father?\n\nSince you seem to be messing up on your lies right now, you just go ahead and confirm his suspicions.\n\n\u201cThe gods are truly merciful this night! I knew your father! You look a lot like him when he was young. My name\u2019s Tom and I used to go to school with your father!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean in the university?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I used to go to primary and high school with him. I was one of his friends during childhood. I mean sure we drifted apart obviously, even more so when I dropped out altogether, but me and him were always alright with each other! I heard he moved to Teckleville years ago and had a family. Didn\u2019t know his son was a thief though\u2026how the hell did that happen?\u201d\n\u201cLong story.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I\u2019ll bet\u2026so you were saying this big ass lock on my cage looked easy?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve picked more complex merchant lockboxes.\u201d You say confidently.\n\nAt this point Tom stops slouching and begins to move towards you as much as he can in his cage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026that\u2019s good\u2026.so hey instead of water, how about you set me free?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why should I do that?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on! I was a friend of your father\u2019s! Surely he\u2019s mentioned all the fond memories of us playing smash sphere after school.\u201d\n\u201cWell, actually my father doesn\u2019t speak much about Klyton or the past at all. He prefers to forget it. Says it was mostly stressful.\u201d\n\u201cOh....well hey how about this deal then? You\u2019ve never been to Klyton, so how about in exchange for my freedom I give you some basic information on some of the neighborhoods and potential places you could easily go burgle. I mean obviously I\u2019m rubbish at it, but if you\u2019re as good as you say you are, they should be easy for you.\n\nYou might have less of a problem with releasing him if you could somehow confirm he is who he says he is. Tom certainly seems to know bits about your father that would be hard to know by some complete stranger. Your father never said anything about former childhood friends though, or if he did you weren\u2019t paying attention.", "action_results": [{"action": "Release Tom", "result": "The promise of loot is always a helpful push in any direction.\n\nEven if he\u2019s lying about being a friend of your father\u2019s, dying a slow death in a cage is still a pretty horrible way to die just for stealing food.\n\nAnd while he could also be lying about that as well you\u2019re confident in your abilities that if he tries anything, you\u2019ll be able to defend yourself if necessary. At worst he\u2019s probably going to just run off.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to take big risk here, but I\u2019m going to release you, but if you try anything I\u2019m more than capable of defending myself. I\u2019ve killed before!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhoa there son, I\u2019m not going to do anything! If anything I\u2019m going to be your best friend for life if you set me free. Look I\u2019ll even step as far back as I can in this cage and put my hands behind my back while you pick the lock!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re still a little wary, but you pull out your little lock pick set and begin to work on the big lock.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re a killer along with being a thief huh? That\u2019s quite the combination kid. I\u2019m sort of having a hard time believing it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Because I don\u2019t look like one? Because I\u2019m young?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHeh, neither of those. Known a lot of killers that don\u2019t look the part. Also known a lot of killers younger than yourself. Just having a hard time believing it because of who your father is. While your father certainly wasn\u2019t some goody two shoes as a kid, he certainly didn\u2019t go seeking out major trouble. Never did anything illegal as far as I know. I sort of figured if he ever had kids of his own, he\u2019d teach them the same.\u201d\n\nYou continue working on the lock while only really half listening to Tom\u2019s ramblings about your father.\n\n\u201cHe was always was focused on his goal of becoming a doctor. Heard even when he ran his dad\u2019s inn temporarily he did nothing but work hard all the time while still attending his classes. Yep, your dad certainly had his shit together by thinking about his long term future.\u201d\n\u201cGuess so if you like boring.\u201d You mutter.\n\u201cBoring huh? I suppose stability would be a little dull to some, still there are benefits. So is that why you\u2019re going around stealing and killing people? Running away from your boring small town and heading to the big city? Is this your form of rebellion?\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re getting irritated.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to work on this fucking lock and I\u2019m having a hard enough time doing this in near darkness without you trying analyze my home life.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d Tom remarks.\n\nAfter a bit of silence, you speak up again.\n\n\u201cAnd for the record, I don\u2019t go around killing people for fun. I\u2019ve only killed one and that\u2019s because the sonofbitch stabbed my girlfriend.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026well shit kid. That\u2019s pretty damn horrible. Guess you did what you had to then, I can respect that. Did she\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026hope not. Maybe my dad got to her in time. I had to sort of leave town in a hurry though.\u201d\n\u201cAh. I see.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the big rusty lock makes a satisfying click and you back away from the cage.\n\n\u201cThere, it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nTom wastes no time he immediately opens the door and starts pacing and stretching.\n\n\u201cDamn, you don\u2019t know how good it is to be out of that fucking thing! I should have been out of there yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what? You mean someone was already coming to get you?\u201d\n\u201cWell that was the pact I had set up with some friends of mine. If any of us ever got thrown in one of these cages, one of the others would help as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cSo how long you been in there?\u201d\n\u201cOh about a couple days.\u201d\n\u201cCouple days? You acted like you were in there for weeks!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I was really thirsty, besides I still didn\u2019t know some stranger was going to set me free. By the way, thanks a lot and nice work on that lock.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head at this situation.\n\n\u201cLet me guess, you weren\u2019t caught stealing food either.\u201d\n\u201cStealing yes, food no. It was a job and well I\u2019ll tell you on the way back to Klyton. Come on kid.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going back and you expect me to just follow?\u201d\n\u201cWell sure, didn\u2019t you at least want to know the ins and outs of the city, best places to steal from, the neighborhoods and all that? Look, I know I lied a bit, but you helped me out and with your skill set I got a feeling you\u2019d do really well in our organization.\u201d\n\u201cOrganization?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a very important member of the Crimson Talons!\u201d Tom says with some pride, you on the other hand look blank.\n\n\u201cThe Crimson Talons. By the gods kid, surely you\u2019ve heard of us. I know your dad didn\u2019t exactly hang out with outlaws, but the Talons were pretty infamous in Klyton! Used to maintain control over all criminal activity in the city!\u201d Tom remarks.\n\u201cUsed to?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI mean they still do\u2026it\u2019s just um\u2026well things are a bit different now\u2026look you\u2019re gonna wanna make good connections in this line of work and right now I\u2019m giving you a perfect opportunity to make some fucking great ones at no cost! You come with me, meet a few people and if you feel like we\u2019re not your style, well I promise you can just walk away. You really don\u2019t have anything to lose.\u201d\n\nAs much as Tom as been telling half-truths and outright bullshit, he\u2019s sort of right in that you don\u2019t really have much to lose. You\u2019re already an outlaw from your own home and everything you own is on your person and that isn\u2019t much. Not to mention you probably would have lied to gain help in the same situation.\n\nYou suppose there isn\u2019t much harm in going to see what the Crimson Talons are all about. Still, you\u2019re going to take whatever Tom is saying with a grain of salt, because on top of all the other lies he\u2019s already told, you have a hard time believing that he\u2019s really all that important in the organization.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m interested, but how are you sneaking past the city gates. I can\u2019t imagine the city guards are going to just let someone in that just escaped from a hanging cage.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s better way to get in and out of the city. We\u2019re going through a secret tunnel.\u201d Tom remarks.\n\u201cThat would certainly solve that problem. Well let\u2019s go, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019m anxious to get back. They\u2019re probably going to be surprised to see me, but believe me, I\u2019m gonna have my own questions of why they didn\u2019t come get me sooner! Now let me go over how to act and the boss\u2019 personality just so you\u2019re prepared\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd with that, you and Tom are on your way to see his Crimson Talon cohorts\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Later...", "result": "\u201cAh, here we are, just up these stairs and through that door.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cAnd here I was just getting used to walking through shitty water.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey, the sewers are the best way to get around the city.

Come on.\u201d\n\nTom and you walk up some stone stairs and Tom bangs on a sturdy looking wooden door.\n\n\u201cHey! It\u2019s me! Open up!\u201d Tom shouts, a few moments pass and a scruffy looking man rubbing his head opens the door.\n\u201cWhat the fuck you banging on the door like the city watch for? Wait\u2026Tom? What the fuck are you doing here? Weren\u2019t you taken to cages?\u201d\n\u201cYeah Vaughn, and where the hell were you guys? I thought you were supposed to come get me yesterday!\u201d\n\u201cThe heat was still pretty bad, so we decided to lay low.\u201d\n\nTom barges past Vaughn who follows and then you follow both as they continue to talk.\n\nYou must be above the sewers now though this looks like it might be an abandoned building of some sort so far. It barely looks better than the sewers you just left.\n\nYou see a few people who you assume are Crimson Talons, but they\u2019re either completely passed out or look like in various stages of being drunk or hung over. Bottles of spirits are all over the place and now you\u2019re starting to wonder just how \u201cpowerful\u201d the Crimson Talons are really supposed to be.\n\n\u201cDecided to lay low huh? Looks more like you lot stayed down here, had a party, got liquored up and forgot about me!\u201d Tom remarks.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s just not true! We didn\u2019t even spend your cut of the loot! You can even check your room! Nothing\u2019s been touched!\u201d\n\u201cI swear I\u2019m not here for a few days and this place goes to shit. Where\u2019s David?\u201d\n\u201cDavid? Um\u2026he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! He wasn\u2019t even on the job at the time. He was here!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well when the rest of us were coming back from the job, he apparently got into an argument with the boss. A really bad one about how he didn\u2019t like the way Edmond was running things. It didn\u2019t go well for either of them. Edmond might have been old, but he managed to overpower David and killed him. Unfortunately I guess it was all a bit too much exertion, because the boss died of a heart attack like almost immediately afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026you\u2019re saying the boss is ALSO dead?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah. We took both of their bodies to the usual spot if you wanted to say a few things to David\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the rats have stripped both corpses by now\u2026(sigh) so who\u2019s the new boss?\u201d\n\u201cUm, nobody. We haven\u2019t really gotten around to figuring it out yet\u2026but hey your name came up as a potential candidate! I don\u2019t think anyone else wants the job.\u201d\n\nAt this point you start laughing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I doubted you Tom. I obviously was way off about not believing that you weren\u2019t one of the most important people in this organization.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s this asshole?\u201d one of the nearby members asks stirring from his hang over.\n\u201cSomeone who actually helped me out, Jake.\u201d Tom says shaking his head at all this new information and just tells you to come with him while he checks his room.\n\nTom\u2019s room in this dump isn\u2019t quite as bad as the rest of the place. It even looks like he\u2019s taken great pains to make it look \u201cneat.\u201d After looking through his drawers and small chest, he breathes a sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cWell, as shocking as it is. All my stuff is actually still here, even my cut. Glad to see I\u2019m somewhat respected around here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they just forgot to spring you from a cage.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, I\u2019m here now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so am I. So now what? You brought me here to potentially join your little organization, but so far I\u2019m not really impressed with the organization part. I thought you guys were supposed to be infamous or something.\u201d\n\nTom sits down and exhales deeply, rubbing his face.\n\n\u201cYeah, we once were. The truth is, even by the time I got involved with his organization, it was on the decline. Still had the vicious rep at least though, maybe a bit too vicious since it probably encouraged Klyton\u2019s crackdowns and tightening up of security. Things just got worse over the years as more skilled members got arrested, killed or just quit for better pastures.\u201d Tom explains.\n\u201cPeople could just quit? I sort of though joining something like this was a for life type of thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt typically is, which is why you can see how much trouble we\u2019re in if people can just up and quit! It didn\u2019t really help when the Ebony Claw Syndicate showed up here briefly.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\u201cAnother criminal outfit. Much larger than us by far. They\u2019re based in the Delantium Kingdom, but I believe they have a strong presence in Holgard too. Edmond was an idiot when dealing with them, though I guess that was mainly pride.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n\u201cWell the Ebony Claw had heard of the Talons and their problems with Klyton\u2019s improved security. However, they also knew of our reputation even if it was a bit tattered at that point. Out of respect, they offered to help the Talons. The deal was we\u2019d still have reign over Klyton, keep our identity and have to access to Ebony Claw resources, but we\u2019d have to give a cut of all the profits we made to them. Not sure what the percentage was, but Edmond wasn\u2019t pleased with it. Though like I said, it could have been free and he probably would have turned them down.\u201d\n\u201cSo did they cause you a lot damage as well?\u201d\n\u201cIf they did, it wasn\u2019t directly. Their representative just left and we haven\u2019t heard anything from them since. Despite never seeing any signs of the Claw again, Edmond got even more paranoid than he already was. Started organizing riskier jobs and accepting anyone who was desperate enough to join. He was convinced we were going to have to deal with the Claw again so we needed to be prepared. All that ultimately happened was with all the new unskilled people we got sloppier and caused even more heat to bear down on us and well, this is what we\u2019re reduced to today.\u201d\n\nSheesh, this is pretty damn depressing. It\u2019s almost enough to make you rethink your own career choice. Almost.\n\nAt this point Tom stands up.\n\n\u201cShit, I have no idea what comes next. If I was smart I suppose I\u2019d get out. Of course if I was smart, I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation in the first place.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just start over elsewhere?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI thought about heading to Hessla, but that place is overrun by pirates nowadays. Spending days at sea isn\u2019t exactly my thing. Nah, Klyton\u2019s my home and for better or worse I\u2019m staying here.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you taking over the Talons as boss?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I never really thought of myself as a leader since it seems like a lot of headache, but I suppose out of all of us that are left, I do have the most experience and years on my side. I suppose given that my face is more well known now due to being thrown in a cage by the city watch, being the boss has appeal since I won\u2019t have to risk going out in public as much. I guarantee if I get nicked again, it\u2019ll probably be the death penalty. Well anyway what\u2019re your plans? You still interested in joining or is that a silly question?\u201d\n\nNot too silly though since despite the deplorable state the Crimson Talons are in, you sort of wonder about the potential. Before you though maybe if you joined such an organization, you\u2019d probably be considered just another low ranking flunky. However through barely any effort on your part, you may have just secured a high ranking position in the organization by helping out the new leader of it. You think if you joined and made a go of it, you\u2019d at least have a lot of input. Who knows, maybe the organization will get back on its feet. If it did, you\u2019d be even better off.\n\nOf course this is going to be a lot of work and you are still new. While Tom might like you, the other members may see you as an upstart. Getting a knife in the back from a bunch of folks who are supposed to be watching it is a real possibility. You might be better off going off on your own.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the Crimson Talons", "result": "There is an opportunity here and you\u2019re not passing it up.\n\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t exactly how I expected to start out here in this city, but I\u2019d be a fool to dismiss the potential help. I could probably learn a few things while I\u2019m here. In fact I\u2019m used to working with a partner anyway.\u201d You say.\n\u201cReally? I figured you for a loner.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cWell I sort of got forced into that situation. Before that, my twin sister and I used to steal from travelling merchants in Teckleville all the time before she left to pursue her dreams of being a bard. Worked with my girlfriend after that, but she wasn\u2019t quite as good at it\u2026you know the rest.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I can honestly say I\u2019m glad you decided to join. Your skills are going to come in useful and as you can already tell I\u2019m going to need all the help I can get. Guess since I\u2019m the boss, I\u2019ll take Edmond\u2019s old room. You can have this one. It\u2019s one of the better ones in this place so consider it part of your reward for rescuing the leader of Crimson Talons.\u201d Tom chuckles.\n\u201cIs the other part money?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you greedy little bastard. Here and I think I don\u2019t have to tell you not to brag about getting this room or the coinage. Last thing I need is people getting jealous of others, especially when they haven\u2019t been here as long.\u201d Tom says and hands you some gold coins from a small pouch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around all this. Hell, I can\u2019t even believe David\u2019s dead, let alone the boss. (Sigh) Damn idiot. Still\u2026I\u2019m gonna miss him.\u201d\n\u201cWas David your friend?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose he was. He was an asshole most of the time towards me. Always thought it was funny to sat untrue things about my mother, but I knew him since childhood too and he was often there to help if I needed it. If he had still been alive, I would have been out of that cage on time. I\u2019m guessing your father never mentioned him either.\u201d\n\u201cNot that I can recall.\u201d\n\u201cWell no matter, I guess we need to introduce you to the rest and I need to make my formal declaration that I\u2019m going to be running things.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go then.\u201d\n\nAnd so begins your life with the Crimson Talons...", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 2A: Red Storm Rising\n\n\n\nYear 17\n\n\u201cAnother good haul!\u201d Jake laughs.\n\u201cYeah, that old man didn\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cOld bastard is lucky we didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\nMeanwhile you just shake your head at the lot you\u2019ve hooked up with. While you knew this organization had some problems, you thought there was going to be an attempt at restructuring it by Tom. He seems content however on just taking a hands off approach, or at least an approach that doesn\u2019t involve a lot of rules.\n\nWhich you guess is good in some ways, but it\u2019s not exactly doing this organization any favors, especially with this lot who barely plan anything out. If it wasn\u2019t for you being so cautious, you think the militia would have apprehended most of this crew already.\n\nMost of them don\u2019t seem to realize that this city is too damn secure to just go on the way they\u2019ve been going on. A lot more subtlety and a lot less smash and grab is in order.\n\nStill, you feel like you\u2019ve already invested a bit in this organization by sticking around this long so you\u2019re not willing to bail out just yet, but something is going to have to change soon and you\u2019re going to bring it up to Tom.\n\n\u201cHey lockboy, why\u2019re you so quiet over there?\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cJust thinking about something.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cYou do a lot of that don\u2019t you?\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cHe does a whole lot of nothing. Don\u2019t know why Tom even sent you with us on this job, you were pretty useless.\u201d Jake says.\n\u201cWell, I agree my skills do go to waste when the plan isn\u2019t followed. I was supposed to pick the lock to the door and then one of you was supposed to quietly subdue the old man if he woke up and the others cleaned out the place. Instead what YOU did, was break the window on the door and unlock it that way. When that inevitably woke up the old man, you lot spent a bunch of unnecessary time taunting and beating him unconscious.\u201d You say.\n\nJake stops walking back to the Talon hideout and walks over to you.\n\n\u201cYeah? And what of it? Listen you little shit; you\u2019re just some small town snot nosed punk. You know exactly fuck all about what it means to be a Crimson Talon. If you don\u2019t like the way we do things, you can just leave. Not like you\u2019d be missed.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, hold on. We had a good night. No need for all this, let\u2019s just get back to Tom, okay?\u201d Vaughn says getting a little bit in between the pair of you.\n\nJake\u2019s been on your case since day one.

That was your best chance.\u201d He says and lunges.\n\u201cHold on! SHIT!\u201d Vaughn shouts as he gets out of the way of Jake and yourself.\n\nJake tackles you to the ground and you try to throw another punch, but this time Jake catches your fist. His grip is very strong. A lot stronger than you thought he\u2019d be actually.\n\n\u201cNot this time.\u201d He says and then smashes his fist into your nose, breaking it and causing blood to flow from your nostrils. You have a hard time catching your breath, but that\u2019s a secondary feeling when Jake proceeds to break your wrist and then punch you in the face again.\n\n\u201cJake! Stop! You made your point!\u201d Zalmora shouts.\n\u201cCome on Jake, get off\u2026\u201d Vaughn says attempting to move Jake off of you.\n\nYou feebly throw a punch with your one good hand, but again you don\u2019t connect very well and only manage to his Jake\u2019s side. Meanwhile Jake punches your two more times in the face nearly knocking you out completely and certainly knocking out several teeth.\n\nEventually Vaughn and Zalmora pull Jake off of you who is laughing.\n\n\u201cKnew you weren\u2019t shit. Good luck picking a lock with one good hand for awhile!\u201d Jake says and begins walking away.\n\nZalmora comes back to you and helps you up. It\u2019s actually amazing that you\u2019re able to stand though you\u2019re having a hard time with the balance.

You know where you\u2019re at?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\nYou hear her just fine, you\u2019re just trying to gather what strength you have and keep your focus on that laughing asshole Jake who is continuing to walk away from you.\n\nYou draw your weapon.\n\n\u201cNo! Wait!\u201d Zal says before you push her aside and sprint towards Jake fully intent on revenge. Unfortunately Vaughn and Zal shout at you to stop, which gives Jake enough warning to turn around.\n\nJake falls to the ground and trips you with his legs. You fall face first and drop your weapon.\n\nYou don\u2019t get another chance to get up before Jake takes advantage of your position by jumping on your back and wraping his arms around your neck.\n\n\u201cStupid fucker, you brought all this on yourself.

Aren\u2019t you going to celebrate our successful job?\u201d\n\u201cYou guys seem to have a handle on that, besides don\u2019t really feel like celebrating with Jake.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWell how about just a private celebration between us then?\u201d Zalmora says and moves in closer to you.\n\nYou weren\u2019t aware Zalmora had any kind of attraction to you before, but it\u2019s definitely apparent now.\n\n\u201cWhat? Seriously? Weren\u2019t aware you were interested in me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHah, don\u2019t flatter yourself. I just want a quick tumble and I don\u2019t feel like finding myself some rent boy or dealing with Jake\u2019s usual asshole behavior right now. Plus, you\u2019re young and a lot less repulsive\u2026hey are you a virgin?\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but no.\u201d\n\u201cPity, might have been fun to deflower you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m not interested\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You seriously can\u2019t be saying there\u2019s something wrong with the way I look! Oh shit, you\u2019re not like Vaughn are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026wait, how is Vaughn like?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s into guys. Thought that was obvious.\u201d\n\u201cNever noticed, but no, I just got something important business to talk to Tom about.\u201d\n\u201cLike what? More ideas about how to improve things around here? I know how you\u2019re not satisfied with how things are around here, but then I suppose you aren\u2019t the only one.\u201d\n\u201cWell if everyone here isn\u2019t satisfied with how things are, why aren\u2019t changes being made? I mean Tom even said he was going to start reorganizing the Crimson Talons.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Tom\u2019s no leader. He\u2019s just leader because nobody else wants the hassle. Well except maybe Jake, but nobody really wants to follow him either.\u201d\n\u201cSo why stick around?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? What else are we going to do, get real jobs? Besides, things are actually going a little bit better than they were with Edmond. Tom\u2019s not likely to start executing folks over small mistakes at least. Plus in this line of work it\u2019s a lot better to have a few people watching your back. Now how about we stop all this talking and go to your room where you can watch my back up close?\u201d\n\nZalmora now puts her hand directly on your cock, which is definitely interested even if you claimed that you weren\u2019t.\n\nWell, you can think with one head or the other, but you can\u2019t do both.\n\nAnd like most guys your age (Or guys in general) you make your most important decision with your dick.\n\nYou figure you can always talk to Tom later, but Zalmora might not be in the mood later if you turn her down now. She\u2019s actually attractive in a trashy sort of way (Sort of reminds you of Annah in that way), it\u2019s just she seemed sort of inaccessible since she was several years older and never paid much attention to you before.\n\nYou and Zalmora go back to your room and get into it pretty quickly. You also learn a few things, which is a fun process even if she\u2019s a bit bossy about it. Eventually you\u2019re entirely spent and satisfied.\n\n\u201cThat it? Figured we\u2019d go around a third time.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cMaybe in a few minutes. Um, you uh\u2026good?\u201d You ask.\n\u201cMore or less. You guys always fall a bit short, but at least I wasn\u2019t dealing with Jake\u2019s whiskey dick this time around. Thanks for asking though at least.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t reply to that and instead just keep quiet, not wishing to dwell on any potential bedroom failings on your part, let alone Jake\u2019s dick.\n\nZal soon breaks up the silence though.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. ideas, what exactly were you going to bring up to Tom as far as changes and such?\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Crimson Talon and if you\u2019re going to be whispering ideas into Tom\u2019s head and I\u2019m going to be affected by those changes, in the unlikely event he even listens of course. Besides, I might have a few ideas of my own.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have ideas, why not bring them to Tom\u2019s attention?\u201d\n\u201cI have. I don\u2019t think he likes me though. In fact I think he\u2019s got a deep-seated dislike of women in general. I\u2019m sure it has something to do with his mother being a lesbian or something.\u201d\n\u201cWait, Tom\u2019s mother was a lesbian?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You didn\u2019t know that? His buddy David used to tell stories about her and make jokes all the time back when he was still alive. She used to work as a miner and had a girlfriend who Tom always insisted was just her roommate even though they slept in the same bed. Still in denial about it, though he might actually be that clueless. Y\u2019know, I don\u2019t think he ever knew who his father was. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m sort of wondering how Tom was even conceived in the first place considering from what I heard his mother was firmly into pussy.\u201d\n\nWell there\u2019s another bit of information you can add to your mental notes.\n\n\u201cBut getting back to my point Tom doesn\u2019t really want to be bothered to change things too much because as I said, he lacks the ambition to be a true leader. Still, he seems to like you since you rescued him from that cage and you generally don\u2019t give him grief, so maybe there\u2019s a chance. Come on, I let you into this temple I call a body, you can at least let me into that head of yours a bit.\u201d\n\u201cYou got a way with words Zal. Well okay, I suppose this stuff isn\u2019t really top secret or anything.\u201d\n\nYou begin to tell Zalmora about your concerns with how things are done regarding robberies. There is little finesse, nobody sticks to a plan and it\u2019s more outright thuggery. You go on to mention that it might not be as much of a problem if you weren\u2019t in a city fanatical about curbing crime, but since you are, this is kind of a big problem in the long term.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026I hear you there. I admit we\u2019ve all sort of gotten lazy about that over the years. I remember when I first joined I was one of the best cat burglars here. As things slowly deteriorated, guess I just said fuck it. So what else you think needs changing around here?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cWell for a criminal organization we aren\u2019t exactly diverse. Granted I don\u2019t know much about running something like this, but I have heard the old Crimson Talon glory day stories. The Talons used to have fighting pits, used to sell Green Lotus and Yellow Devil, we had whores, I mean a whole bunch of shit that brought in a steady revenue of coinage.\u201d\n\nZalmora nods her head.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right about that as well. I wasn\u2019t a member when they still had the fighting pits, but I do remember seeing a few when my dad bet on them. Even as a little girl I knew I liked seeing two big guys get all sweaty and bloody, beating the shit out of each other. I know there are the Klyton gladiators, but they wear so much damn armor that they barely get hurt and it\u2019s very rare to see a fatality. Pretty sure it\u2019s all fixed anyway. The Klyton Council probably makes a shitload of money off that racket. Too bad we aren\u2019t politicians.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cWell what about the other stuff?\u201d\n\u201cThe drugs? Well Green Lotus or a milder form of it is legal here now, so that\u2019s out. Yellow Devil as far as I know was never a big money maker due to it having a major chance of causing the user\u2019s innards to melt and bleed from every orifice. Of course Blue Dream is the big one nowadays, but the Ebony Claw Syndicate mostly has a monopoly on its production and distribution. None of us knows how to make it or has connections. But then drugs have never been an interest of mine. The Talons actually did control a few whorehouses at one time, until government shut them all down and then built some nicer, fancier and Klyton run ones. Being a whore has never been more respectable. Okay, maybe not. But the point is, the Klyton Council effectively destroyed the Talons by legalizing shit and taking it over more than they ever did with just the militia.\u201d\n\nBefore you can go into some of your other ideas, Zalmora stops you with some of her own.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m impressed that you\u2019re thinking a lot more about this shit than most people here, I\u2019m of the mind that for now, we should play more on our current strengths. We can diversify again later.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cOur current strengths are basically smashing people in their face and taking their shit. I thought we established that isn\u2019t exactly good in the long term.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t in Klyton, but we could always start doing it outside of Klyton. Robbing caravans and such on the roads. It isn\u2019t like Jake is going to care where he does it and those two half elf whores will probably be ecstatic about working outside the city. Also, the militia isn\u2019t going to be as fanatical about tracking down shit that goes on outside the city.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well that style would favor road robberies a lot more. It\u2019s still not really what I\u2019m about though.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you could always gather the intelligence for us. Find out what caravans and wagons are leaving, which way they\u2019re going, how well protected, all that stuff. Plus maybe you can start actively look for recruits.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? You spend most of your time walking around the city anyway when you\u2019re pilfering pocket in your free time. Not saying that you have to be the one to speak with them, but you could bring it to Tom\u2019s attention and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be receptive. I\u2019m sure when we build up our numbers AND wealth we can start branching out a bit more again. Like property and fronts.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026is this all what I should propose to Tom?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe plans to move our activities to mainly outside Klyton, yes. The rest of it, I\u2019d keep a lid on until later. It will be better to not overwhelm him with suggestions. So, you ready for another round stud, or do we have to waste more time talking?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh yeah, sure!\u201d you say and immediately move on to more important matters.\n\nAfter spending more fun time with Zalmora, you do eventually get around to speaking with Tom and just like Zal predicted, he\u2019s actually receptive to your ideas. He says that it probably would be better to start reigning in the loot and pillage tactics in the city.\n\n\u201cReally should have thought about doing it before. I was just so concerned about keeping everyone together and happy, I neglected to remember that I\u2019m supposed to be improving our position as leader, not just being content on survival. Anyway, I\u2019m sure this will be something everyone can get on board with, well the majority of them anyway. And yes, since you came up with all this, you can still keep your activities to Klyton while you seek out potential new members. I know you won\u2019t make a damn mess of things and generally keep your head down.\u201d Tom remarks.\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019m really going to do my best to make this work.\u201d\n\u201cI know you will kid, you\u2019ve always been a good earner. Looks like Yag really blessed me when you I met you in that cage that night. Good thing the rest of that lot out there were late after all.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOkay, well let me go address this new change to everyone.\u201d\n\nTom announces the changes and like with any change, everyone has an opinion. Mostly for the better thankfully. Jake complains the loudest, but when it\u2019s pointed out that it doesn\u2019t matter if he kills people as much, he grumbles slightly less.\n\nZalmora is certainly pleased about all this and says she knew you\u2019 d be able to convince Tom better than anyone else.\n\nOnly time will tell if any of these changes mean shit though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 21\n\n\u201cThe Bloody Smiles are lead by a vicious bandit calling himself the Grinning Man. Nobody has gotten a really good look at him as most don\u2019t survive his attacks, but based on this crude sketch, I implore anyone seeing him to run and contact Klyton militia immediately! This man and his band of cutthroats have been plaguing the roads and the surrounding area for years and hopefully now that his identity is known\u2026\u201d\n\nYou suddenly receive one of the many sketches a concerned citizen is handing out. You take one look at the sketch as you walk away from the crowd and shake your head.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t even look like that asshole.\u201d You say and toss it in a nearby bin.\n\nJake\u2019s job has really been doing the trick as far as distracting the Klyton militia, though maybe it\u2019s been going a little too well. You suggested that Tom to pull him back from this two years ago, but predictably he never did.\n\nZalmora and Vaughn returned pretty quickly after this plan went into action, though in Zal\u2019s case it seemed to be more because she wanted to get back into regular burglary again. Vaughn said he couldn\u2019t deal with Jake anymore and was getting too crazy.\n\nNow, he\u2019s given himself a nickname, gone on to call his group the Bloody Smiles and doesn\u2019t report back to Tom for months. When he does, he just sends one of the newer Talons with some goods and loot. While Tom as usual is taking a laid back approach to this figuring as long as he\u2019s still sending shit back then everything is good, you question whether Jake is even thinking about the Talons anymore.\n\nMeanwhile, you\u2019ve been more or less successful in building up the Talon\u2019s numbers. Not as much as you\u2019d like, but since you\u2019re the only one doing it, it is what it is. Despite all this extra help however, it\u2019s not being utilized properly. Most of it is being sent to help Jake as his numbers get whittled down every now and then and that\u2019s really a waste you believe.\n\nThe ones you insist on keeping around to train are fewer in number and you\u2019re also the only one bothering to train them properly. You never thought you\u2019d be in that sort of position. Occasionally Zal and Vaughn help out, but it\u2019s mostly fallen on you.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a case where the opportunity to expand is there, but once again Tom is failing to pull the trigger on it. You should be setting up another underground fighting pit, setting up gambling dens or even running a protection racket. Something needs to be done about Jake because the Crimson Talons can\u2019t proceed if half of the members aren\u2019t even Talons anymore and have declared allegiance to another leader.\n\n\u201cSomething has to be done about Jake.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cI dunno, but Tom can\u2019t just sit on his ass anymore about it. Jake hasn\u2019t done it yet, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before he splits off from the Crimson Talons altogether and takes half of our members that were assigned out there with him. Ideally we could just tell him to come home and his purpose out there is no longer necessary, but I doubt if he\u2019ll listen.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what? You just going to go in there and tell Tom what he needs to do?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cSomeone needs to tell him something! As I remember it was me who told him to start changing shit up last time too.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but doesn\u2019t that sort of mean you\u2019re sort of responsible of what\u2019s going on with Jake? Pretty sure that\u2019s what Tom will point out as well.\u201d Vaughn says.\n\nYou\u2019re about to tell Vaughn to shut the hell up when Zalmora interrupts.\n\n\u201cWhile you have some good ideas as usual, honestly, I\u2019m not sure why anything needs to be done about him. I say if Jake has split from the Crimson Talons, well that\u2019s more for us.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cActually that\u2019s LESS for us since he won\u2019t even be sending his cut anymore.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe in the short term, but you\u2019re not thinking long term. The militia hasn\u2019t been as much of a problem in the city for us because they\u2019ve been focused mainly on catching Jake and the rest. That gives us a little more freedom to expand like you said. Hell, now that Jake has foolishly started to give his group their own name, they aren\u2019t even directly connected to the Talons anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSo? If he gets caught he could still blab his mouth about our secret hideout.\u201d\n\u201cJake\u2019s a lot of things, but he ain\u2019t no rat. Chances are they won\u2019t even take him in alive anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so maybe Jake\u2019s no rat, but what about some of others with him? I mean sure, we\u2019ve all stressed how important loyalty is to the new recruits, but if Jake\u2019s gained their trust somehow, then they\u2019re loyal to him not to the Talons and they aren\u2019t going to think twice about ratting us out to save their own skin.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, you might have a point there.\u201d Vaughn says.\n\u201cLook, all I\u2019m saying is Jake not causing shit for us in the city and running around out there like a mad man is better for us. If he\u2019s gone, then the militia is just going to refocus more of their attention on the city again. I mean maybe it might be best to make it an official break up. Let Jake know he can go his way and we go ours. Might diffuse any potential problems with Jake. Dunno if Tom will be into that though.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true too.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\nYou rub your hands through your hair.\n\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe. Something still needs to be brought up to Tom though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh I agree with you on that. It is time to give him a little push again.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t either of you coming in with me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm\u2026I hadn\u2019t planned to. I mean it sounds like you\u2019ve got this under control on what to discuss. I think me being there is just going to look like we\u2019re ganging up on him.\u201d Vaughn says.\n\u201cYeah. And as you know, Tom has never been fond of me. So I would be more of a detriment. Just go in and talk to him, you did fine last time remember?\u201d Zalmora says nudging into you a bit.\n\u201c(Sigh) Why do I feel like I\u2019m the only one who cares about this organization?\u201d\n\u201cHey! That\u2019s not even true! I just gave you my fucking thoughts on the situation didn\u2019t I? You bring up whatever you want to Tom. I\u2019m sure everything will work out fine, he likes you after all.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Zal and Vaughn leave to let you go speak with Tom. You swear you never thought the day would come where you would be known as the \u201cdiplomat.\u201d You guess your sister\u2019s charm rubbed off on you just a little bit. You sometimes wonder how she\u2019s doing. Probably better than you are at any rate.\n\nMentally preparing yourself, you head to Tom\u2019s office, though when you think more about it, you don\u2019t know why you\u2019re mentally preparing yourself. It isn\u2019t like Tom\u2019s going to even threaten to kill you if he doesn\u2019t agree with what you have to say.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re practically his second in command anyway and you\u2019re still baffled by this since you haven\u2019t been here nearly as long, though you suppose with all these new folks coming in, you are starting to become a \u201cvet\u201d as it were.\n\n\u201cHey Tom.\u201d You say entering his office.\n\u201cHey kid, any new blood you need me to check out and make a final decision on?\u201d\n\u201cUh, no not today. I wanted to speak with you about another matter\u2026it\u2019s about Jake.\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s head drops down briefly with a deep sigh and then he looks up.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026I figured it might be getting close to dealing with that situation. Trust me, I HAVE been giving some thought to it, even though I\u2019d rather not.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m afraid something is going to have to be done about him. You can\u2019t just have a divided organization with half of it\u2019s members calling themselves something else and primarily pledging allegiance to another leader.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t that bad! I mean he\u2019s still providing a share of the loot to us right?\u201d Tom says hopefully.\n\u201cPerhaps, but think how much longer the intervals are starting to get, not to mention how much is he actually holding back? How long before he just stops sending altogether? No, we have to do something.\u201d\n\u201cAre you suggesting an attack? Because while I know around where he\u2019s currently located, I\u2019m not entirely sure of the exact area. He may have even moved since he has to do that a lot anyway. Fairly certain not only would he have the advantage, but even if we win, we\u2019re going to suffer heavy losses which sort of defeats the purpose.\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking more of a stealthy assassination.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to do that?\u201d\n\u201cI could try. Maybe I could take a few others with me to help.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense kid, but even if he didn\u2019t have half our numbers with him and you had help I don\u2019t think you could take Jake. Jake is the best fighter we have and he\u2019s probably only gotten better since being out there. I\u2019m not risking anyone in a foolish assassination attempt, let alone an internal conflict. Although\u2026no\u2026that\u2019s not an option\u2026\u201d Tom says trailing off.\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026if we DID go this route, and I\u2019m not saying we are. I know a few outside folks that might be able to do it without problems. Damn, I just wish there was a less messy way of handling this.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Well I hate to bring this up, but I have thought of a diplomatic solution which might be possible.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\nYou explain to Tom about a potential split with Jake altogether and just letting him go his own way since he seems happier anyway. Tom isn\u2019t too fond of the idea since it no longer means gaining a cut of Jake\u2019s looting profits, but he\u2019s not outright dismissing it. In fact out of all the options, Tom still seems to think the best plan is to do nothing.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019re bothering.", "action_results": [{"action": "Assassination", "result": "Something has to be done and the best way to do it is to kill Jake. Not like you were ever friends with him.\n\n\u201cLook, we can\u2019t do nothing and if you aren\u2019t fond of diplomacy, then we need to kill Jake. So who are these independent assassins you know?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cReally only know two and out of those two, only one is a proper assassin and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible with him.\u201d Tom says.\n\nFrustration increases\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, so tell me about the guy who isn\u2019t a proper assassin.\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe goes by the name Olaf. He\u2019s actually an ex-Talon associate but after the fight pits closed down he went back to working as a leg breaker for Mr. Reynolds full time. You familiar with that man?\u201d Tom asks.\n\u201cVaguely. Some sort of moneylender with connections in high places so the militia doesn\u2019t fuck with him. Actually, I think I remember my mother telling me my father\u2019s family was in debt to him at one point.\u201d\n\u201cThey did with the inn. Actually I even worked for the man briefly before I joined the Talons, but that\u2019s ancient history. Olaf is a big ass ogre who pretty much retired undefeated during his fighting pit days. He\u2019s older of course now, but I don\u2019t doubt that he couldn\u2019t take care of Jake and scare everyone else into submission. Hell, he probably could scare Jake into submission too. He\u2019d probably even do it for free or at the least very cheap. He really likes hurting people.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good, so what\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\u201cWell obviously Mr. Reynolds isn\u2019t going to just let him go wandering off so we\u2019d probably have to pay him and that\u2019s what isn\u2019t going to be cheap. Plus, knowing Mr. Reynolds he\u2019ll have some other weird stipulation. You\u2019ll probably find out when you talk with him. Could be anything.\u201d\n\nThis is sounding complicated already. You almost hesitate to ask about the other one.\n\n\u201cOkay, so what about this other guy. The real assassin?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou familiar with Sotakians?\u201d Tom asks.\n\u201cJust stories of them being lizard people that live in the swamps and fight with elves all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the old boss, Edmond actually acquired an egg and raised a Sotakian from a hatchling. Trained him to be a very literal cold-blooded assassin bodyguard. We all just called him Scales, but he never really had a proper name. He was very loyal too until he had some unknown disagreement with Edmond and just took off. Ed never told anyone to go get him either. Just said to let it go.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very useful if he disappeared to parts unknown.\u201d\n\u201cOh he didn\u2019t go far. He actually lives in the Klyton sewers. Abandoned part granted, but he\u2019s actually part of the reason why the militia doesn\u2019t patrol down there that much and only in certain areas. Ol\u2019 Scales isn\u2019t very welcoming to intruders to his home.\u201d\n\u201cWell how\u2019s this lizard going to be of any help then?\u201d\n\u201cMost of the time when Scales got a little obstinate Edmond showed him the broken egg that he hatched from. Not sure why it worked. Maybe it was a reminder that Edmond was the one who helped hatch him or something. Still have the broken egg just in case, you know? Maybe if someone approached him with the broken egg, Scales might be willing to listen to that person. Dunno, who would have the balls to go risk it though.\u201d\n\u201cThat vicious huh?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, Olaf USED to have an equally bad ass barbarian buddy by the name of Silence. Silence didn\u2019t like it when he lost a staring contest to Scales and things got violent. Olaf and Silence were best friends and Olaf didn\u2019t even ATTEMPT to attack Scales when he ripped out Silence\u2019s throat in five seconds. He just left the room and I can\u2019t be certain, but I think he might have even cried. Of course nobody was going to ask. Olaf certainly brutalized folks more than average in the fighting pits over the next few days after that though.\u201d\n\nSo those are your choices and they both sound shitty. Honestly, you wish you could just take care of Jake yourself, but Tom is probably right about the fact that something like that isn\u2019t really your specialty, but talking to others and trying to convince them to do what you want is apparently a newer one you\u2019ve acquired or at least one you\u2019ve been thrust into.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hire Olaf", "result": "If Scales is killing people just for trespassing, you don\u2019t fancy your chances. At least with this ogre you\u2019re not going to get killed just for showing up. (You hope)\n\nAlong with giving you the location of where Jake is supposed to be currently camped out, Tom gives you the directions to Mr. Reynolds place, though you\u2019ve passed it a few times before during your stretch here in Klyton so you know where it is. From what you\u2019ve heard, Mr. Reynolds hasn\u2019t changed his location in decades and he wasn\u2019t young when your grandfather (And later father) owed him money. While you\u2019ve also heard he looks human, there are rumors that he isn\u2019t or he\u2019s at least cheating the aging process somehow.\n\nYou aren\u2019t really interested in all that though; you just hope you won\u2019t have to pay some outrageous price for Olaf\u2019s services.\n\nYou bid Tom goodbye and head on out to Mr. Reynolds' place which is a simple walk to one of the more rundown areas of Klyton.\n\nWhen you enter his simple place of business, you see a well dressed man with a goatee standing just inside the entrance flipping a knife into the air and catching it by the handle every time. He begins staring at you, but never stops flipping and catching his knife.\n\nYou look to your right and see a large humanoid in an oversized chair, arms folded and snoring heavily. You wonder if this must be Olaf. He\u2019s certainly big and ugly enough to be an ogre, though in this state he almost looks peaceful rather than the menacing brute you heard about.\n\n\u201cAh, a customer! Well don\u2019t just stand there looking at my employees, come forward and let me see what I can do for you.\u201d A voice calls out from across the room.\n\nYou see who could only be Mr. Reynolds. He\u2019s even better dressed than the employee flipping the knife. As you approach he doesn\u2019t look any older than his mid forties. Who know though and that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\n\nHe smiles when you get to his desk.\n\n\u201cSomehow. Somehow I KNEW you were going to come in here one day. You look like your father around the same time we did business. How is he anyway?\u201d he asks.\n\nYou don\u2019t even ask how he knows who you are.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s uh\u2026good I guess. Doctor now.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cGood for him. Glad to hear things ultimately worked out after our business was concluded. And they say loans are a bad thing. So what can I do for you today? I assume it can\u2019t be for money as I know you\u2019re quite the skilled thief around town. I must say the Crimson Talons must be doing better nowadays. Pity you have that fool Tom in charge, but then these things are never permanent are they?\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cI guess not. Look I was told that you might be willing to let Olaf do some work for the Talons.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, must be pretty serious if you\u2019re looking for an ogre to take care of this work and not doing it yourself. What\u2019s this all about exactly?\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t really expect him to pry, but you feel like he\u2019s probably not even going to entertain the idea unless you tell him everything about the plan. So you tell him and he listens intently. Meanwhile Olaf is still snoozing and the other man is continuing to watch you.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly an interesting plan you got there and I can only assume the initial set up of it was equally as interesting. I just don\u2019t think I can loan you Olaf though. Sorry.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cWhat? We can pay your price. I mean as you said we\u2019re doing a lot better now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd I believe you, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable putting one of my employees at risk like that. He could very well die.\u201d\n\u201cI was told Olaf was a champion pit fighter and this would be easy for him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he was a champion. Decades ago. Look at him, that beautiful white mane and beard he has isn\u2019t just for show, it denotes age! He\u2019s old and not the young killing machine he used to be. Oh sure he\u2019s good for intimidating a few deadbeats and even knocking them around a bit, but if I let him go do what you want him to do, he\u2019s going to die even if he somehow manages to succeed. And while Olaf wouldn\u2019t mind such a proud warrior\u2019s death, I happen to be good friends with his wife and she\u2019d be very upset and I can\u2019t have that on my conscience.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know female ogres were so sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s married to a Halfling, but my point is, Olaf isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nWell you certainly weren\u2019t expecting this.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) So there\u2019s no way you can help me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAh, now I didn\u2019t say that. While I can\u2019t loan you Olaf, I can allow you the services of my other employee Henry over there. Henry! Stop playing with your knife and get over here. Got work for you.\u201d\n\nHenry slowly walks over to the desk still never taking his eyes off you the whole time. He then takes his knife and stabs it into the desk as hard as he can. This action causes you to step back a bit and you prepare to draw your own weapon until Mr. Reynolds calms everyone down.\n\n\u201cRelax. Relax, nobody is stabbing anyone here. My son is a little excitable at times.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cYour son? This man is your son?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cSure. Can\u2019t you see the resemblance? Meh, I guess he does look a lot more like his mother Wendy. Anyway, not important. What is important is that Henry here has what they call a natural talent. He\u2019s been honing it since he was a child, I was so proud when he finally sought me out to join the family business. Now, he might not be as big and strong as ol\u2019 Olaf over there, but I guarantee he\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTrust me. You came here because I could help you solve your problem. Maybe not the way you thought, but the job WILL get done. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cWell since I know your name and reputation mean a lot to you, I\u2019m going to go ahead and believe you, so how much is all this going to cost?\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred gold coins, but since I can tell you\u2019re a bit apprehensive about all this, you can pay me after the job is done. If the results aren\u2019t to satisfaction, well I\u2019m sure Tom can pay what he feels is an appropriate amount. Now, why don\u2019t you tell Henry about the job and what you want done exactly?\u201d\n\nYou give Henry the instructions and he listens without saying a word still giving you that icy stare the entire time. While a little unnerving, you can\u2019t actually say you\u2019re getting pants shitting intimidated. Henry could very well be the badass killer his dad claims, but right now he seems like he\u2019s trying too damn hard.\n\nMr. Reynolds tells you that the job will be done by the end of the week, and you and Tom can return to his office at that time. You leave the office a little concerned about all this, but it\u2019s done now.\n\nWhen you get back you inform Tom, who doesn\u2019t seem at all concerned, just a little surprised that it isn\u2019t Olaf, but he has confidence in Mr. Reynold\u2019s choice of assassin and is sure it will be worth it.\n\nVaughn and Zalmora are the only other people that know about this plan and while Vaughn is a go with the flow type guy as well, Zalmora still thinks getting rid of Jake in this manner was a bad idea.\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that she\u2019s right.\n\nInstead of being discreet or even just killing Jake and scaring the others into returning to the fold, Henry turned the Bloody Smiles camp into a graveyard. He got the job done, but killing every fucking body wasn\u2019t what was wanted.\n\nYou complain quite loudly, which doesn\u2019t frazzle Mr. Reynolds in the least. Tom attempts to calm you down. When that fails, he tells you to go wait outside and he\u2019ll speak to Reynolds in private. Henry glares at you as you leave. As much as you\u2019d like to punch the guy, you know that wouldn\u2019t be a smart move considering what he just did.\n\nYou wait outside for a long time and eventually Tom exits the building. He says to you that you\u2019ll speak when you get back to headquarters. You walk back in silence.\n\nAs soon as you enter though he starts scolding you for losing your temper in front of Mr. Reynolds and disrespecting him as head of the organization. You defend why you\u2019re getting mad about the situation and don\u2019t understand why he isn\u2019t since it\u2019s fucked up the plans that were supposed to be set in motion. When you find out he paid the five hundred coins anyway you get even angrier.\n\nVarious Crimson Talon members stop what they\u2019re doing to watch this spectacle.\n\n\u201cYou still PAID him?! You paid him for doing a half assed job?! What the fuck?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit kid. Staying on Reynolds\u2019 good side is\u2026\u201d Tom starts to say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cNo, stop fucking talking! You\u2019re a terrible fucking leader and EVERYONE here knows it!\u201d\n\u201cIs that right? I don\u2019t see anyone else stepping up to do this fucking job!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well maybe that needs to change.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? You gonna be the one to do that? Pfft. Fuck you kid. You tried to pull that I\u2019m a killer shit when you first met me in that hanging cage. Didn\u2019t buy it then and I\u2019m certainly not buying it now.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, the cage that I rescued your ass from, because nobody here gave a shit! And your leadership is a good example of why nobody does, because you\u2019re ultimately a weak leader who is content on coasting and leeching off others.\u201d\n\nTom doesn\u2019t say any more he just throws a punch at you. You dodge and follow up with a punch of your own.\n\nThe fight isn\u2019t stopped, because it\u2019s obvious people either want to see a change in leadership or Tom prove that he\u2019s still got what it takes to lead the Talons.\n\nDespite the ongoing past criticism of Tom of how he\u2019s a weak leader, he\u2019s not really a weak man because he dominates the fight for the most part. He\u2019s certainly a better fighter than you.\n\nHis problem is he still doesn\u2019t want it as bad as you.\n\nThough Tom was pissed at you and knew he had to kick your ass, he never had any intention on killing you. All of his blows against you were normal kicks and punches. Never once does he say, pull out a dagger and stab you in the face with it.\n\nBecause that\u2019s exactly what you do to him.\n\nHe screams, wails and flails around the room for a moment before you tackle him back down to the floor.\n\nAs he begs for you to stop killing him all you can think of is Klint doing the same thing and you drive your short sword through his chest telling him to shut the fuck up and die the entire time.\n\nWhen Tom finally stops breathing, you get up and declare yourself the new leader of the Crimson Talons.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re gonna start doing things differently around here.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\n\u201cWell, what the hell do these folks expect?

So keeping business in the sewers is about the safest place to do all this if we want to avoid sudden raids.\u201d\n\u201cIt might not have been necessary to wallow in the sewers if they had another distraction.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said many times in the past, but I think things still worked out with me in charge.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing okay I suppose, but I\u2019m still not sure if bum fight gambling and going back to selling Yellow Devil was the way to go about it.\u201d\n\u201cHey we\u2019ve got whores too.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, those mostly tie into the Yellow Devil trade. I shudder to think about the hopeless cases that actually pay to fuck YD junkies.\u201d\n\u201cHey not everyone can afford the high priced Klyton brothels. Look, I saw that the only way we were going to survive is to have steady businesses. The Klyton Council are the biggest criminal overlords and nobody says shit because they effectively legalized everything and control the biggest gang to protect their interests. I mean there wasn\u2019t really any way to feasibly compete except offer similar things at lower the prices and cater to the lower class.\u201d\n\nZalmora looks at nearby group betting and getting excited over a giant roach race.\n\n\u201cPretty sure some of these folks are under the lower class.\u201d Zalmora replies.\n\u201cYeah, well a coin\u2019s a coin, don\u2019t you have a house to break into or something?\u201d you say.\n\u201cAlways, but I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t come on these things like you used to.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I gotta look after shit around here. I just can\u2019t drop everything to go rip off a store. I\u2019m not Tom, I don\u2019t just sit on my ass doing nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were, but you used to be a little more fun at least. Like those first few years when you got here. Remember?\u201d Zalmora says with a bit of a smile.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not a damn stupid teenager anymore that gets distracted by a pretty girl that wiggles her ass at me.\u201d\n\nZalmora steps back from you a bit giving a slightly perturbed look.\n\n\u201cOkay Mr. bossman, if you hadn\u2019t initially taken my advice in the first place you wouldn\u2019t even be in this position.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cOR if I hadn\u2019t taken your advice, I might have been in this position a lot sooner. In fact despite you always bringing it up, I\u2019d say not listening to you turned out to be a lot better \u201d you remark.\n\u201cRight, because this is such a great position to be in.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge ain\u2019t I? Y\u2019know what your problem is? You thought you were going to manipulate me into doing whatever you wanted just because you threw a little pussy my way. And now you\u2019re bitter that didn\u2019t happen. If you really want control of the Talons, you could always challenge me Zal.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, not me! Never would I challenge your insurmountable wisdom boss. Obviously you\u2019ve got things under control more than little ol\u2019 me could ever handle.\u201d Zal says with obvious sarcasm in her voice.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take over and you don\u2019t like how I\u2019m running things, why don\u2019t you just leave then? Not like I\u2019m going to try to kill you for leaving.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think the thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. You know why I\u2019m even still in the Talons? Because deep down I\u2019m actually hoping you know what you\u2019re doing. So far you\u2019re ahead, but I\u2019m just wondering for how long. Edmond was pretty much running things like you are now. Granted you are less of a violent asshole than he was, but I\u2019m seeing the same pattern.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to tell you Zal, I mean we\u2019re fucking criminals doing illegal shit. This is sort of way things are done.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Yeah, I know\u2026guess I\u2019m just starting to wonder why I ever thought this was fun. I\u2019ll leave you to your drugs and whores.\u201d\n\nZalmora walks away.\n\nYou sometimes forget that Zal is at least around fifteen years older than you now. She\u2019s probably starting to worry about age catching up. Probably didn\u2019t see herself mucking about through sewers at this age taking orders from someone a lot younger. Weird, because Vaughn doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it, but then Vaughn\u2019s never been one to make waves.\n\nAs you walk back to the Crimson hideout thinking about the future, you have to admit, it isn\u2019t as bright as you once thought.\n\nAll things considered you are doing well right now, but there just doesn\u2019t seem to be any let up on the laws being passed to turn this city into a huge prison camp. Part of that you imagine is due to the rebellion in Holgard. You\u2019re certainly glad you didn\u2019t decide to go there given what you heard.\n\nAt one time, you did toy with the possibility of going \u201clegit\u201d somehow. Like maybe buying an inn and running it. Maybe even the one your family once owned. It would sure be a complete circle if you did that.\n\nOf course it wasn\u2019t so much going \u201clegit\u201d as it was the idea of having a place to run your activities without it being in an abandoned building or recently the fucking sewers.\n\nThough that\u2019s a riskier endeavor nowadays and would result in needing to re-organize things again. Might be better to stick with your current set up. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s working.", "action_results": [{"action": "Change up the business again", "result": "Zal's got a bit of a point. This isn't exactly the most glamorous of a position and you could certainly do better than hiding out in these filthy sewers.\n\nYou've got more than enough saved and have enough connections that you could easily open up a real business front. You'd just need to keep everything low key and change a few things.\n\nThe more you think about it, the more you feel this is the right decision. The next day you gather Zal and Vaughn to discuss this new direction.\n\n\"An inn certainly sounds better than the sewers.\" Vaughn says.\n\"Well, we're still probably going to have some of our operations down there, but I figure we can at least start making an attempt to climb out of them. I'm thinking that we probably should stop dealing in Yellow Devil too.\" You say.\n\nZamora nods her head.\n\n\"I agree. The profits aren't worth the risks on that racket. A lot less sudden body meltdowns and diseased junkie whores lingering around as well.\" Zal remarks.\n\"So what about the location? Are we buying out an existing inn or starting from scratch? We could probably buy back the old place, the Troll's Breath Tavern. Edmond used to run the Talons from there before the militia raided the place and shut it down.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Wouldn't it be a little obvious, if the Talons set up there again?\" You ask.\n\"Nah, they'd never expect the same place twice! Besides, it's called the Clean Mug Tavern now. It's run by two siblings, one of them even comes here to bet on the races and fights sometimes. The place is barely scraping by, so I think they would be receptive to selling it to us for cheap.\"\n\"Instead of buying it outright, I'd suggest just getting the owners to work with us. That way nothing really changes up front, but we don't spend money and we're the ones really running things.\" Zalmora says.\n\n\"Definitely sounds like a better idea, but I know what place you're talking about, and it seems a little on the small side, I was thinking some place bigger like my old family's inn which is still abandoned. We wouldn't have to deal with anyone.\" You say.\n\"Seems like more hassle. You'd still have to buy it from the city which could present some problems. Assuming they didn't ask many questions, you'd still have to fix the place up before we could start using it proper. Wouldn't we need to get an alcohol supplier and hire people as well?\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Not really, we know more than enough folks that we could have cheap employees. Some of them are hopeless gamblers with debts in fact, so that's no problem. As for alcohol, we could easily make it ourselves and bypass a supplier. Most folks coming wouldn't be there for the booze anyway, so it isn't like we're going to need hundreds of barrels of the stuff every month. Of course your family's old inn is in a slightly better part of Klyton, so my concern would be the greater likelihood of militia just stumbling in for a drink now and then.\" Zal remarks.", "action_results": [{"action": "Buy the old family inn", "result": "It's a risk either way, but you figure owning the business outright at least makes you less concerned about somebody else fucking things up, plus you can fix things up the way you want a lot quicker.\n\n\"Guess I got an appointment with city hall or something...is that where I go?\" You ask.\n\"Yes, I believe there is some sort of department that takes care of all that stuff. We should probably get married first though.\" Zal remarks.\n\nYou and Vaughn both look at Zalmora.\n\n\"What?\" You ask.\n\"If you're married, it might not be as suspicious if you're just handing over bags of money for this property.\" Zalmora says.\n\"I don't understand why they would care. Wouldn't they just be glad to get their money?\" you ask.\n\"You been in Klyton long bossman?\" Zalmora asks sarcastically. \"Even before the council had militia crawling all over the city, this place was always a bit wary of non-citizens buying up property. Especially out of the blue. Surely you've already formed a story for all this.\"\n\"Well somewhat, but this seems like extra complexity.\"\n\"Marriage will be good idea, trust me. I've been a citizen of this city since birth. I even own a small place of residence.\"\n\"You do?\"\n\"Yes, I have for quite sometime. While I know you've been busy playing crime lord, not everyone spends all their life here at the headquarters. What I'm saying though is, with me as your wife, you won't look quite like the suspicious outsider, since despite you living here for years, you still aren't even officially a citizen of this city.\"\n\nThis is all taking you a bit by surprise.\n\n\"Wait, so when would we get married?\" You ask.\n\"Oh we can do that right now, we can just go to a church dedicated to Joachim the Pure. They usually always have someone on duty to do a quick marriage. Though I suppose if you have another preferred faith, we could go there instead, but I've never known you to be particularly religious.\" Zal says.\n\"No, I suppose that would be fine...but I dunno about this...\"\n\"Well if you got another girl in mind then marry her instead. I only suggested myself, because I can't say I've actually seen you with a steady one and certainly not one with the intelligence to go along with this plan or back up a reasonable story. If you're worried about this meaning something else, I can assure you that this is purely a business arrangement. We can always get divorced later.\"\n\nYou're really at a loss of words. You look over at Vaughn who just shrugs and just says whoever you decide to marry, he'll attend the wedding in support.\n\nTrusting Zal's judgement on this and lacking any other ideas, you end up agreeing to this set up, at which point Zalmora says great and starts dragging you to a church while busily explaining what story you should come up with when you buy the property.\n\nThe wedding itself is a whirlwind. You can honestly say you NEVER saw yourself ever getting married, let alone under these circumstances. Despite it being a \"fake\" wedding, Vaughn still gets a bit emotional saying he always saw you two ending up together.\n\nThe next step is heading to the city property clerk, which you do the next day after rehearsing your story with Zalmora who also goes over the potential questions that might be asked.\n\nAs the clerk asks you the first basic questions, you notice that he's studying you. At first you chalk this up to him being suspicious, but when you mention you wish to buy the inn because your family once owned it and you'd like to rebuild it again, he suddenly speaks out with a bit of a smile.\n\n\"I knew it! I knew I knew you from somewhere...well not you per say, but I knew your father, we had a few classes together at the university! You look almost like him! How's he doing?\" The clerk asks.\n\"Oh he's doing well. He's a doctor with his own practice in a smaller town, but he's happy.\" You say.\n\"That's good. I remember how he was always struggling to go to class and run that inn. Couldn't have been easy. Hell, I didn't even have all that responsibility and I still flunked out of medical school. Lucky I managed to land a city job. Still though, he did help me a few times during class, so he was always okay in my book.\"\n\nThe rest of the conversation goes fairly well with the clerk (Or Quincy as you learn his name) and he doesn't ask too many more questions. He just suggests that you get yourself registered as a proper Klyton citizen as soon as you can so you can participate in elections and similar functions. You hand over a large sum of coins to him and he hands over the deed and keys to you.\n\n\"Well it seems like you're a motivated young man with a plan ahead of you. Hope everything goes okay for you and your wife. We definitely need more upstanding citizens such as yourselves trying to build up this city rather than contributing to its decline. We don't want to end up like Hessla or Holgard!\" Quincy remarks.\n\"Definitely not.\" You say as you both exchange pleasant goodbyes.\n\nAs you leave city hall, Zalmora speaks up.\n\n\"Now I'm wondering if I should make a donation to Yag's temple, because his luck was definitely with us today. That went way better than I thought it would.\" Zal says.\n\"Yeah, too bad I'm not on good terms with my dad. I'd actually send a letter home to thank him for being such a good guy. Have no idea how the hell we're related sometimes.\" You say.\n\"Hmm, well luckily for you you've got his looks apparently.\"\n\"So, I guess we need to get started on setting up the new business.\"\n\"You're the boss, but I thought you'd want to go get divorced as quick as possible, given how reluctant you were to get married.\"\n\"Oh yeah. Eh, I think maybe we should stay married for now, just in case something pops up. We can always do it later, right now there's other stuff that takes priority.\"\n\"Okay fearless leader. I'm sure Vaughn will be happy to hear we're staying together for his sake.\" Zal chuckles.\n\"Hah! Yeah, what the hell was that all about?\"\n\"Vaughn's actually always been a bit of a romantic. He's never been very lucky in that regard so he gets a bit weepy when he thinks he sees it in others at times.\"\n\nYou and Zal walk to your newly acquired inn. You've seen it from the outside several times which is in fairly good shape despite it being abandoned for years. When you get inside, you find that it isn't in too bad of condition inside either though very dusty obviously.\n\n\"Yeah, I think this place will do just fine.\" You say to yourself.\n\"Shouldn't take long to get it up and running.\" Zal remarks.\n\nYou and Zal wander around a bit looking at the inn. Eventually you go upstairs and find Zal looking through one of the rooms you believe is where your father and grandparents lived. There's even still a bed and some furniture still here.\n\nYou look over at Zal who is currently bent over looking through a chest.\n\nYou then look over at the bed.\n\n\"So um...Zal...\" You start to say.\n\"Yes?\" Zalmora responds turning around.\n\"You want to celebrate our honeymoon?\"\n\nZal smirks at your offer.\n\n\"Really? Aren't you concerned that I'll be manipulating you with my magical vagina?\" Zal asks.\n\"I'm willing to take that risk.\" You say.\n\nZal looks at you for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Meh, why not?

Apparently there have been complaints that things have been getting too lax.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"See? This was useful info. And YOU got angry when you found out Vaughn was going out with a militia man.\" Zal says.\n\"Never mind all that, we gotta start cleaning shit up around here. Vaughn, I want you to start dismantling the stills and moving the tubs from the basement and into the sewers. Just glad we have a lot of already filled barrels down there. We should be good on that front. Zal, you dismantle the gambling tables and wheels and move them into the sewers as well.\"\n\"I'm not mucking about in the sewers. Those days are over.\" Zal huffs.\n\"(Sigh) Fine then get someone else to do it! Why do you have to fight me on this right now?

Don't just stand around with a thumb up your ass, go fucking help Vaughn!\" You shout in between hitting one poor employee desperately trying to get out of your way.\n\n\"Oh dear husband! Can I speak with you for a moment?\" You hear Zal shout in a sing song voice from upstairs. You hate it when she does that, because it usually means she's going to scold you or give you some unwanted advice and you really don't have time for that right now.\n\nStill, if you don't go see her now, you'll have to hear even more shit later. So you better see her now. Good thing she's still your wife, because you'd hate to take this sort of aggravation from someone you weren't fucking on a regular basis.\n\nYou stomp upstairs and meet Zal in your bedroom. You then close the door.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" You exclaim.\n\"While I'm sure you're having a good time running around abusing your underlings, I'm wondering if it's even necessary.\" Zal remarks.\n\"Of course it is! You know how this lot is, I gotta kick a little ass sometimes!\"\n\"Yes, I'm aware, but have you really thought about WHY that is? Why you have to go on these rampages every few months or so?\"\n\"Yeah, so we all don't get fucking pinched by the law!\"\n\"Exactly. I'm saying maybe it's time for us to stop worrying about that.\"\n\"So what're you getting at exactly?\"\n\"I'm saying maybe it's time to get out.\"\n\"Get out? Now? You're joking.\"\n\"Why is that so crazy?\"\n\"Because you don't walk away from this life.\"\n\"Says who? You can walk away from ANYTHING as long as you aren't in prison or the grave and either of those places are exactly where you'll be heading if this keeps up.\"\n\"If that's true, then you're going to be there right along side with me.\"\n\"Not bloody likely.

You have to admit, you're only half surprised, but this is terrible timing.\n\n\"Zal, do we really have to do this now?\" You say.\n\"Yes. Oh don't worry, I'm not going to interrupt anything, we're still moving all incriminating evidence out of here, but we're just doing it permanently.\" Zalmora responds.\n\"What the...Zal I think you've forgotten who is not only head of this organization, but who is also owner of this fucking inn!\"\n\"And I think you've forgotten that as your wife, it's also partially mine.\"\n\"My name is on the deed!\"\n\"Yeah, and you're still not a citizen of Klyton. And after the divorce, I guess we'll see who ends up with what, and if you think I won't drag you through the mud and make this hell for you, then you haven't learned very much during our time together.\"\n\nYou can't believe this. You knew you should have gotten a divorce a long time ago. You just kept putting it off for other things you thought were more important at the time. You didn't think about the potential consequences.\n\n\"You would really fucking do this to me wouldn't you? You probably planned this! Fucking bitch...\" You mutter trying hard not to do something violent towards Zal.\n\"Hey, I wasn't the one who initiated consummating the marriage multiple times.

We could go completely legit and live comfortably rather than living in paranoia of going to jail or hanging in a cage.\"\n\"I can't believe you're the same woman I met over a decade ago.\"\n\"Yeah, I already know what you think. That I'm getting old and fearful and I've lost my will for this lifestyle. Well maybe all of that is true to some extent, but I don't see why that's such a bad thing. I mean I had the thrill of being a criminal and all that, well I'm done with that part of my life now. I don't find any joy in it anymore. I grew out of it. Happens to the best of us and I don't see why you don't see the logic in going legit either. You don't seem particularly all that happy and you're constantly going into these frenzies. Can you honestly say this life is as much fun as it was say ten years ago? I mean you'd at least have less worry if you weren't living this life.\"\n\"So...what then? We just settle into life of married mediocrity and live the rest of our lives like average assholes?\"\n\"Yeah, I guess we do. Or we don't. Look, I've never been quite sure how deep your feelings have ever been towards me. To be honest I suppose I'm not quite sure of my own feelings are towards you. I like to think we do have a fondness for each other on some level. I mean we stayed married longer than some people I've know that we're head over heels in love with each other. Not exactly sure if what we have is love, but I guess in some way I think it's close, all things considered.\"\n\nZalmora continues\n\n\"That being said, if you don't want to stay together that's fine. I always thought this was going to be temporary anyway. I mean I think I could even work it out if you still wanted to manage this place. My point is though, this inn is going to be a legitimate business from now on and if you're not willing to at least go that route, well we need to say goodbye now.\"\n\"You know on my end, this could be settled really easily.\" You say.\n\"Mm, true. Could have also been settled easily on my end too, but as I already said, I like to think we have enough fondness for each other that murder isn't a serious option.\"\n\nOnce again Zal is right on that part. You don't even know why you said such an empty threat. Perhaps a last minute act of a desperate man still not sure of what he wants in the future.\n\nGoing \"legit\" isn't really going to be as easy as Zal is making out though. You would take a much severe loss in profit than perhaps she thinks. Maybe you could make it, but it wouldn't come easy. You'd have to work hard, but then you work just as hard now and have the constant paranoia added to it.\n\nOf course maybe that's the entire problem. You're working too hard period. It might not be the lifestyle, but more the location and job. You remember the more carefree years when you or you and a few others broke into a store and nicked a few items and coins, or picked the pockets of some rich merchant. You took just enough to live well for awhile and then you went out and did it all over again.\n\nNone of the stress of dealing with day to day shit of running an entire criminal organization.\n\nMaybe you just need to get back to basics and walk away from it all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Walk away", "result": "Fuck this inn, fuck the Crimson Talons, fuck this city and fuck your fake marriage. You've had enough of all of it.\n\nYou walk up to Zal and look into her eyes then you put your arms around her before kissing her deeply. She holds you tightly until you finish and slowly pull away.\n\n\"It was fun, but I think it's time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Zal, and good luck.\" You say and walk away.\n\nZalmora doesn't try to stop you, she probably knew this was a possibility.\n\nYou gather a few belonging, some money and leave the inn. You figure Zal can fill everyone in on the changes she intends to make. You can't imagine how much she's going to have to deal with, but you know Zal's got a strong will and mind, so you're sure that she'll succeed or at least come out ahead.\n\nYou make your way out of Klyton wondering where to travel. Holgard comes to mind, but there's always some sort of rebellion or power struggle going on there. You'd rather not have to deal with being in the middle of that mess. The Delantium Kingdom is at war with some other nation, so you'd rather avoid the possibility of suddenly getting press ganged or conscripted into military service.\n\nThe only other place that comes to mind is Hessla which for one thing is a whole lot closer, but it also still has a reputation of being a haven for thieves, pirates, and other criminal types.\n\nSeems like you'd fit in real well.\n\nYou first think about taking a carriage there to save yourself a walk, but then you figure you'd rather save the money. It'll be good to for you to get some regular exercise for a change as well. For several years you feel like you've just been slowly letting yourself go to pot while you were running the Crimson Talons from the inn.\n\nWith a new goal in mind, a check on your rations, your flintlock pistol and a couple daggers along with your sword, you set off.\n\nThe trip to Hessla is surprisingly uneventful. You half figured you'd at least run into a few idiots trying to rob you on the road, but other than travellers, and a few merchants, you don't encounter anyone else on it.\n\nWhen you finally get to Hessla, its actually a little nicer looking than you thought it was going to look. You expected it to be filled with run down homes with unsavory types located on every corner. If anything, the town has locations that are fancier looking than some of the better parts of Klyton.\n\nAfter spending a few days in Hessla you also learn that this place really isn't as disorderly as it's reputation would imply. Granted it's far from being as repressive as Klyton, but there actually is a \"force\" that makes sure it isn't a free for all. The Hessla Headsmen report directly to the governor who apparently is an ex-pirate that controls everything in town.\n\nIf anything the crime is less than one might think mainly because most are pirates and pillaging other places rather than here. You are surprisingly finding the place a bit easy on the pick pocket and theft front, of course a lot of folks are either half drunk or plain drunk most of the time. Also most folks don't seem to own that many personal belongings. You guess with most making their living at sea, they keep essentials on their ships, spend it all on booze and whores or otherwise live a very basic life, so despite you finding the town a bit easy pickings, you aren't getting rich doing it. Shops however are very well protected by the Headsmen since you guess Governor Tolen has a slice of all the businesses here.\n\nFights are pretty common, though they aren't necessarily always to the death like you'd expect. Just a lot of disagreement and drinking make for a rowdy town. So far you've avoided pissing anyone off and kept a low profile. You aren't sure if you're actually going to stay here long or not, but so far it's better than Klyton.\n\nWell at least you THINK you were maintaining a low profile...\n\n\"Hey you with the hood.\" A voice says.\n\nYou turn around a see a scruffy man wearing a rag on his head, shabby clothing and a few tattoos on his arms. A cutlass hangs by his side. He looks appropriately piratey.\n\n\"What?\" You ask.\n\"Just wondering if you really think you're going to be getting away with pilfering things forever in this town.\" He says.\n\"If I was doing such a thing, I'm not sure why it would matter to you.\"\n\"It doesn't, but if someone like me noticed you were doing it, I'm sure others have too. Now I know this place has a certain reputation, but punishment for thievery in this town is pretty damn severe. We might mostly be cutthroats and vagabonds here, but we don't shit where we eat. We all have to live here with a certain measure of trust. If we don't, well the whole place goes to shit now doesn't it?\"\n\nInteresting culture here. Almost reminds you of the set up you unofficially had back in your home town where they barely tolerated your thievery as long as you kept it to outsiders.\n\n\"Hmm, you seem very helpful towards a stranger. Makes me wonder if you don't have an angle.\" You say.\n\"Well, not much of one I suppose. I'm currently trying to find new recruits for my captain. Not much luck so far though. You wouldn't be interested would you?\"\n\"I'm afraid I've never been at sea, so I don't think I'd make much of a sailor.\"\n\"Everyone's gotta start somewhere, besides we're not really being picky right now. Had a big loss recently and we need all the help we can get.\"\n\"What would I be doing exactly?\"\n\"Helping around the ship obviously and the usual pillaging of coastal villages or ships. You do have some fighting skills and would have no problem with something like that I assume.\"\n\"Well, I'm not a stranger to combat and I'm not going to say that I haven't done some pretty immoral things, but I'm not raping anyone.\"\n\"Hey, that's your right. It's not a qualification for the job. More for someone else as they say.\"\n\"Hmm, I dunno. I still think my background isn't going to mesh well. I'm not really a slash and burn type. I'm more of a pick a lock and sneak out in the middle of the night kind of guy.\"\n\"Well, we could have use for that too. I remember once we raided a town that actually had a very tough safe that none of us knew how to crack. We couldn't even blow it open until we hauled one of the cannons off the ship and dragged it to the location. By the time we did get it open, the valuable contents inside were destroyed and the town had called for help from a more militaristic city that sent a strong force that chased us back to the ship. Could have all been avoided with someone like you aboard.\"\n\"Maybe. Not sure if I like the idea of taking orders though. I was already part of an organization like that once. Eventually I even ran it, but ultimately I left it because I found I preferred working on my own without a bunch of people around.\"\n\"Well, I suppose I can't convince you if your mind is already made up. Still, if for some reason you do change your mind, just head to a ship called the Steadfast. It's not the biggest ship in the harbor, but like it's name, it always gets to where it has to go and back.\"\n\nWith those last words, the man takes his leave and you're pondering this new possibility.\n\nYou have to admit part of you is curious what it would be like since you've never ever considered being a pirate. Might be an interesting change of pace.\n\nStill, along with all the other concerns you have. The guy trying to recruit you didn't exactly spin this in the best of light and most of the crew are apparently dead so what the hell is the captain like if he's getting everyone killed?", "action_results": [{"action": "Stick to land", "result": "You have enough problems on land, no need to add being surrounded by water as one of them.\n\nHessla in general seems to be a bit of a bust. You figure you'll stick around for a few more days and then make your way elsewhere.\n\nYou make a mental note that you'll need to be more careful if you pick anymore pockets though, apparently you're rusty enough in that endeavor that you're getting caught even if it isn't by the folks you're actually doing it to.\n\nUnfortunately for you your actions have already attracted attention and the day before you're about to leave, you are suddenly seized by the Hessla Headsmen who burst in the room you're staying at. Six of them in fact, though it only takes two of them to hold you down as they shackle you.\n\n\"Well, well, well, you have been busy haven't you?\" One of them says going through your pack.\n\"Another idiot outsider thinking they can just rip us off. Honestly don't know what goes through their heads. I mean we're a pirate town! Would YOU steal from anyone in a town full of fucking pirates?\" Another says.\n\"I sure wouldn't be stupid enough to stick around as long as this one did.\"\n\"So what's the damage with this one?\" A Headsman with a couple extra decorations asks.\n\"It's mostly coins, but there are a few personal items some reported stolen. Not to mention we've got more than a few people that said they saw this asshole stealing from folks when he thought nobody was watching.\"\n\"Okay. Guess we can do this here then.\"\n\nThe Headsman officer tells the others to place you into a kneeling position and put your head down. Of course you try to resist, but you just get some punches for your trouble.\n\n\"If you keep resisting, I'm not going to make a clean cut and it's going to take more than one blow to take your head off.\" The officer says as he prepares his axe.\n\nYou attempt to bargain, but it's no use. The Headsmen have heard shit like this all before and the officer eventually smashes you head with the bottom of his two handed axe. Dazed and brought low by this hit, the officer manages to nearly make a clean cut.\n\n\"Shit.\" The officer says as the axe only goes half way through your neck, which kills you though in order to take your head completely off the officer just stomps hard on the back of your head while sawing through your neck with the axe.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Be a pirate", "result": "Why not, it isn't like you got anything else important going on.\n\nThe man who was recruiting is still visible, so you hurry your pace to catch up to him. You say you'll join and he is glad you changed your mind. He mentions his name is Scully and leads you to the Steadfast.\n\nWhen Scully said the Steadfast wasn't the biggest ship in the harbor, he wasn't kidding. Not that it's a rowboat and it definitely needs a crew to sail it, but compared to some of the others you've seen, you can tell you're not exactly going to be sailing with anyone of great infamy. You imagine that's why Scully said they mostly raid small coastal villages.\n\nOther than being a smaller ship, it doesn't look like it's falling apart so it's at least in good shape. Feels weird just being on it though you don't feel sick. Hopefully you won't when it's actually sailing.\n\nYou meet a few other milling crew members, but they don't say much to you other than some grunts. One of them mentions where the sleeping quarters are and says don't worry about which hammock to take because most of them are no longer in use anyway.\n\n\"Scully mentioned something about a lot of the crew getting killed, what happened exactly?\" You ask.\n\"Mermaids.\" He mutters, but doesn't elaborate and just tells you he's got work to do.\n\nYou don't know anything about mermaids other than a few tales you've heard. You would ask one of the other crew members, but they don't seem all that talkative to the likes of you.\n\nA few hours pass as you wander the ship a bit and generally stand around doing nothing. You sort of thought someone would order you to do some work or earn your keep, but that hasn't happened yet. You almost feel like you're a passenger rather than a proper crew member. Not that you're complaining.\n\nYou eventually see Scully again who says the Captain wants to meet you. So you head back above deck where you meet the captain who doesn't look like you thought.\n\nHe's practically an old man who is having a hard time walking with a cane. He's dressed better than everyone else on the ship, but that isn't saying much since even his fancy overcoat has patches sewn on it.\n\nHe introduces himself as Captain Rifiv and says he hopes you prove to be a better crewman than the lot that got themselves killed recently. Especially since you're apparently the ONLY person Scully was able to recruit!\n\n\"What exactly happened anyway?\" You ask.\n\"Mermaids or sirens. I dunno, whatever those underwater singing fish bitches are called. We were far to the southwest and coming back from a relatively successful haul. Everything was going well, and then someone said their heard singing. I instantly knew what the hell it was and told everyone to start shoving wax in their ears and don't look over the sides of the ship because those scaly sluts got a way of hypnotizing most men and making them do their bidding.\"\n\"Sounds like logical precautions.\"\n\"You'd think so, except some of my genius crew thought they'd be heroes or something and they started looking over the side and firing their pistol into the water. Yeah, they saw one of those bitches, fell in love and before I know it, they're not only removing the wax from their ears, but they start attacking others and removing their wax or outright killing them. After it was all said and done, half of the crew was dead. Now I gotta recruit all over again and stick to places that have virtually no resistance until strength is built back up. You know what kind of places those are? Places that are poor as shit!\"\n\nCaptain Rifiv at this point starts ranting in general as he goes back to his quarters. Meanwhile a few of the crew roll their eyes and mutter to themselves.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse the captain, he just really hates set backs. It's really not as bad as all that, we'll hit a few easy targets and in time things will start picking up again.\" Scully says in a positive tone.\n\"Are we going to have to worry about mermaids?\" You ask.\n\"Oh no, we're going to be sticking to more familiar northern waters for awhile. Those lovely creatures won't be a problem where we're going.\"\n\nScully seems to be a bit lost in thought when he mentions the mermaids. Looks like they really had an effect on him, but he doesn't seem shaken by the experience. The opposite actually, like he vaguely seems disappointed that you probably won't be encountering them on this trip.\n\nWell given what the captain said happened, you at least HOPE you won't be encountering them.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 31\n\nIf you ever get back to Hessla, you swear to the gods that you're leaving and never setting foot on a ship again.\n\nWhen you left a year ago, you figured it would be a couple months maybe. You didn't know how far away all these places you're raiding were going to be.\n\nThese raids are practically slaughters and you're not particularly getting any thrill out of doing them especially since there's barely been any loot to be had. Last raids you did go on we're more about scavenging the town's fruit supplies and medicine rather than valuables.\n\nMaybe you'd get more out of these raids if you were of the rapey nature, but curse your parents for raising you to at least adhere to some sort of moral standard. Though some of them seem content on buggering each other. (And no matter how long you've been at sea, you can honestly say there's nothing that would even make you THINK about sticking it to any of this loathsome lot you're with!)\n\nYou also had problems with not just a major storm, but a few larger ships that apparently thought it would be fun to open fire on you for the shits and giggles. Doesn't help that the navigator got killed during that exchange and you got severely off course while attempting to outrun the superior ships.\n\nNot to mention repairs on the open sea with only half the crew also take a long damn time. On the plus side, you've learned your way around a ship a lot more, though you fully intend on never using this knowledge again if you can help it.\n\nAnd at least you haven't encountered any mermaids you guess.\n\nAs you lean against the ship's railing look out at the setting sun, you try to keep your own sanity by thinking of happier times with your sister or Zalmora. You hope either of them are doing a hell of a lot better than you are right now because this is without a doubt the WORST idea you ever had.\n\nRight along the idea where you left the fucking inn because you didn't want to settle down and live like some regular jerk off. Would it really have been so terrible? It couldn't have been worse than THIS.\n\n\"You're right, it couldn't be worse than this. Come back, I forgive you.\" You suddenly hear a voice say that sounds exactly like Zalmora.\n\nYou look around and then hear it again.\n\n\"Come back to me my love.\" The voice says in more melodic tone.\n\nYour head starts to feel odd and you begin to hear faint little song. You can't even make it out, it's just an ongoing tone seeping into your skull...\n\nWithout thinking you look at the waters below and see a couple of splashes and a glimpse of a large fishtail.\n\n\"Regina! I knew you'd come back to me! I'm coming darling!\" You suddenly hear a voice shout which fortunately breaks your concentration.\n\nYou look over to your left and see Scully jump over the side of the ship. This is soon followed by the Captain coming out of his quarters.\n\n\"FISH BITCHES! WAX! WAX! WAX! DON'T LOOK AT THE WATER!\" He shouts nearly falling over in the process.\n\nFortunately, Captain Rifiv was so paranoid about them from last encounter that he made everyone carry some with them at all time.\n\nScully was either wrong about mermaids not being in northern waters or you're more off course than you thought. Either way it doesn't matter because you're being assaulted by them and you're shoving wax in your ears.\n\nThe wax doesn't quite drown out the song completely, but it's helping enough that you at least don't feel like you're falling under some sort of enchantment now.\n\nCaptain Rifiv is using a telescope to look past the nearby mermaid infested waters in the hopes of finding some sort of land. Meanwhile most of the crew is busily filling their own ears with wax.\n\nUnfortunately most doesn't mean all...\n\nEven with wax in your ears you can still hear the nearby gunshot of an enchanted crew member shooting one of his fellows.\n\n\"WEAK MINDED FOOLS!\" You can hear Rifiv's muffled shouts.\n\nDoesn't take long before there is chaos on the ship and you're also fighting off your fellow enchanted crew mates. Well \"fellow\" might be too strong of a word since you didn't even like most of them.\n\nYou then hear a loud explosion coming from below, the entire boat rocks and you fall to the deck. You aren't sure what happened, but it can't be good because the smell of smoke is very prominent and while you aren't entirely sure yet, but you think the boat might be starting to sink.\n\nAs you attempt to get up, Captain Rifiv is doing his best to hobble over in your direction.\n\n\"One of those charmed fools just lit a fucking powder keg below deck! This ship is going down! Come on, help me to the emergency rowboat! I saw a patch of land to the north!\" Rifiv shouts before he stumbles to the floor of the ship.\n\nHe's having a hard time getting up, and you see yet another charmed crewman walking over to finish him off.\n\nYou look over to the emergency rowboat and you realize you could probably get to it a lot quicker by yourself.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run to the lifeboat", "result": "This is everyman for himself time, besides you didn't particularly like the old bastard anymore than you liked your other crewmates.\n\nYou run over to the rowboat, get in and deploy it.

You can't think of anything else to do, so you start shouting nonsense at the top of your lungs.\n\n\"CABBAGES, PANTIES, IT'S NOT GOT A NOSE, AND I'LL SMASH YOUR FACE!\"\n\nThis seems to work somewhat, but you start to run into trouble when you see a green hand grab the side of the boat.\n\nAnd then several more on both sides.

The mermaids are determined to stop you.\n\nYou close your eyes and draw your sword, shouting and hacking wildly.\n\n\"Get away! Get away! Back!\" You shout, but you're not really having an effect. The mermaids are easily avoiding your blind attacks and with all your wild swings you don't have the best balance.\n\nDoesn't take long before a few of the mermaids closest to your side of the boat grab you and pull. This action combined with the mermaids on the other side pushing the boat, you fall overboard into the water.\n\nDespite now losing your sword and being in the water, you still refuse to give up, you continue to keep your eyes closed and struggle against the mermaids pulling you down. It is at this point you begin to hear their laughing in your head.\n\nSomehow you actually manage to get your head above water and you open your eyes just long enough to see the faintest sign of land in the distance.\n\nThe scent of brine and fish fill your nose as you feel a mermaid latch on to your back as you try to swim away. You can do nothing as you feel scaly fingers start to dig out the wax you stuffed in your ears. This is followed by a lick and a nibble on those same ears.\n\nYour arms are feeling like anchors, but you continue to swim with a fish bitch on your back. Your head is filled with a haunting chorus that you're desperately trying to drown out with nonsensical shouting.\n\nQuite frankly you're doing better than most men would be able to in your position, but unfortunately you're only human and the mermaids are relentless.\n\n\"Join us...under the sea...everything's better with us under the sea...\"\n\nThe melodic voices continue to pierce your brain and then you feel the weirdest pleasurable sensation below.\n\nOne of the mermaids has started to undo your trousers and taken the worm in her mouth as it were.\n\nHow you're even getting turned on by this in this scenario is either a testament to the oral skills of mermaids or you had some unknown twisted desires.\n\nWhatever the reason, the mermaids are winning this one.

Now instead of just smelling fish and brine, you taste it as well as she embraces you with a kiss.\n\nWith one mermaid on your back nibbling your ear, another one swallowing your cock, and the third planting a kiss on your lips, you just let go and cease swimming. The mermaids do the rest by pulling you down.\n\nWater fills your lungs, you struggle to breathe, death soon comes and so do you as the \"hooked\" mermaid at least has the decency to finish you off before everything goes black.\n\nYour life was ended by mermaids.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Defend the captain", "result": "Maybe you're having some \"good deed\" moment during this dark hour, but the old guy actually has been more or less alright with you.\n\nYou run over to the captain and block the charmed crewman's sword with your own, then you follow up with a thrust with your dagger that's in your other hand. It sinks deep into the assailant's chest and as he slumps to the deck, you help the captain up.\n\n\"Come on! Come on! You're too fucking slow! Move your ass!\" He orders.\n\nYou start to wonder if you should have just left him!\n\nWith the captain in tow (And shouting in your wax filled ear) you make your way to the rowboat, get in and deploy it.

Don't look at anything except down at the floor of this boat!\" Rifiv shouts.\n\nBetween the wax, the captain's shouting and some more explosions from the ship as it sinks, you're not hearing the mermaids anymore. It suddenly occurs to you, maybe that's why Rifiv is still doing all this shouting. Now you're glad you helped him.\n\nStill, blocking your hearing is only part of the solution.

You don't know how the old man is holding out so well.\n\n\"Stop! No...YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE!\" You hear the captain shout.\n\nAnd then nothing but a loud splash.\n\nYou call out to the captain, but hear no answer. This causes you to row faster with all your strength while still keeping your eyes closed.\n\n\"Come to us...let go...\" You start to hear in those melodic voices again.\n\nYou can't think of anything else to do so you start singing various bawdy songs you've heard over the years at the top of your lungs as you row for your life.\n\n\"...AND HER ASS TASTES LIKE MOLASSES AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS MIGHTY FINE!

Hell, I can see someone like Vaughn being completely okay with this direction, but there are a few of the younger more ambitious members that aren't going to go along with this.\"\n\"Well that's tough shit.\"\n\"Perhaps, but they're going to be pretty mad about this and when they are, I can't say I'm going to entirely blame them. Still, we can deal with that later. Right now, priority is making this place respectable before the Klyton militia sweep.\"\n\nYou and Zal get back to that task at hand.\n\nLater on in the week after the noise has died down from Klyton's most recent repressive tactics, you call a meeting to address everyone of the new changes that are going to be taking place.\n\nIt goes well for the most part, but predictably there are complaints.\n\n\"So wait, if this place is going legit, does that mean we can't fuck the merchants that come in here anymore?\" A whore asks.\n\"You ladies can fuck anyone you want, but if you're going to be doing it here, you better be doing it for fun rather than profit. There is to be no more whoring here. If you want to pursue that line of work, you do it elsewhere. Better yet, the Klyton Kitty is hiring right now. You ladies could go there and be completely legal prostitutes at that establishment.\"\n\"What?! They wouldn't hire me and I can't compete with the bitches that hoity toity place! They're all twenty years younger, got all their teeth, magically enhanced tits, and don't have a rash on their...\"\n\"Hey look, that's not my fucking problem! The best I can do is if any of you want jobs as waitresses, I can accommodate in that respect, but you if you want to go whore, you do it on your own time and away from this place!\"\n\nAs the whores grumble, one of the more unkept employees raises their hands.\n\n\"Um, does this mean those of us who owed gambling debts don't have to work here anymore?\" One of the \"indentured servants\" asks.\n\"No! You deadbeat fuckers still owe! I'm not absolving anyone of their debts and don't think I won't still enforce that! However, only part of it will be taken out of your pay. If and when you finish paying off your debt, you can either continue working here for your full pay or go on your way.\" You say.\n\nFinally, there is the group that you were expecting the most trouble from.\n\n\"This a bunch of fucking bullshit.\" Camid exlaims.\n\nCamid is one of the younger Crimson Talons. He's always been a bit outspoken about how things should be run, but he's more or less always complied. A few other Talons with his mindset also express their dissatisfaction.\n\n\"Which part?\" You ask humoring this asshole.\n\"All of it. How fuck are we just going to walk away from all the money we're making and become regular blue collar bums? The working man is a sucker and this is just fucking stupid.\" Camid says.\n\"Yeah, I figured some of you would feel that way, so think of this as my retirement as head of the Crimson Talons. Camid, if you want the job you got it. If not, well I'm sure those of you who still want to go out and do illegal shit can decide who's going to run the organization. Good luck to you.\"\n\"I gotta say, I never agreed with all your decisions, but I never thought I'd see the damn day when you'd go fucking limp dick soft. What, so the Klyton militia assholes come sweep the place and you lose your damn balls?\" Camid remarks.\n\"Pfft, he didn't lose them, he knows exactly where they are. In his old bitch of a wife's purse!\" Another Talon remarks.\n\nAt this point Zalmora, Vaughn and a couple of the ex-Talons on your side begin to yell, but you calm everyone down.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine. You done?\" You ask.\n\"No, I'm not fucking done. This inn is a fucking Crimson Talon business! Now if you want to step down and live like some regular jerk off fine. But YOU don't get to take this with you! This is OUR place.\" Camid remarks.\n\"That's not what it says on the deed, and last time I remember I wasn't married to your ass. Look Camid, you got the damn sewers. You're gaining the bum fights, you can run whores and gambling there. Shit, you can even sell Yellow Devil again or whatever else you want, but YOU don't get this place. I was the one who scratched and worked for it. You want someplace that doesn't smell like shit and covered in slime, well you're going to have to work for it too.\"\n\nAt this point Camid and you are face to face and it's half expected that someone is going to go for a weapon. Camid is obviously severely tempted, but he's not quite confident enough to believe he'll survive the exchange.\n\n\"You're going to regret this.\" He says and then backs away slowly towards the door as likeminded folks follow.\n\nYou wave your hand away dismissively and tell your remaining people to go on with their work. You head to your office, though Zalmora and Vaughn follow you.\n\n\"I hate to say this, but I don't think Camid's going to just go away.\" Zalmora says.\n\"Yeah, I got that impression. (Sigh) This is why I didn't think this was going to just go smoothly.\" You say.\n\"Do you think we could just make a one time pay off for him to forget about us?\" Vaughn asks.\n\"Vaughn you know damn well that isn't going to work. That fucker will just see that as weakness and start demanding payment on a weekly basis. Besides, we're already going to be losing money in the near future, I'm not parting with any more than I have to.\"\n\"Well, there's always the obvious solution.\" Zal suggests.\n\"But I thought the whole point was to get away from doing shit like that. I mean I'm with you guys on going legit, but if we start making exceptions, we're not really changing are we?\" Vaughn says.\n\"So what are you suggesting?\" You ask.\n\"We get the law to work for us for a change. Look, we all know Camid isn't going to be inventive enough to pick a new location to do business. He's probably going to go right back to that old location in the sewers. All I have to do is tell Gregory about the large Crimson Talon hideout there and boom. The militia takes care of our problem. Plus you know Camid, he'll probably go down fighting.\"\n\"Who's Gregory?\" You ask.\n\"Vaughn's militia man. Got to admit, that's not a bad plan. Just...I dunno. Seems weird ratting them out like that to solve the issue.\" Zal remarks.\n\"What difference does it make as long as it gets the job done? Besides, as I said, I thought we weren't Talons anymore. There's no code of silence being broken.\" Vaughn remarks as Zal reluctantly agrees.\n\nSeems that Zal hasn't quite gotten all the \"rogue\" out of her system despite everything she's claimed. You can certainly relate, but not so much because you're against ratting them out, but more because killing them is a more final solution to a potential problem.", "action_results": [{"action": "Snitch on the Crimson Talons", "result": "It occurs to you that snitching them out to the militia is most likely the same thing as wiping them out. The Klyton militia isn't exactly known for showing restraint when it comes to things like this. And as Vaughn said, Camid will most likely be foolish enough to go down fighting and take everyone under his command with him.\n\n\"Fuck it, we're law abiding citizens concerned with the criminal element in this city. There's no reason we should risk our lives, let the militia do their job. Go talk to your boyfriend.\" You say.\n\nYour response is a bit of a surprise to Vaughn and a bigger surprise to Zalmora who both figured you'd ultimately want to take care of the problem directly. Vaughn however seems happy that his life won't be at risk now. Zal doesn't argue with your decision, but seems a little distracted by it.\n\nLater that night you address it directly before you both go to bed.\n\n\"Zal, this really is the less messy solution. If we're getting out like you wanted us to, we can't go around committing a mass murder that could potentially get one or more of us killed in the process. I mean how fucked up would it be if I died or worse, YOU died during the hit? Camid left with a little over half of the Talons, we would have been outnumbered. Let those militia assholes waste their lives. Better them than us, and as I said before, especially you.\" You say caressing the side of Zal's face.\n\"I know. I know. And I'm glad you were concerned about me.\" Zal says embracing you.\n\nIn the next few days, Vaughn lets you know that everything has been set in motion and the Klyton militia is going to launch a full scale assault on the location. They apparently want this to go so successfully they're doing their best keeping it secret. (Though Vaughn's boyfriend Gregory has a big mouth and told him everything anyway.)\n\nWithin the week you get the news from the paper about how the Crimson Talons were absolutely crushed by the Klyton militia. A big announcement is made of how the Talons are no longer a threat in the Klyton and have at last been brought down after decades of terrorizing the city.\n\nAll Talon members were killed in the raid along with several Yellow Devil junkies, whores, and gamblers who were there betting on a bum fight. But as usual nobody really cares about some dregs of society getting massacred in the process because justice has been served!\n\nYou smile and point out to Zal this success.\n\n\"See? Told you this was the best way to handle it.\" You say.\n\"Actually it was Vaughn who suggested it in the first place.\" Zal remarks.\n\"Being the boss means you always get to take the credit.\" You chuckle.\n\"Boss? We're not Crimson Talons anymore remember?'\n\"I'm still boss of this inn and I'm boss of your fine ass.\" You say slapping Zal on the ass.\n\"Oh yeah? Well you better come closer and prove that because I'm not convinced.\"\n\nYou and Zal proceed celebrate your victory and new lives as productive law abiding citizens in a physical way.\n\nYear 33\n\n\"Where the hell has Vaughn been? He hasn't come in for the past three days. Did he say he was sick or something?\" You ask.\n\"Last time I saw him he was fine. Never said anything about being sick.\" Zalmora remarks.\n\"I'm gonna have to go over to his home or something because he can't just disappear like this. We're trying to run a business here.\"\n\"It's odd for him to just disappear though. Maybe we should contact the militia on this.\"\n\"His boyfriend is a militia guy. I'm sure if it was really serious, he would have already let us know. He's probably just got some minor cold and decided it would be a good excuse to take off from work. He's done that before you know.\"\n\"So you going over to his home?\"\n\"Maybe later when things here at the inn die down a bit. Too much to do right now.\"\n\nYou spend most of your work day tending to usual business. Still feels weird at times working a real job, but you're pretty much used to it now. Being with Zal certainly has made this transition easier for you.\n\nIf only your parents could see you now, they probably wouldn't believe it. You don't think your sister would either. Your thoughts sometimes still wander towards them and wonder how they all are at times.\n\nBy night fall the inn has gotten a little quieter. Normally that's not the case, but you know there's some major party going on at the Madcap Tavern tonight so most of the rowdier folks are there. You decide this will be a good time to go check on Vaughn.\n\nYou say goodbye to Zal and leave the inn.\n\nAs you walk to Vaughn's place you pass a couple of patrolling guards. You still remember when you first came to this city it still wasn't quite as restrictive as it is now. You guess it's good you got out of the life when you did.\n\nAlong the way, a man with a full beard and mustache and raggedy clothing comes up to you.\n\n\"Hey boss, can you spare a copper?\" He asks.\n\"Don't have any. Get a job.\" You say still walking.\n\"I had a job boss, but the business got shut down by the government and in this environment, it's hard to get work.\" He says following you.\n\"Yeah, well things are tough all over.\"\n\"Well things look like they're going good for you boss. You got money, a nice business, a pretty wife even if she is a little on the older side.\"\n\nYou suddenly stop walking and it occurs to you that he isn't just calling you \"boss\" as some term of deference of social status.\n\n\"Never thought I'd get an easy chance to get you like this, you never leave that fucking inn.\" The man says in a nastier tone.\n\nYour instincts kick in, and you swing at the man, but you're a little rusty in the combat area. This man however isn't and dodges your swing and then smashes you in the face with some brass knuckles.\n\nYou feel the crunch of your nose breaking as you fall to the ground. You then feel a boot to the side of your head nearly knocking you unconscious.\n\nIn your dazed state you feel yourself being dragged into a nearby alley. You attempt to stop your assailant, but are only met with more stomps to your face. He only stops in order to take out his flintlock pistol.\n\nWhile you have no idea who this man's name is, you know he has to be an ex-Talon. Probably some young recruit that you never really paid attention to, which is probably why you never recognized him right away either, even if he does look like a vagrant now.\n\nApparently the Klyton militia wasn't as thorough as they claimed in the papers all those years ago.\n\n\"Been waiting a long time for this. Say hello to Vaughn in hell when you see him and don't worry your snitch bitch of a wife will be joining both of you soon too.\" He says and then puts a bullet in your head.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Wipe out the Crimson Talons", "result": "No point in taking chances...\n\n\"I appreciate the input Vaughn, but I believe a more permanent solution is needed here.\" You say.\n\"Well okay, but how are we going to do it? Camid just left with a little more than half the old gang. Besides us three, we only got a couple guys left and honestly I don't really have confidence in them if it's going to be a knock down drag out fight.\"\n\"There are more around guns nowadays you know. Don't need to be a good fighter to just shoot someone. I acquired one myself soon after I bought the inn.\" You say.\n\"Yeah, but Camid and his group could have the same idea. Pretty sure Camid owns one and will probably acquire more for the rest of the Talons. Plus most of them are one shot weapons. If anyone misses, it's going to come down to a real fight and we're going to be out numbered.\"\n\"Well, I guess we better make sure our aim is true shouldn't we then? Look, if this is going to be a concern, we could always go get some of those repeating crossbows. They cost a damn fortune, but...\"\n\nSuddenly Zal speaks up.\n\n\"Maybe we shouldn't risk our lives on this. It would be kind of tragic to get this far only to get brought down at the finish line.\" Zalmora says.\n\"So what are you saying? You saying you want to go with Vaughn's plan now?\" You ask.\n\"No, I'm for getting rid of them, but I just don't think we should be the ones to do the deed if we don't have to.\"\n\"Okay. So you're saying you want a hired assassin? Great. You know any? Because I sure don't.\"\n\"Yes we do. In fact you hired him already once.\"\n\nYou exhale deeply.\n\n\"And in order to hire THAT guy again, I'm going to have to deal with Mr. Fucking Reynolds and who knows what damn price he's going to ask for.\" You say.\n\"He was actually pretty reasonable last time.\" Zal remarks.\n\"He also didn't tell me everything last time. There's always a catch with him. In fact weren't you against dealing with him last time?\"\n\"I was, but that was a different time under different circumstances. I mean can it hurt to even inquire?\"\n\"No, but I wish there was another alternative.\"\n\"We could always look for Scales.\" Vaughn jokes in an attempt to lighten the mood.\n\"I don't think Scales is even alive anymore, if he was even lurking down in the sewers to begin with. I think Tom was the only one who was ever convinced of it. I mean we were in the sewers for years and never ran afoul of a supposedly territorial lizard. (Sigh) Alright, I'll go see Mr. Reynolds tomorrow and see what the price is.\"\n\nThe next day you walk into Mr. Reynolds' office.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you see a strange ogrish looking creature, but much shorter than one. In fact if it wasn't for the oversized teeth and general monstrous appearance, you might mistake it for a very muscular dwarf.\n\nYou also see Henry, or at least you assume it's Henry. He hasn't changed much since the last time you saw him, though he's sporting a few scars across his face now.\n\nFinally you see Mr. Reynolds and he certainly hasn't changed. Once again he stands up smiling at his desk.\n\n\"Well what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit from the head of the infamous Crimson Talons this fine day?\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\"I need some people killed.\" You say.\n\"Hm, straight to business I see. Okay then, I assume there is some reason why you aren't having your own people taking care of this?\"\n\"Let's just say, most of my so called people are the ones I want to have killed.\"\n\"Ah, an internal struggle? Interesting. Well, I'm not sure what you want me to do about it.\"\n\nYou haven't been here five minutes, and he's already playing mind games...\n\n\"What the hell do you think...\" You start to shout, but then you stop and then calm yourself before continuing.\n\n\"Mr. Reynolds, with all due respect, I have come here asking for assistance on this matter as I once did in the past. Your son did a marvelous job last time even if... I didn't quite appreciate its thoroughness last time. I have now come to respect it much more and I would like to implement his magnificent skills again on others that would see harm to me and my business.\"\n\nMr. Reynolds listens intently and smiles.\n\n\"I'm glad to see that wisdom has come with your age. That's good. Last time our business together was less than cordial. That's okay though, I still got paid. As I said, I would love to help you again in this matter, but I'm afraid, this isn't my call this time. Last time when Henry worked for you, you insulted his work and I'm afraid, my son takes things a bit more personal than I do. He won't work for you again.\"\n\"What?! But isn't he your employee? Can't you just order him?\"\n\"Yes, but he's also my son! Really now sir, would YOU force your son to do something he doesn't want to? Yes, business is always important, but sometimes, just sometimes family comes first. Now if Henry wants to work for you on this, I suppose we can start coming up with a price, but I don't think it's likely.\"\n\nYou look over to Henry who just gives you a cold glance before walking away altogether.\n\n\"I think there's your answer.\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\"Great. So I guess you can't help me.\" You say.\n\"Well now, I wouldn't say that exactly, I still have one employee willing to cause mayhem on your behalf.\"\n\nMr. Reynolds points over to the ogre looking creature.\n\n\"And who is that?\" You ask.\n\"Who is that? Don't you see the family resemblance? This fine gentleman is the late great Olaf's son!\" Mr. Reynolds exclaims.\n\"The late Olaf?\"\n\"Yes, it was a sad day when Olaf passed a few years ago. Died right here in the office in his sleep in fact. He will be missed. But anyway his son Olaf Jr. has been following in his father's large footsteps and I don't mind saying he's been doing a fine job for me and his own mother is very proud of him.\"\n\nYou remember that Mr. Reynolds once said Olaf was married to a halfling. You can't imagine how that birth was even possible let alone how she survived the process. It does however explain Junior's strange appearance by ogre standards. (Or any standards actually)\n\nMr. Reynolds goes on to explain that while Junior doesn't have the same size as his father or quickness that Henry has, he assures you that he has more than enough skill to do the job you require. However, unlike last time Mr. Reynolds asks for a thousand gold coins in advance.\n\nIt's a hell of a lot of money and you have no real certainty. You're starting to think you might have more piece of mind investing in some weapons and doing this yourself.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hire Junior", "result": "As crazy as this is, you know Mr. Reynolds values his word. If he says Junior will wipe out all the targets, then he'll do it. There's also the fact that you haven't completely dismissed what Zal said about failing at the finish line.\n\nYou could be as prepared as possible and still get yourself killed in the battle or perhaps even Zal would get killed. You have to admit you'd be pretty upset if that occurred. Maybe you are in love after all.\n\nSo it's with a slight reluctance that you once again take Mr. Reynolds up on his offer...\n\n\"Okay, it's deal, but I'll have to come back later with the money. I also have to do a little reconnaissance so I know where exactly to have Junior go find his targets. I'll be giving you a list of names and physical descriptions as well.\" You say.\n\"Sure. Sure. Take all the preparations you need, we'll be here. And as usual, it's been a pleasure doing business with you.\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\nYou return to the inn and explain the situation to Zal and Vaughn. Vaughn says it shouldn't be any problem to locate where Camid and the rest finally settle down at, though he says once again that it will most likely be the old sewer location.\n\n\"Why couldn't you get the other guy?\" Zal asks.\n\"I told you, personal differences. I don't doubt that this ogre...or ogrfling isn't capable of doing the job. Mr. Reynolds prides himself too much on his word.\" You say.\n\"Thousand gold pieces is a lot of money.\"\n\"Yeah, well if it keeps you...I mean us safe, it's a good investment.\" You say.\n\nZalmora smiles a bit.\n\n\"Wait, were you more worried about me?\" Zal asks.\n\"Well you are my wife. I'm not going to live like a regular jack off alone. Especially since it was your idea in the first place.\" You respond.\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Zal responds and kisses you.\n\nYou return to Mr. Reynolds' office in the next few days with the money and all the necessary information.\n\n\"Ah, quite a few of them I see. Henry really should have taken this job, he would have loved it, but there's no getting through to the boy at times. (Sigh) Anyway, yes Junior will have no problems with this. Probably can get it done tonight. Come back tomorrow and we'll have proof.\"\n\nLacking anything else to do, you head back to the inn and get back to work, which still feels weird to you. Though more than anything else your mind is preoccupied with if that ogre freak is going to be successful. You have a little anxiety that he's not going to get the job done and one of those assholes gets away only to shoot you in the back a year later just when you think everything is going good.\n\nZalmora senses your concern and later that night you try to find reassurance and comfort in her embrace. It helps.\n\nThe next morning you wake up and you head over to Mr. Reynolds' place. You notice a lot of Klyton militia patrolling about. You also come across a young boy with a bunch of papers shouting about a vigilante.\n\n\"Hey mister, you need to buy the paper today! It's special edition!\" The boy shouts.\n\"What's so special about it?\" You ask.\n\"It's a breaking story that happened just last night! Some vigilante wiped out the infamous Crimson Talons!\" The boy exclaims.\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah! My boss suddenly got the scoop in the middle of the night! Anonymous tip or something. Anyway, the details are inside!\"\n\"I don't have any money on me right now, but I might be back to get one later.\"\n\"Okay mister, but you better hurry up, these are selling fast!\"\n\nYou leave the boy and continue on your destination. When you enter Mr. Reynolds' office, he's reading the paper.\n\n\"There you are. You didn't happen to see this morning's paper did you?\" Mr. Reynolds asks.\n\"No, but I heard what the headline is.\" You respond.\n\"Heh, yes. I thought it would be the best way to deal with this one. After Henry disposed of the Bloody Smiles, people thought there was a blood stalker lurking in the woods for years. It's amazing what people's imagination can come up with.\"\n\"Mm, the imagination is a powerful thing. So where's Junior?\"\n\"Oh I gave him a much needed day off. He was up all night fighting crime I'm sure you're aware. He even took a bullet or two. Still, nothing serious for a strong young creature like himself. He did leave the proof of his deed, do you want to see?\"\n\"I can only imagine what he took as proof, but what the hell, I did pay for all this.\"\n\"It's over in the chest over there.\"\n\nYou look over to your left and see a medium sized chest. You cautiously open it and cough a bit when a smokey smell of charred flesh hits your nose. You then see a bunch of what looks to be blackened ears. Well some of them are a little more than just blackened ears and still have some of the side of the faces attached.\n\n\"(Cough cough) Shit! What did Junior do exactly?\" You ask.\n\"Well according to the paper it says the vigilante used a hellfire thrower to wipe out the Talon enclave, but there is also evidence that firebombs were also used.\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\"Wait, he burned everyone?\"\n\"Yes, and blew them up with explosives. What? Did you think that he was just a simple brute that was going to bludgeon them all with a club?\"\n\"Well, sort of.\"\n\"Oh no my dear boy. Junior isn't his father. He's very much into technology that causes the most amount of casualties in the quickest time possible. Though I believe he probably did bludgeon a few that didn't die right away.\"\n\"Judging by the number of ears here, I'm going to guess he didn't just stop at the assigned targets.\"\n\"Yes, I think there was one of those classless bum fights going on at the time when he arrived. Large crowd, but don't worry, he got them all.\"\n\"Yeah, I believe it.\" You say closing the chest.\n\nYou face Mr. Reynolds who stands up from his desk.\n\n\"So I trust our business is concluded and you're satisfied with the results?\" Mr. Reynolds asks.\n\"You said he'd get the job done and as usual, you're a man of your word.\" You answer.\n\"Well I certainly try to be and I guess this closes the chapter on the Crimson Talons?\"\n\"Guess so, or it does for me at any rate.\"\n\"Hm, well I wish you well on your new endeavor of running your inn successfully like your family once did and being just an average Klyton citizen...but then you never did officially become a citizen of this great city did you?\"\n\"Nope, never got around to it.\"\n\"Well you really should, there's a Klyton Council election coming up in a few years and I'm thinking about running. I'll need all the votes I can get.\"\n\"You're running for the Klyton Council? Why now?\"\n\"Oh I've been doing this job for so long and I think it's time to move on to bigger things. Just time for a change. Maybe you even inspired me a bit. How about that eh? Anyway, my son will be taking over this old business. He's more than qualified. Don't worry, if you ever need a loan for your inn, I've already told him that he can't refuse to do proper business with someone just because he doesn't like them. If that was the case, I wouldn't have done business with anyone at all!\"\n\nMr. Reynolds laughs, and you make a mental note that you're NEVER going to take out any sort of loan from this place no matter what the circumstances.\n\nAs you leave Mr. Reynolds calls to you one more time about how you should go register as a citizen of Klyton soon. You get the strong impression that it wasn't a suggestion so much as it was an order.\n\nLooks like you know who you'll be voting for in the future. You knew there was going to be a catch, still you suppose it's a small price in the scheme of things. Well at least you hope so.\n\nYou'll worry about it later; right now you have more immediate if mundane concerns.\n\nYour days as a rogue are over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Do it yourself", "result": "Maybe Reynolds has confidence in this guy, but you're not so sure especially at the price that's being charged. If it was Henry, you'd be fine with it because at least you know what he can do. Too bad you hurt his feelings, who knew psychopaths had them?\n\n\"I think I'm going to have to take a pass, Mr. Reynolds, but I thank you for your time.\" You say.\n\"Oh. Okay then. Well if you change your mind, you know where to find me. If you don't , well good luck to you.\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\nYou walk out of Mr. Reynolds' office and head back home. There's nothing else for it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Good thing you've still got a few shady connections who can get you some proper weapons for this fight, because to be honest you don't want to have to be rolling around in the sewers with Camid as you try shoving daggers in each other's faces. It wasn't pleasant when you did it with Tom and you didn't particularly get any enjoyment when you had to do it to Klint. Being a killer isn't something you ever really desired doing, but it's something that you've found necessary in this line of work.\n\nMight be why you saw the wisdom of following Zal's advice and decided to get the hell out. Of course you're hoping you're going to get out. You just have to do this one last thing.\n\nWhen you return to the inn, you inform Zal and Vaughn of what happened.\n\n\"So, I guess it's one last job then?\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Looks like it, if we're going to all live happily ever after.\" You say.\n\"Well, I guess it has to be done.\" Zal remarks.\n\nYou look over at Zal and touch her hand.\n\n\"Zal, you don't need to come when this goes down. I mean someone should be here to hold down the fort anyway.\" You say.\n\"How the hell can you even say that? Look, it's sweet that you're obviously concerned about me, but I'm a big girl and this whole thing was something I talked you into in the first place. So I can't just let you risk your life for this by yourself. We're all in this together. Besides, you're going to need all the help you can get.\" Zal says.\n\nYou know Zal is not going to budge on this, so you just accept it. She's right as usual anyway.\n\n\"Okay. Well let's start talking strategy.\" You say.\n\nYou tell Vaughn that you need to be certain where Camid and the rest are going to be setting up shop in the sewers. You all think that Camid is going to be predictable and set up in the old location, but you want to be sure, because you need to wipe them all out.\n\nThe next step is to acquire some repeating crossbows and even some protective armor. Granted if Camid's crew end up packing flintlocks, it might not matter, but it's better to be safe in this instance.\n\nYou spend a small fortune on gearing up for this hit. In fact by the time you get everything you think you'll need, it would have been cheaper to hire Junior, but then you know there would have been a catch. With Mr. Reynolds there is always a catch.\n\nYou, Zal, Vaughn and the rest of the old guard that was loyal spend some time practicing for the big event. In the meantime, Camid has indeed set up in the old location. He's also been busy recruiting more folks too. You have no idea if he's planning to hit you soon or he's just trying to gather strength, but in any case, you can't waste too much more time. You need to strike soon.\n\nYou make plans to hit Camid during one of the \"slower business\" days. Last thing you want is having to deal with crowds of bum fight bystanders and whores while you're trying to kill Camid and his crew.\n\nThe night before the reckoning, you and Zal spend a good portion of time together as a husband and wife do, since neither of you knows if you're going to survive.\n\nFunny that up until now, both of you spent most your lives practically dismissive of the ongoing possibility of death. This is different though. As Zal said, this is the \"finish line.\"\n\nThen the days comes. You know Camid\u2019s folks are more active at night, so it'll be best to hit them during the day when some of them are probably still half hung over. You all get prepared, descend down into the sewers and make your way to your location.\n\nIt's actually been a while since you've gone slinking around in the darkness, but you and your group try to remain as stealthy as you can. You manage to get well within the new Crimson Talon territory before one of the members suddenly stumbles upon you.\n\n\"Hey, you're not...Urgh!\" A Talon says before being interrupted by a bolt to the neck.\n\nYou manage to dispatch a few more Talons in relative silence before one of the Yellow Devil junkie whores wandering around starts screaming her head off. It isn't even about you either.\n\n\"GET OFF! GET OFF! NO! HALFLINGS! HALFLINGS ALL OVER ! THEY'RE COMING TO GET ME AGAIN! OUCH! HEHEHEHE!\"\n\nThe whore's insane ramblings are so loud it calls wanted attention, and by the time you put a bolt in her head to shut her up, your presence has been discovered and a major alarm has already been raised.\n\n\"Shit! We're being attacked! Get your gear! Move! Move!\" One of the Talons shouts.\n\nAt this point stealth is discarded altogether and all out battle takes place.\n\nTo their credit, Camid and what remains of the Talons don't try to run away. They're determined to fight it out, so at least you won't have to chase any of them down.\n\nCamid had the same idea as you did and invested in more weapons. You learn this first hand when a firebomb is lobbed at you and you have to dive out of the way and into foul waters. The noise is deafening as the explosion echoes throughout the sewers. You barely have time to find more suitable cover when you see several Talons running out from an archway firing flintlock pistols at you. Thankfully their aim isn't great.\n\nStill clutching your own weapon, you manage let loose several more bolts and catch a Talon in the process. You then trip over something and after scrambling to get back up you realize you've got blood all over you. It isn't yours however, it's part of one of your people you was blown apart by the bomb. You just tripped over his bloody torso.\n\nA slight panic comes over you not because of the obvious reasons, but more because you've lost track of where everyone else is, namely Zal.\n\nA Talon comes screaming at you with a sword raised above his head, and you shoot him twice in the chest, but he keeps coming. He gets close enough for you to see him foaming yellow shit from his mouth and blood coming from his eyes. The guy's on Devil.\n\nYou dodge the wild sword swing, trip the drug addled fool to the stone floor and then stomp the back of his head with your boot. A life ending crunch is heard and he's finally stopped.\n\nYou rush back to where you hear the rest of the fighting. Another firebomb goes off in the distance followed by someone screaming. Another one of your people, though you don't know who yet.\n\nYou finally get back to the sewer cross way near where the bum fights are held and that's when you see Vaughn on the floor attempting to tie up his bloody leg. It's in pretty bad shape.\n\n\"Camid ran into the old Talon barracks, I think Zal went after him.\" He says grimacing in pain.\n\nYou immediately leave Vaughn and run to the Talon barracks. You see a dead body on the floor and then another slumped over the bed. You cautiously go through the room and then head into where you used to have your old office. Then your heart sinks.\n\nYou see Zal on the floor with several wounds on her body. Some are from the dagger still in her stomach, another is a gunshot to the upper chest. The armor wasn't enough and despite her still struggling to stay alive you already know she's going to die soon.\n\n\"(Cough) Good...you're a...live...I got that bast..ard...\" She coughs and points over to another body in the corner which is Camid's. His brains are blown out through his eye socket and partially on the wall.\n\nYou run over to her apologizing and on the verge of tears. You knew something like this was going to happen. If only you'd done something different.\n\nZal however in her dying breaths tells you it's not your fault and at least she got to enjoy her time with you while she was here.\n\n\"Just...go live your life...okay?\" Zal says before finally closing her eyes forever.\n\nRight now, part of you doesn't feel like living your life is going to be worth it without her around. You know you'll eventually get over this and move on, but it's not going to be for a long time.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Seize the old Talon tavern", "result": "Now that you're rethinking this, the less paper work the better and you are probably going to be better off located in the poorer area of the city too.\n\n\"So who is this hopeless gambling case who owns this property exactly?\" You ask Vaughn.\n\"His name's Carl and you probably have seen him, you just didn't know his name. He's a short grubby guy. His face almost looks a little orcish, but he smells worse than one half the time.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Oh, him? That disgusting little grub owns a tavern? Thought he lived here in the sewers. In fact I was wondering why he wasn't in the ring fighting with the other bums.\" You say.\n\"Disgusting is right, the little shit tried to grab my ass once and made a bunch of stupid sexual innuendo. He's lucky I didn't cut his dick off and only stabbed his hand.\" Zalmora says.\n\"Hm, well I suppose if he gives us any shit, we know who he's already afraid of. You said he had a sibling, what's the story on that one?\"\n\"Um, dunno much. I think her name's Annie and I do know she swears more than the three of us put together. She came down here to retrieve her brother a couple times and every other word that came out of her mouth was some variation of fuck.\" Vaughn says.\n\"Well that's very interesting, but I was wondering if she was likely to give us any shit if we try to muscle in on the tavern. I mean are we going to have to take care of this bitch or not?\"\n\"I dunno, I mean she's got a mouth on her, but she's just a skinny thing and I can't see her giving us any trouble if we seriously threaten her.\"\n\"Well, it would seem the goal is clear. I'll go have a talk with these siblings about the facts of life.\" You say.\n\"You don't want anyone to come with you?\" Zal asks.\n\"Nah, it'll be fine.\"\n\"As you say.\" Zal says almost implying that you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThe next day, you enter the Clean Mug Tavern which can't possible be true given that you feel like you need to jump in a river just by setting foot in the place. Which is saying a lot considering you do most of your business in the fucking sewers.\n\nThe floors are sticky with filth and the walls in this dim light don't seem much better. A family of rats scurry past you as you walk further in making you wonder if you've left the sewers at all.\n\nThe place is empty save for a few drunks face down on tables. A frowning thin girl with a pale complexion sit behind a bar. It's already apparent she isn't welcoming.\n\n\"What the fuck do you want?\" She asks.\n\"Do you greet all your potential customers that way?\" You ask.\n\"Don't fucking like it, you can get the fuck out.\"\n\"Yeah, you must be Annie. Where's your slug of a brother?\"\n\"Probably fucking a whore instead of taking care of fucking business as usual. And how do you know my fucking name? Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you want?\"\n\"I'm your new business partner. Or in your words, I'm your new fucking business partner.\"\n\nAnnie's frown somehow manages to turn even further downward as she just stares at you.\n\n\"Alright, before you go on a fuck tirade, I'll try to explain it so simple that you'll understand.\"\n\nYou explain that her and her brother's tavern is now going to be a front for Crimson Talon operations. In exchange you'll fix this place up and make it at least somewhat more appealing. The tavern will be making more money with the influx of people that are sure to come in, but you'll be taking most of the profits of course.\n\n\"So wait, you're gonna just fucking come in and take over completely? You get the fucking tavern and all the fucking money? What the fuck do we get?\" Annie asks.\n\"You get your health for one thing. Which I assume would be the most important. However, if it isn't, I would still point out that YOU will most likely still be making more of a profit than you are now with this rat palace. Also, the tavern will still be legally yours. We'll just be using it and basically paying for the place. Now, that should make you feel a little bit better about this non-negotiable deal shouldn't it?\"\n\nAnnie is silent again for a moment and still frowning. Her eyes look down briefly, which implies she might be thinking about going for whatever weapon she has stashed under there. You still aren't worried, because even if she doesn't see the wisdom of the deal, you're confident that you'll be quick enough to reach over the bar and stab her first.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't come to that.\n\n\"Well, looks like I don't have much of a fucking choice. I imagine even if I killed you, some other fucking asshole would just take your place and probably wouldn't be as fucking understanding as you.\" Annie says.\n\"Glad to see you're a woman of forethought. Anyway, I'll be back later and I'll inform you with more details as we get set up. I trust you can tell your brother about this business when he shows up?\" You say.\n\"Yeah, but I can I ask for ONE fucking request?\"\n\"I'll entertain the thought. What is it?\"\n\"Well since I figure I'm already getting fucked, the least you could do is do me proper.\"\n\nNow you're silent for a moment.\n\n\"Um...what exactly are you saying?\" You ask, sort of already knowing, but just wanting confirmation.\n\"I'm fucking saying, if you're already bending me over and horse fucking me in this business endeavor, you could at least do it to me literally as well.\" Annie says.\n\"...Are you being serious right now?\"\n\"Of course I'm being fucking serious! You're young, easy on the eyes and I don't get out much. Besides, I know I'm not that fucking ugly.\"\n\nThis is just bizarre. You didn't expect this sort of request. Annie's correct in that she's not ugly, but her stringy greasy looking hair, plain looks, and emaciated appearance aren't exactly traits that come to mind when you're thinking of attractiveness. Though apparently she finds you attractive which is always a nice ego boost.\n\n\"Well...um...shit..fuck it. Alright. Not like I got anything better to do.\" You say.\n\"The sad thing, is that's the best offer I've had in years.\" Annie remarks a bit despondently.\n\nHell, now you feel like you're doing a good deed.\n\nAfter giving Annie a thrill big enough to cause her to actually stop frowning for a moment, you head back to the sewers where you feel a lot less dirty.\n\n\"So how did it go?\" Zal asks.\n\"It went well. We aren't going to get a bunch of problems.\" You say.\n\"You talked to them both?\"\n\"Nah, just the sister. The brother was elsewhere. Pretty sure she was the one to deal with anyway though since she's the main one running that place. I satisfied her.\"\n\"Satisfied?\"\n\"Erm, I mean dealt with her. She won't be a problem.\"\n\"Okay...so are we moving everything there then?\"\n\"Well I imagine the bum fighting will still be held down here, but that tavern is big enough to have gambling games and whores set up. We're really going to have to fix that place up first though, because as it stands now, the place isn't much better than the sewers.\"\n\"Damn shame. I remember Tom saying the place was fairly nice back when Edmond ran the Talons out of there.\"\n\"It will be again and in time when we get a few more recruits and things are running smoothly we can do the same thing with another place.\"\n\nWith the tavern secured, you take your next steps in this plan.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 26\n\n\"What?!\" You exclaim in disbelief.\n\"Carl and Annie's mother showed up at the tavern last night and pitched a bitch. I mean she raised holy hell. Literally too. She had a book of Joachim in hand the entire time.\" Vaughn says.\n\"So did she do any actual physical damage?\" Zalmora asks.\n\"Not really. She mostly beat the shit out of Carl and Annie, saying she didn't scrimp and save for the tavern just so they could turn it into a den of sin. She then left saying if they didn't take care of this, she would.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Wait, so do the siblings actually even own this place?\" Zalmora asks.\n\"Apparently it's always been in their mother's name and she did run it briefly before she started having health problems and let her children run it instead. She mostly stayed out of the day to day operations, but every now and then she leaves her home to drop in on her children...and well you know the rest.\"\n\"I don't get it. Why would a Joachim fearing woman buy a tavern, let alone let her children run it in the first place?\"\n\"Apparently that's sort of a newer development. The old lady has gotten a bit religious over the past few years. Probably brought on by failing health.\"\n\nYou just put your face in the palms of your hands.\n\n\"Why the hell didn't either of you fucking idiots know any of this? And more importantly why didn't you stop the old bitch?\" You ask.\n\"ME? This was all Vaughn's idea and YOU signed off on it! I've barely been involved in it! All you've had me do is seeking out other potential taverns to take over and monitor the bum fights from time to time. I haven't stepped foot in that damn tavern since we first set up shop there! Besides, aren't you regularly fucking that skeletal bitch that runs the place anyway? Figured you pumped her for information along with just pumping her.\" Zalmora exclaims.\n\"(Sigh) No. I'm not fucking Annie. That's an ugly rumor that delusional bitch probably started in the first place. I can see I'm going to have to set her ass straight.\"\n\"Hm, if you say so.\" Zal says giving you a look like she doesn't quite believe you.\n\nYou knew it was a bad idea to pity fuck Annie a few more times.\n\nIn any case, Zal's right in that it's not her fault at all, this is mostly Vaughn's fuck up, but really it's yours as well because you really should have learned all the facts first. You are the one running the Talons after all.\n\nYou exhale deeply and get up from your desk.\n\n\"What's the old woman's name and where's she live?\" You ask.\n\"Her name's Wendy and she lives in a small house over by the Greenwood park. I think it's like the only house still standing there since most of the others are abandoned.\" Vaughn says.\n\"I'll find it.\" You say.\n\"Wait, are you going to go over and kill her?\" Vaughn asks.\n\"Well I was going to see if I can find a diplomatic way of dealing with this, but if murdering the old lady is what it takes then so be it.\"\n\"Hold on, maybe you should send someone else. I mean maybe I could go take care of this.\" Zal says.\n\"No, because as you have already pointed out, this isn't your fault at all and I don't trust Vaughn to not fuck it up, so I'll do it myself.\"\n\nYou head over to Wendy's home, wondering how you're going to handle this. You really don't want to murder an old lady if you can help it, but if that's what it takes then that's what's going to have to happen. Given that she's a follower of Joachim though, you don't hold out much hope that blood isn't going to be shed.\n\nEventually you get over to Wendy's house and knock on the door. You hear a lot of grumbling as you wait.\n\n\"Hold on, hold on, I'm...by Joachim, you haven't aged!\" a short old woman exclaims when she opens her door.\n\"Um, thanks?\" You say a bit confused.\n\"What are you doing here? Are you in the city just for a visit? Where is Eliza? Are you still married to her?\"\n\"Wait, who do you think I am?\" You ask.\n\nWendy mentions your father's name and squints a bit as she looks closer at you.\n\nYou realize, this is one of the waitresses at your father's old inn! You remember your mother mentioning working with her in some of her old stories to you and your sister, but then you never did pay much attention to those.\n\nMaybe you can work this in your favor after all.\n\n\"No, I'm afraid you've confused me with my father. But my mother and father are still married and well.\" You say.\n\"Oh. That's good. They were a nice couple, if a bit slow on the uptake as far as how they really felt about each other. Still, I guess it all worked out, given that you're here. You look a lot like your father. Well come on in and tell me what brings you to my doorstep.\" Wendy says.\n\nWendy invites you in and tells you to excuse the mess as she doesn't do much cleaning nowadays. You find a chair to sit in and she does likewise.\n\n\"So. What would the son of my old employer want with me?\" Wendy asks.\n\"Well, after working for so many other people, I've sort of come to the conclusion that I'd like to try to work for myself for a change. I was sort of inspired by the old family business and I've done a lot of research on the matter along with asking my parents questions of course. I got quite a bit of money saved up from over the years and I was looking for a place to buy and get a business started. I thought your tavern would be a good place.\" You say.\n\"My tavern? You've been there?\"\n\"Oh yes. When I was shopping around for potential places. Your children...Um...Carl and Anika...\"\n\"Annie.\"\n\"Yes, Annie said that it was actually yours and if I wanted to buy it, that I should speak with you. They mentioned how you used to work for my father too, so I figured I'd at least make an offer to you first before anyone else.\"\n\"...Mmm hmm...but why didn't you just buy your old family inn? I believe it's still abandoned and for sale surprisingly enough.\"\n\"Heh, I tried, but apparently the city is planning to knock it down and build something else there. Would have been nice, but I got here a little too late it seems.\"\n\"Uh huh...let's cut the bullshit.\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"You think I was born yesterday? You may be the son of Eliza, but you sure ain't anything like her OR your father. They were decent people. While YOU are a lying criminal scumbag just like my worthless children. It seems a little too fucking convenient that you show up on my doorstep the day after I find out what's going on at my tavern. I'm not really surprised by my son Carl. He's a miserable gambler with a weakness for whores. Annie, however I thought at least had a little more sense. Guess you're really putting it good on her if she's gone along with this shit.\"\n\"I assure you, I don't...\"\n\"Don't insult me with more lies. I already saw what was going on at my tavern. In all her hysterics yesterday, I heard Annie babble to me about how she has a handsome man that loves her more than I ever did. I have to imagine that's probably you since you stand out a bit from the rest of the unwashed rabble I saw in that den of inequity. Ungrateful little bitch. Well, whatever charms you think you have ain't gonna work on me, I'm a Joachim fearing woman! Tch. Gotta say I never thought your parents would raise someone so far from the path of righteousness.\"\n\nThe jig is up.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm a big disappointment to them, but as you said, let's cut the bullshit and come to some sort of arrangement. How much you want for the tavern?\" You ask.\n\"And why would I sell to a heathen like you?\" Wendy retorts.\n\"Because I already own the place in all but name already. Look, the place was barely making any money to before I showed up and now that you know the truth, you won't want to have any more connection to the place. So I'm making you a generous offer since you're an old family friend to buy it. Two thousand gold pieces. You know that this is the best offer you're going to get and let's be honest, you don't have a choice. What are you going to do? Report us to the militia? We'll be gone...or at least I won't be around and all that's going to happen is the city of Klyton is going to arrest your children and seize the place, leaving you with no steady income whatsoever.\"\n\nMuch like her daughter, Wendy's wrinkled face frowns at you in silence. She doesn't like this, but her silence is a good sign. It means despite her belief in Joachim she's still pragmatic enough to consider your offer.\n\nYou just hope she isn't TOO much like her daughter because...\n\n\"Five thousand gold pieces for the tavern.\" Wendy says.\n\"Five thousand?\" You answer\n\"That's my price. I might be old and not in the best of health, but two thousand isn't going to sustain me until I die. I know a big time crime lord such as yourself probably has that kind of money.\"\n\"Five thousand...seems a bit greedy. Isn't that against the will of Joachim?\"\n\"First of all, you don't know shit about his glory, so don't think to say shit to me about it. Second of all, some of that is going to his church so at least some good can come out of this wickedness.\"\n\"Ah, I see. Buying your way into the afterlife. Whatever. I don't care, but I'm afraid five thousand is fucking unreasonable.\"\n\"And that's still my final offer. You don't like it, well you better go crawl in whatever hole you hide in from the militia because I am NOT going to let you use the place while it's still in my name. So it's five thousand or you're leaving my tavern either peacefully or by the militia. I got nothing to lose. You're in this position because YOU chose a life of wickedness. Deal with the consequences.\"\n\"I don't think you realize the position YOU'RE in.\" You warn.\n\nWendy starts to smile, followed by a laugh.\n\n\"What? You're going to kill me? Pfft. I'm already dying with how my health is going and my three kids are fucking disappoinments. As I said I have nothing to lose and my soul is prepared for Joachim's eternal glory. You won't get away with it anyway, Joachim always finds a way to punish the wicked.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Pay the money", "result": "The old bat drives a hard bargain and she's called your bluff.

You got me by the short and curlies. I'll pay your damn price out of respect for all the years of service you gave to my family.\" You say.\n\"Yeah, see what that got me. Still, I'm glad to see that you have some sort of morality. Maybe there's still hope for you. Remember it's never too late to turn your soul over to Joachim.\" Wendy says.\n\"I'll keep that in mind. I'll be back tomorrow, you just have the deed.\"\n\nYou leave Wendy's house and return to your sewer headquarters. You're starting to wonder if you shouldn't have just bought your family's old inn in the first place. At least it would have been big enough for you to make your home in.\n\n\"So how did it go?\" Zal asks.\n\"She's willing to sell, so no murder was necessary.\" You say.\n\"Really? Wow, I'm actually impressed that you managed to talk a religious old lady into working with you...or did you just fuck this one into submission too?\"\n\nZalmora starts laughing immediately after her comment. Vaughn stays silent though.\n\n\"Fuck you Zal, just fuck you.\" You say.\n\"Interesting, that wasn't a denial.\" Zal remarks with a smirk.\n\"Hey boss, I just want you to know I'm not judging you if you did. We all have our own carnal desires and I know you seem to like the older ladies. I mean between Annie and Zal...\" Vaughn starts to say.\n\"What the fuck Vaughn, don't put me in the same category as that weathered corpse!\" Zal exclaims suddenly getting angry.\n\"Both of you shut the fuck up, in fact don't the pair of you got some work to do? No wonder things are falling to shit here.\"\n\nZal and Vaughn walk off, leaving you alone for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day you go over to Wendy's house and complete the transaction.\n\n\"Here you go heathen.\" Wendy remarks handing you the deed.\n\"Thanks hypocrite.\" You answer and start to leave.\n\nWendy isn't quite finished yet though and she grabs your arm before you leave.\n\n\"Hey, I wasn't joking yesterday when I said it isn't too late to seek Joachim's forgiveness. Maybe your wicked deeds are profiting you today, but there is going to come a reckoning someday and you'll have to answer for your evil ways. Out of respect for your parents, I urge YOU to turn from this path before it's too late.\"\n\nYou pull your arm away.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll get right on that.\" You say and walk off.\n\nEventually you return back to your sewer headquarters and spend some time on inner contemplation.\n\n\"(Sigh) I really need to get the hell out of these sewers.

We can add another tavern to our list.\" You say.\n\"Did we really need another one?\" Zal asks.\n\"That's a silly question Zal. We can always use more income and taverns provide the best cover.\"\n\"I dunno, I just think we're extorting too many businesses within a short period of time. I mean have you forgotten that the Klyton militia is still pretty active?\"\n\"So what're you saying? You want to go back and hide in the shit filled sewers like we were doing? I thought you'd be happy to get out of there completely since you were the main one bitching about it. Look, as long as we keep a low profile we're fine. We've been doing well so far right?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm sure Edmond thought the same thing once.\"\n\"Here we go with that. Look Zal, we've been through all this before three years ago. I actually took your advice and you're still not happy, so let me make this easy for you. You're out.\"\n\nZal's face is one of surprise. Vaughn is a little surprised as well.\n\n\"What? Are you serious?\" Zalmora says.\n\"Yes, I'm fucking serious. I'm sick of your bitching, your sarcasm, your smart ass remarks that attempt to undermine my authority in general. You seem to think because we once shared a bed together that somehow allows you to say anything you want to me. Combine that with the obvious fact that you don't really have the stomach for this business anymore, well there isn't much use for you is there? So with all respect and no ill will, goodbye Zal. You were a valued member of the Crimson Talons while you were part of us, but your services are no longer required.\"\n\nZalmora takes your words in silence. She looks at you with a mixture of feelings and you can't quite tell if it's betrayal, anger, sadness or even relief. She just walks over to you and touches your face before leaving.\n\nAbout a few minutes after she leaves, Vaughn speaks up.\n\n\"Come on boss, aren't you going to go after her? You're just mad because you were feeling good about how things are going and in typical Zal fashion she was a bit of a downer. You know that's how she is. I also know Zal and she's just putting on a brave front. She really doesn't want to leave any more than you really want her to leave. It's pretty obvious you value her advice, even if she is difficult at times.\"\n\nYou look over at Vaughn. You've never known him to be that insightful, but he's hitting all the points right now.\n\nYou stand up.\n\n\"Aw hell...you're right. She probably hasn't gone too far yet. Vaughn can you... What the hell is going on out there?!\" You say suddenly hearing a bunch of noise outside the office.\n\nYou open up the door and everyone is running around attempting to avoid the horde of Klyton militia piling through the front door. They aren't fucking around either because they're outright shooting or stabbing folks that are only barely resisting. Annie and Carl from what you see have already given up and are kneeling on the floor with their hands behind their heads.\n\n\"Oh shit! Vaughn! Help me barricade the door! We gotta get the fuck outta here!\" You shout and slam the door shut.\n\nAs you and Vaughn push the desk up against the door, you already hear the crashing behind it. From the other side, you hear your name being called out telling you to surrender or face consequences.\n\n\"What kind of logic is that? If I surrender, I'm going to face the consequences too. Vaughn, open up the trap door, I'm going to get as much as I can from the safe.\" You say.\n\nAfter Vaughn opens up the escape hatch to the sewers, you try to maintain your cool as you fiddle with your safe and unload its contents all the while axes, halberds and bullets are piercing the barricaded door.\n\n\"Come on! Leave it! Let's just go!\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Go on ahead, I'm almost done, I'll be right behind!\" You say waving Vaughn away.\n\nYou finish packing and are heading towards the escape hatch when the door is finally partially broken. A bullet whizzes by you and into the wall. You whirl around to fire your own flintlock at your assailants. You hit one, but then are shot yourself. It's only in the leg, but given how close you are to an open hatch, you fall back, slip and tumble down it.\n\nYou probably would have broken your neck had Vaughn not been in the way to break your fall. Of course you probably surprised the hell out of him as he was climbing down the ladder.\n\nThe pair of you land hard on the stone sewer floor with you being right on top of Vaughn.\n\n\"Shit...my leg...my fucking leg...Vaughn I might need you to...Vaughn?\" You say and slowly move yourself off of him.\n\nYou check, and you see his head at an unnatural angle. He's broken his neck.\n\n\"Damn it, Vaughn...\" You say and then another bullet flies near your head and into the floor.\n\nOne of the militia men is firing at you from the top of the hatch. Seeing that Vaughn still has his own pistol holstered, you grab it, point upward and fire. You somehow manage to hit the guy in the face and then you realize the folly of that as you desperately roll out of the way of his falling body.\n\nThe militia man's body partially hits Vaughn's and the stone floor. At this point you're just trying to get away which is difficult with one good leg.\n\nWith some effort you manage to stand yourself up and hobble away. You already hear several of the militia climbing down the ladder and shouting.\n\n\"SHIT!\" You shout as your wounded leg gives way due to lack of strength and a slimy stone floor. Falling on your face, you already know you aren't getting away at this rate.\n\nBest case scenario, you get taken in, tried and instead of executing you, they shove you in one of those cages where you first found Tom.\n\nMAYBE if you're lucky you might be able to pick the lock and escape, but you doubt if you'll just have access to your tools. Maybe you could do what Tom managed to do and convince a wanderer to release him...but then again you know how that situation ultimately ended for him.\n\nActually, if you knew letting him out was going to lead to this end result, you would have left him there. Who knows, maybe he would have even been better off since the other Talons were supposed to get him out eventually.\n\nIt's all a very long shot anyway and you've already come to the conclusion that you're not going quietly.\n\nThe strange thing in all this is now you're glad you told Zalmora to leave when you did. You hope she managed to evade capture. You think she probably had enough time to run before the militia converged on the place.\n\nYou're kneeling on your good leg and leaning up against a wall in an attempt to get back up, when the militia finally catch up to you. You feel a hard blow to your back and you crash to the floor. Several militia surround your prone body.\n\n\"We'll get promotions for this!\" You hear one exclaim.\n\"Hope they also have an award for getting wounded in the line of duty.\" You remark and pull a dagger stabbing him in the foot.\n\nIt's all the excuse the militia needs to start running you through repeatedly with their spears and swords and stomping your head into mush. You're a holey bloody mess by the time they're through.

Where's your Joachim now?\" You sneer and easily end her life with a dagger to her throat.\n\nIt's done and you quickly make your way out of the house and return to your sewer headquarters.\n\n\"So how did it go?\" Zal asks.\n\"The old bitch is dead. Vaughn head over to the house with some people and search it for the tavern deed and anything else valuable. I would have done it myself, but I wanted to distance myself from a crime scene as soon as possible obviously.\" you say.\n\"Oh. Okay, did you want the body disposed of too?\" Vaughn asks.\n\"If you want to be bothered I suppose you could, but I'm not really worried about the Klyton militia tracking me down for it. I mean if they ever did find me, it would be for a whole bunch of other shit first.\"\n\nVaughn leaves and it's just Zalmora who keeps looking at you.\n\n\"What?\" You ask.\n\"Nothing. Just still hoping you know what you're doing.\" Zal remarks.\n\"(Sigh) Damnit, why do you ALWAYS do this? Something gets taken care of and YOU always say something that suggests different and completely undermines morale?\"\n\"Alright fine, I'll stop being a downer. I just want you to be more careful. I mean I didn't notice it immediately, but you've got some blood on your clothing and even your hands. I certainly hope you were careful about being seen.\"\n\"Yes, yes, of course I was. Sheesh, you act like this I'm some damn neophyte at this. I'm not worried about the fucking militia.\"\n\"Okay. Apologies. You got everything under control, I'm done with my caution.\"\n\nZalmora takes her leave and you're free of her usual mother hen routine. You getting a little tired of that occurrence.\n\nYou're also getting a little tired of these sewers. You're supposed to be the head of a budding criminal Empire. As soon as you can, you're clearing out one of those gambling game rooms at the tavern and making it into an office.\n\nOne month later...\n\n\"Where the hell are Carl and Annie? I haven't seen either of those losers for days. Did they still want jobs at this place? Because I can easily get any slob to replace what they do. And in Carl's case that ain't much to begin with.\" You say.\n\"Well maybe their taking their mother's...um disappearance hard.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"I doubt it. There was no love between her or them. Wendy distinctly said they were disappointments to her when she tried to get more money out of me. Besides, it's been a couple weeks since they discovered she was missing and they didn't seem all that concerned before.\"\n\"Maybe it's a delayed reaction. Like they figured she'd show up by now and because she hasn't, reality is setting in that she might not just be missing, but she might be dead.\"\n\"Nah, Annie spoke to me about a few days before she stopped coming in. She didn't give that impression. The opposite actually.\" Zalmora remarks.\n\"Oh? Never known you two to talk. What did she say exactly?\" You ask.\n\nZal smirks at your request.\n\n\"She told me she hoped that her mother actually WAS dead, because then she would never get in the way of your love for her.\" Zal chuckles.\n\"Fuck you Zal, just fuck you.\" You say.\n\"I'm serious! She actually said that to me!\"\n\"I told her to stop spreading that fucking rumor! That's it, if she does show up again, she's out on her ass. If she gives me shit about that, she'll join her mother! I'm not having her telling delusional lies about me anymore!\"\n\"I know you keep denying and I'd really like to take your word. However, she's already told me about some very intimate things about your body and I think I'd know if she was lying or not.\"\n\"The crazy bitch walked in on me changing once and she made up some twisted fantasy!\"\n\"Nice save. Okay, have it your way.\" Zal remarks and takes her leave before you start yelling at her. Vaughn not wishing to be your second choice for verbal abuse takes his leave as well.\n\nTwo weeks later...\n\n\"Camid, I want every able body we have to look for Vaughn AND Zalmora! They didn't just fucking disappear and if the militia pinched them we would have known about it! I dunno what the fuck's going on, but if we got some rival organization like the Ebony Claw Syndicate setting up shop here, we need to get on this quick!\" You shout.\n\"Yes sir!\" Camid remarks before leaving.\n\nThis has been stressful week. Both your best lieutenants have gone missing and in this line of work, that probably means they're dead. You'd probably feel a little worse about it, if you weren't so angry. Who the hell is doing this?\n\nYou didn't think much about it when Carl and Annie disappeared. If anything you were somewhat happy you didn't have to deal with them anymore. This however is something different. You've taken to hiding in the sewers again, with guards constantly posted outside your office to make yourself less of a potential target.\n\nIn fact, you've actually gotten very paranoid recently that maybe it isn't something of this world doing this, but maybe, just maybe Wendy's warning was right...\n\nDays pass and you still have no idea who is doing this. Soon Camid stops reporting in and you start losing Talons. With your loss of manpower, you aren't able to run much of anything.\n\nEventually it's just you as the Talons still left alive have fled your side fearing that they'll be next on this list of mysterious disappearances. You have lost everything and the militia wasn't even involved.\n\nYou end up spending most of your days in the sewers jumping at shadows and armed all the time. You barely sleep and when you do, you still wear heavy armor that you invested in after Vaughn and Zalmora first disappeared.\n\nHowever, the fateful day comes when you do finally have a sound sleep, when you open your eyes however, you are met with a grisly sight on the floor of your room.\n\nYou see the bloody heads of the various people that have gone missing. Carl, Annie, Vaughn, Zalmora, Camid and others under your command.\n\nYou reach for your weapon and then a figure loom over your head punching you in the face several times. He then proceeds to break your arms, before dragging you off your bed and then breaking your legs. Bones stick out of the skin, your screams are loud and the pain is great, but you're in the sewers and there will be no help.\n\nIt isn't until all your limbs are broken that you finally get a good look at the person doing this to you.\n\n\"...you...\" Is all you can utter.\n\"I've taken everything away from you. Now I'm sending you to a very dark place and I'm going to enjoy sending you there.\" Henry whispers as he starts stripping off your armor.\n\nYou never thought about it at the time, but only now do you remember Wendy mentioned she had three children.\n\nYou also remember Mr. Reynolds saying Henry's mother's name was Wendy.\n\nOdd that Carl or Annie never spoke of him at all, but perhaps they were too scared of him to even say his name and it's easy to see why.\n\nPerhaps Wendy never had any love for this ruthless monster of a son, but it's apparent he had love for her...or perhaps this was just the excuse to kill you. After all he never liked you after you criticized his work.\n\nWhether this is somehow the twisted divine work of Joachim or just a coincidence of a son seeking revenge on his mother's killer, it hardly matters. How he learned that it was you who did the deed doesn't matter either.\n\nWhat matters is Henry keeps his promise of enjoying sending you to a dark place because he keeps you alive a whole three days torturing the shit out of you before your body just gives out.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Stick with what you are doing", "result": "The sewers are good enough for you. If you start trying to set up shop up top, you're just going to bring down the heat eventually.\n\nYou've got a good thing going on and nobody fucks with you down here. If worst comes to worst, you're confident that you could easily lose the militia if they actually ever made an effort to patrol down here.\n\nStill, maybe you could figure out a way to make this place somewhat less...well like a sewer. You already have made a base in the best abandoned area you can find though. You suppose you could start manually expanding underground further away from the sewers themselves of course that would be a pretty extensive and expensive undertaking and it isn't like you're familiar with the details of excavation.\n\nAlthough...\n\nThis city used to have a fairly large active miner population once. In fact your family made money serving them at their inn. At some point long after your parents had left the city and the inn closed down, the mining trade dried up completely in Klyton for a variety of reasons resulting in a lot of unemployed miners.\n\nIn fact some of the bums in your fights are ex-miners. You wouldn't want to rely on just them though, but surely you could scour the city for other ex-miners down on their luck or working jobs they hate. They probably would work cheap. You suppose if you really needed more you could shell out the money for some outside help, but you'd rather keep the costs as low as possible.\n\nLater when you approach Zal and Vaughn with this idea, they're caught off guard by this plan, but don't seem put off by it. Well Vaughn doesn't at least. Zal of course has her usual concerns.\n\n\"Okay, I know that look. Out with it.\" You say.\n\"It's just...well do you think this is even feasible?\" Zal asks.\n\"I'm not saying it's not going to take effort, but again this is a long term plan. I mean going up top, trying to set up false businesses and store fronts is just not going to work in Klyton. The place is just too damn repressive, but we all know people still WANT to do illegal shit like whoring, drugs, gambling...\"\n\"Erm, actually all those things are legal in Klyton.\" Vaughn interrupts.\n\"(Sigh) You know what the fuck I mean! All that high priced shit is easily accessible for the rich folks, but WE cater to the poor and who needs affordable distraction more than they do?\"\n\"So...wait. Are we defenders of the down trodden now?\" Zal asks.\n\"I didn't say all that, but we ARE providing for them in a way. I mean we can start out by digging ourselves out a proper headquarters where we don't have to be constantly bombarded by the smells of the sewer and has a solid defense, but I'm thinking in time we could just build a whole underground town.\"\n\nZalmora and Vaughn look at each other and then you.\n\n\"A TOWN?!\" They exclaim.\n\"Well maybe not town in the traditional sense, but a place where we can do our business AND live without even worrying about the Klyton militia raiding the place because we would be so damn entrenched that they wouldn't be able to do shit even if they wanted to. We wouldn't just be the criminal organization that skulks around in the Klyton sewers, we would be a whole separate community...bah maybe I'm not explaining it well, but I envision it in my head!\" You say.\n\"No. No, I get what you mean. I have to say, this is really damn ambitious. I mean I can't say I'm not impressed by your plan...but again I just have my concerns if it's going to be possible...but fuck it, I'm in.\" Zal says.\n\"Glad to hear it. So, we're going to need miners and equipment which is the easy part, but we're also going to need a genuine engineer so the whole damn thing doesn't fall on our heads. So anyone know of any?\" You remark.\n\"Yeah, Red Nose Rob.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Who's that?\" You ask.\n\"One of the bums that participates in the fights.\"\n\"There's a bum who used to be an engineer? What the hell happened?\"\n\"He was actually a miner, but he had a natural gift when it came to engineering. Which was good for the company since they just used his talents for creating very sound mine supports and they didn't have to pay for a real one. He probably could have been building new structures in Klyton, but he just didn't have the formal education.\"\n\"Interesting. But how do you know so much about him?\" You ask.\n\"He has his lucid moments. Plus, um...we used to...meet up...\"\n\"Ew Vaughn. You fucked a disgusting bum?\" Zalmora remarks.\n\"No! I fucked him when he was strapping miner! Sheesh Zal!\"\n\"Never mind all that, would he be able to do the job?\" You ask\n\"I think so. Probably wouldn't have to pay him much more than we do to fight, but we\u2019d definitely have to dry him out a bit though.\" Vaughn says.\n\nYou start making notes of various ideas as you ask more questions.\n\n\"Okay, so we got one potential overseer for this project. You got any more engineer ex-lovers?\" You ask.\n\"Not that I know of boss.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"I think I got a potential suggestion.\" Zal says.\n\"Oh? You been fucking engineers too?\" You ask.\n\"Even better. Been fucking dwarves. Grahk Kazek is the one that comes to mind.\"\n\"Well that's nice that you're so open minded with your choice of sex partners, but is this dwarf an actual engineer? Contrary to popular belief, I don't think all of them dig big holes in mountains for a living.\"\n\"This one does. Or at least he did before he retired. He makes a monthly trip from the Cloudpeake Mountains to Klyton because he REALLY likes the pastries from Stovo's Bakery. Buys up a bunch then goes back home. That's where we met actually.\"\n\"Didn't know you had ongoing long distance relationship, Zal.\" You say.\n\"Lots you don't know about me, but I wouldn't exactly say Grahk and I are in a relationship, we just had a bit of fun together. In fact I haven't seen him in years. I just know he still goes to that bakery since Stovo has mentioned him a few times when I go in there.\"\n\"So would he be interested?\"\n\"He's a dwarf and used to construct tunnel ways in the Cloudpeake Mountains. Fairly certain if we throw enough money at him, he'll be willing to oversee the construction of what we're doing. Besides, I can be pretty persuasive.\"\n\"Hmm, don't I know it.\" You say.\n\nThe dwarf sounds good, but he sounds like he's going to be really expensive. At lot more than the bum anyway. Of course the bum might be unreliable. You say you'll think about both as you go ask other Talons if they know anybody.\n\nYou don't have much luck though. Your other Talons aren't quite as \"worldly\" as your top lieutenants. There is one who has a lead though.\n\n\"Yeah, I think I might know someone boss. This chick called Madeline. She actually attends Klyton University and she's an engineering student.\" Camid remarks.\n\"A student?\" You ask.\n\"Yeah, but she's really fucking smart. Top of her class or some shit. I don't even understand what she's talking about half the time. Of course I'm just staring at her tits most of the time anyway.\u201d\n\"How the hell do you even know her?\"\n\"Oh, she's a little rich girl that likes slumming. Likes to watch the bum fights and get high on Yellow Devil. The usual. Oh and we fuck sometimes.\"\n\nOf course they do. It would certainly be a strange break in the \"theme\" if they didn't. The drug bit concerns you though.\n\n\"Wait, you say she takes Yellow Devil? How the hell is she not a near drooling idiot yet? I don't need someone melting into a pile of goo in the middle of an important project.\" You say.\n\"Don't worry boss. That wouldn't happen.\" Camid says.\n\"And how do you know?\"\n\"Because...um...I make sure she doesn't actually get Yellow Devil. I mean she does, but it's a VERY small amount. Almost nothing. The rest of it is cut severely with various common shit I get from the apothecary. She feels good for a little while and feels rebellious and she doesn't get really hurt.\"\n\"...You like this girl don't you?\" You ask causing Camid to look away a bit.\n\"(Sigh) It didn't start out that way. First time I saw her, I thought she was so damn pretty that I just wanted a chance to fuck her before she turned into a Yellow Devil mess, so I didn't give her the real shit. But in time...well I dunno shit happened...and I'm probably an idiot...\" Camid says trailing off a bit.\n\"Probably, but fortunately your love sick idiocy has worked in your favor, so do you think she'd help?\"\n\"Oh definitely. She'd feel like she would be a real criminal working for a dangerous organization and all. She'd do it for free too, not like she needs the money.\"\n\"Actually she would be a real criminal if she was helping us in this capacity. Good to know about the price. I'll keep her in mind.\"\n\nWell you got a big decision to make based on your underlings recommendations because unfortunately for you, you haven't been lucky enough to fuck someone with engineering skills.", "action_results": [{"action": "Red Nose Rob", "result": "While you have your concerns about Rob, he seems the most affordable, accessible and most importantly, at your mercy.

I also want you to stress that while he doesn't really have a choice in this matter, he'll be making more money and won't have to be getting punched in the face for living.\" You say.\n\"Got it boss.\" Vaughn remarks and leaves to carry out your orders.\n\nA couple days later Vaughn brings in a man with a lot of messy hair, raggedy clothing, a full beard and mustache and red nose.

What happened to your face? Did Vaughn do that?\"\n\"Um, no sir. I was in a match three days ago and the other guy got in a few good punches.\"\n\"Oh yes, you were doing that bum fight business. Well, you won't have to be doing that anymore. You'll get to use your other natural talent.\"\n\"Yes sir.\" Rob once again replies without emotion.\n\"Sort of thought you'd be a bit happier about this opportunity.\"\n\"Apologies sir, but I'm still having a hard time being completely sober right now. It's been awhile and I feel sort of weird.\"\n\"Hm, okay. I should tell you, I don't actually expect you to go completely off the stuff. I just wanted you sober for today while I speak to you. I also expect you to not drink on the job and generally be a functional human being. Now you're going to have some help in this matter since Vaughn here is going to be personally responsible for you. Making sure you stay focused and such.\"\n\nRob just nods.\n\n\"Okay I'm sensing something more is wrong than you just not being used to being sober.\" You say and then Vaughn breaks into the conversation.\n\"Um, yeah. I think Rob is just a bit nervous being within your presence. You know how you have a reputation and all boss.\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"I don't think I can do the job sir.\" Rob blurts out.\n\"Ha ha ha ha! He's just joking...he...\"\n\"Vaughn, will you shut the hell up? Now Rob, what do you mean you can't do the job exactly?\" You ask.\n\"I mean Vaughn's told me what you want and I just don't think I can do it. I don't have the skill or knowledge.\"\n\"Vaughn told me, you had natural talent and were well respected by the mining company because of it.\"\n\"Yeah, well if that was the case they wouldn't have fired me along with everyone else. Look, I don't want to disobey you sir, but I don't want to pretend I'm something I'm not. I mean you'd be even more pissed if you found out I didn't know what the fuck I''m doing.\"\n\"Heh, well you're right on that one. I actually appreciate the honesty. However, I've never really known Vaughn to step up and speak so favorably of someone. I mean I understand you guys had something once, but Vaughn's not one to stick his neck out and tends to play things safe. I have to believe he must be telling the truth to some degree. I mean you can't be a complete idiot.\"\n\"No, maybe not a complete one, but I'm sure not that smart, otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation...(Sigh) I mean if you were asking me to build simple tunnels and rooms and making sure they don't collapse, then yeah I guess I could do that, but I don't know about building an underground city.\"\n\"Okay. Let's stop right there. The underground city is probably a long damn way off. Don't even think about it. We're going to start simple and get more complex later. Tell you what we're going to do...\"\n\nYou proceed to tell Rob that you're just looking to hollow out an underground area to serve as the Crimson Talon headquarters right now and it doesn't have to be fancy. It just needs to be structurally sound. You tell him by that time, you'll probably have gotten a hold of some other engineers that can help Rob if he doesn't feel up to the more complex task of building that underground city.\n\nRob seems a little more receptive to this and says he'll try to do his best. You say he's free to go and as he leaves you tell Vaughn to stay behind.\n\n\"Vaughn, are you absolutely fucking sure he can do this job?!\" You ask.\n\"Yes! He's just been in the gutter for so long his self esteem is low! I mean once he gets back in action he'll be fine!\" Vaughn exclaims.\n\"For your sake, I hope so. Because I'm not here to hold someone's hand and build up their confidence. That's going to be YOUR job. So you better be giving him pep talks, motivational hugs, or inspirational blow jobs. Whatever it is YOU gotta do, you better be doing it, because I'm going to be keeping a close eye on progress of this project.\"\n\nWith this new order Vaughn is of course totally compliant as usual and takes his leave.\n\nAs you're making further preparations for your ambitious plan, Zalmora of course puts her two copper in.\n\n\"I still don't know why you didn't go with my guy. Relying on Vaughn and his bum miner boyfriend just seems like a bad plan.\" Zalmora says.\n\"Your guy would be very expensive and I'm trying to keep the costs down as much as I can. If it looks like things are going to shit, well then I'll consider your guy again.\"\n\"Okay, but won't you have already wasted time and money with this Rob if he turns out to be a failure?\"\n\"(Sigh) Yes Zal, but it's my fucking call and my fucking risk alright? Stop fucking questioning me every other sentence! Here, that's a list of some of the equipment we're going to need. Take some of the boys and go acquire some.\" You say shoving a piece of paper at Zal who takes it.\n\"...pick axes, lanterns, shovels, ropes, lumber? How the hell are we supposed to steal a shitload of heavy ass lumber?\"\n\"I dunno, just get it. Go raid a wood mill. Pay for it. Rip out support beams from abandon buildings. Seduce a lumber jack. Cut down fucking trees yourself and drag them back here. I don't give a shit HOW you do it, just fucking do it!

My guy would have still been better though.\" Zalmora remarks.\n\"Half an admission of defeat, but probably the best I'm going to ever hear from you.

The rooms that were created still need some more detailed work since they're very basic, but for a guy who started out not being sure if he could do any of this, he's done a good job so far. You guess Vaughn was right, once Rob got going he gained confidence. (Either that or Vaughn was giving a lot of inspirational blow jobs, but you'd rather not dwell on that)\n\n\"Are we going to brick up the dirt walls of these rooms or something similar? Not that I don't appreciate the work that's gone into this, but right now the aesthetics are more underground goblin lair, rather than secret criminal headquarters.\" Zal says.\n\"Yeah, we're doing that, adding doors, adding tiled floors and all that stuff, but that's going to get taken care of later when the basic layout is finished.\" You say.\n\"I thought that was complete?\"\n\"It's almost complete. Rob's finishing up the last rooms which are a lot bigger. One of them is going to be the fighting arena.\"\n\"Arena?\"\n\"Well okay, it isn't going to be the Klyton coliseum, but it'll be a proper fighting area where we can put a ring and have people watching and betting without them accidentally stepping in shit water.\"\n\"Hm, well that would be an improvement. Speaking of which, now that this place is on the verge of being complete are we moving all our operations here?\"\n\"Well I'm thinking the gambling games and the fighting arena will be eventually, but the Yellow Devil lab can stay out in those sewer storage rooms along with the junkies. I'm not having melted junkies mess up the floor when we finally get around to putting proper ones down. Mostly though, it's going to be where we can rest and relax without the smell. See how all the potential sleeping areas were built very far away from the sewer wall that was knocked down for the entrance.\" You say.\n\"Yes, the smell is much better in this place. More earthy, less shitty.\"\n\nAs you and Zal are speaking about the Crimson Talon's future, Vaughn walks up to both of you.\n\n\"Hey guys, I've been looking for you both. Rob just finished what will be the fighting arena location. You should see it!\" Vaughn remarks.\n\"Oh good a big dirt room instead of a small one.\" Zalmora remarks.\n\"Aw come on Zal, he worked really hard on it! He even improved upon the original layout!\" Vaughn exclaims.\n\"Went above and beyond huh? Guess he really is getting sure of himself. Might as well see for ourselves.\" You say.\n\nYou, Vaughn and Zal head to the arena. Along the way you notice that the rough tunnel is sloping downward. Vaughn says that Rob really wanted to impress you since you gave him a chance and in order to do that he needed to expand downward a bit to create the fighting arena.\n\n\"Sheesh, did he have the miners dig all the way to Nichan? How deep is this going?\" Zal remarks.\n\"He said he wanted to make it like an underground version of the Klyton coliseum.\" Vaughn says.\n\"He certainly went off script for this, but if it's as impressive as you said he's trying to make it, I'll certainly be pleased.\" You say.\n\nEventually the tunnel stops sloping and evens out. You walk a little more and already in the dim light you can see the room ahead is going to be bigger than you thought.\n\nYou enter the place and find yourself in a large oval room with several long wooden support beams stretching from the floor to the ceiling. The ceiling is actually a lot higher than you expected. If there were seats and stairs encircling the room, it actually might resemble the Klyton coliseum on a smaller scale.\n\nRob stands on top of a high platform near one of the walls and waves.\n\n\"Hey! So what do you think?\" He shouts and starts climbing down a ladder to meet you.\n\n\"Definitely bigger than I thought it would be. I'm just wondering how the hell did I not notice all the dirt being hauled out and dumped from this endeavor. Apparently I wasn't as observant as I thought I was. Just as well I guess, since this is a nice surprise.\" You remark walking around and looking upward.\n\"Yeah, I was trying to keep this part of the project a bit under wraps to surprise you. Really glad you like it. As I mentioned to Vaughn, this part was my way of saying thank you for dragging me out of the fighting ring and giving my real life meaning again.\" Rob says.\n\"And they say the Crimson Talons are nothing but a menace to society. We gave this man his life back. Hell, we gave several folks their lives back. How many miners work for us now?\" You say with a chuckle.\n\nYou continue looking around as Vaughn gives Rob a bit of praise about his work on the project. Meanwhile Zalmora finds something to analyze.\n\n\"Um, these support beams. I just touched this one and it doesn't feel secure. Is this place even safe?\" Zal asks.\n\"Oh yes, this place is definitely safe. Most of these beams aren't even necessary anymore, but none of them are going to slip out of place anyway. Look!\" Rob and then runs over to a beam and then putting all his weight behind his body, leans hard against it.\n\nYou tense up slightly when you see him do this, but nothing happens.\n\n\"See? Solid!\" Rob says.\n\"Natural talent, boss. All he needed was the confidence boost. I guarantee he'll be able to build that underground city better than any dwarf could or Klyton university egghead with an over priced edu...\" Vaughn starts to say and then suddenly the beam that Rob is leaning against cracks.\n\nBefore he can even get off of it, the beam breaks and he falls to the ground as the rest of the beam falls on him, followed by parts of the ceiling.\n\n\"OH SHIT RUN!\" Zal shouts and makes haste towards the room's exit as the ceiling begins to completely collapse. Vaughn follows suit, leaving Rob who has either been knocked unconscious or killed.\n\nYou are unfortunately at the far end of the room and while you try to make it to the exit, you just aren't fast enough and you're crushed by large clumps of packed dirt and rocks. You actually manage to dig a few inches through the dirt before you suffocate.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Grahk Kazek", "result": "It\u2019s going to be expensive, but if you want this done right, a dwarf would be the way to go with this. Plus Zalmora does tend to have the best suggestions.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get your dwarf.\u201d You say returning to Zalmora with your decision.\n\u201cAbout time you listened to my advice again. You\u2019re going to have to give me a month though.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cShit, did we just miss his last visit?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, he actually should be making his visit here in a few days, but while I am the persuasive sort I\u2019m going to need the time to do it. By then, he should be pliable enough to listen to you. Also, I should warn you in advance, the man is very professional about his work and a perfectionist so when he speaks to you on what he\u2019s going to need, he\u2019s not going to be submissive or even polite about it. He\u2019s going to be very direct and probably less than respectful. I\u2019m warning you in advance so you don\u2019t go killing him because you think he\u2019s challenging your authority or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful. (Sigh) Look, this goes both ways. So you let him know this; I\u2019ll tolerate some of his shit behind closed doors because he\u2019s the expert, but he better not be doing it while I\u2019m in the company of others. Otherwise I\u2019ll have to kill him to set an example and I\u2019ll draw it out too because I\u2019ll be really pissed that I\u2019ll have to hire Vaughn\u2019s drunk bum to finish the job!\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll understand that.\u201d\n\u201cHe better. Well let\u2019s go acquire the miners and equipment in the meantime.\u201d You say dismissing Vaughn and Zalmora.\n\nMonth later\u2026\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be done.\u201d Grahk says as he finishes looking at the layout you made.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cYour layout is shit, your equipment and materials are subpar and I\u2019ve seen the lot you\u2019ve acquired as miners. A bunch of drunks, bums, and other miscreants whose good days are behind them, assuming they ever had them to begin with. You\u2019re going to have constant problems with potential tunnels collapses and that\u2019s the best case scenario.\u201d\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here? To make sure that doesn\u2019t fucking happen?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m used to working with superior dwarf equipment and dwarves who also know what the hell they\u2019re doing. As far as I can tell I\u2019m the only one here that\u2019s competent in this field. You humans literally don\u2019t know your asses from a hole in the ground when it comes to this shit. I\u2019d feel safer working with goblins.\u201d\n\u201cOh well I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize I was going to be in the presence of the king of the little beardy shits! Excuse me your highness!\u201d\n\u201cZal, I thought you told me this guy was reasonable.\u201d Grahk asks Zal in an unruffled voice.\n\u201cHe is, most of the time. Boss, will you just calm down for a moment?\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cCalm down? What the fuck for? He just said this shit couldn\u2019t be done! And I guess that\u2019s it, considering he\u2019s the expert and all!\u201d you yell.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me finish my first sentence, you just interrupted and got everything off track. What I was going to say is it can\u2019t be done by what you\u2019ve got here. It CAN be done if I bring in my people and equipment.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you retired?\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cMe? Nah I just stopped working for Cloudpeake government. I still have a small business on the side that keeps me busy. Can\u2019t just lounge about for days on end.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, so now I\u2019m paying for more of you bearded runts and your high priced equipment. And how the hell are we supposed to sneak in hundreds of you lot into the fucking sewers? Even using the secret outside entrance is running a risk of someone noticing that there are a legion of dwarfs carrying digging equipment being seen marching towards the city. Klyton will probably think it\u2019s a fucking invasion.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFirst of all, there are only twenty dwarves that work for me, but we might as well be a legion compared to a hundred humans. Second of all, I already had it figured out as soon as Zal told me all about your plan.\u201d Grahk says.\n\u201cWell you want to enlighten the rest of us?\u201d\n\u201cGladly.\u201d\n\nGrahk says the Klyton sewers are in terrible condition (Not surprising since they\u2019re human made). He says he knows an old acquaintance on the Klyton Council and all he has to do is approach him about doing some work on the sewers for a low price. The Council will accept because they know dwarves do good work and they\u2019ll be getting a hell of a deal. In reality, Grahk\u2019s crew aren\u2019t going to do much except do some cosmetic patchwork to make it look like they\u2019re doing more than they actually are. (Which is what a human crew would do anyway, Grahk adds)\n\nThis plan of course is a cover for what is really going to go on which is creating your little Crimson Talon hideout.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t they check up on you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWho those fops on the council? Hardly. They aren\u2019t going to give a shit about a bunch of dwarves mucking about in the sewers as long as the job gets done. In fact they\u2019ll probably tell the militia to not even patrol the sewers as much because they\u2019ll know we\u2019re not going to want anyone in the way of our work and we\u2019re bringing in our own security.\u201d Grahk says.\n\u201cYou seem very sure of all this and it\u2019s quite likely that this attempt to trick the Council and bringing them in is going to result in them sniffing around and it will all end in disaster and our heads on the fucking chopping block.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I thought I was dealing with the boss of a criminal organization, not the timid rent boy in the brothel. Why the hell are you hooked up with these losers Zal?\u201d Grahk asks Zalmora.\n\nYou\u2019ve had it with the insults; you unsheathe your flintlock pistol and point it at Grahk who doesn\u2019t show fear.\n\n\u201cWhat, so am I supposed to be scared of you now? I\u2019ve fought trolls in hand to hand combat. I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by the likes of you drawing a pistol on me.\u201d Grahk remarks.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re scared or not, I\u2019m warning YOU, one more insult. One. And you aren\u2019t leaving this room alive.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re both pretty princesses, can we stop with the pissing contest?\u201d Zal says.\n\nGrahk looks over at Zal, looks back at you, and puts up his hands and nods.\n\n\u201cFine. Apologies. Shouldn\u2019t have insulted you in your own home, but it was my understanding that you\u2019re a man that takes risks. I mean you had the vision for this project and your very career choice involves risk. Besides, you\u2019re forgetting that you\u2019re not the only one taking a chance here. You don\u2019t think I won\u2019t suffer consequences if the Klyton Council finds out what I\u2019m really doing? Trust me, I\u2019m going to be making sure things are going very smoothly. All you really have to worry about is coming up with the coins for all this.\u201d Grahk says.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get paid. Don\u2019t worry about that. Just do the job.\u201d You respond putting away the pistol.\n\u201cSo we have an agreement?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd with that deal done, the work begins.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 27\n\nYou have to admit, despite the close calls, the stress of changing the layout, and the several times you almost wanted to kill Grahk, he came through and this place is a lot better than you could have expected, if much smaller.\n\nThis place is less of a \u201cbudding underground town\u201d and more of an underground mini-fortress and really maybe that was a more realistic goal anyway. You have sturdy walls, rooms, and a hidden entrance within the sewer with a couple of durable security doors just in case the militia does the find the place. You also have an escape route dug out far enough that you\u2019d be able to getaway long before they broke in.\n\nBut that\u2019s just your headquarters. There is another secret area where you hold the gambling games, races and fights. Besides it being a better idea to keep the actual activities (and the plebs) away from your main base, Grahk actually said it would be better structural wise to build two separate and smaller hidden locations rather than just one big one which be a lot more costly to maintain and keep from collapsing. So that\u2019s what you did.\n\nStill, you decided to keep one business out of both of the new areas. Namely the Yellow Devil creation and distribution. You aren\u2019t having any junkies going in either to get their fixes and YD stinks something awful that it would defeat the damn purpose of leaving the sewers if you were creating it in these nice new areas.\n\nDue to all the expenses you had to pay for with the dwarves, you had to go back to the old methods of pulling heists and burglary because the drugs, gambling games and fights weren\u2019t enough. Of course that was mostly you, Zal and Vaughn doing those, because you wanted to make sure it was done right.\n\nOn the plus side, it\u2019s kept you in shape and your skills sharp. It also raises your respect among the rest of the Crimson Talons since they know you\u2019re willing to get right in the thick of things and aren\u2019t just delegating.\n\nThe downside is you\u2019re still not exactly rolling in coin and you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had real rest since this project began and you\u2019re always vaguely tired, but then as they say no rest for the wicked.\n\nThe other side effect is you\u2019ve created a minor \u201ccrime wave\u201d throughout Klyton to the point where things are getting out of hand for the militia slightly. Besides the ongoing breaking into shops and homes, your increased production of Yellow Devil has created an epidemic of \u201cmeltbrains\u201d as they are called. Didn\u2019t help that you got the idea from Camid to start cutting the drug to make it less lethal, while still keeping most of it\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d effects for the user.\n\nStill causes a lot of irreversible long-term damage that most aren\u2019t coming back from, which now probably makes it even worse. Junkies are living long enough to cause real problems hence the crime wave.\n\nYou\u2019ve been extremely fortunate that the authorities have mostly been turning the city upside down and making mass arrests to every petty criminal they can get their hands on, but so far they haven\u2019t done much with the sewers. There were a few close calls with some minor patrols, but Grahk\u2019s crew has been pretty good in keeping their real activities (and you) secret. Grahk\u2019s Council buddy must have an incredible amount of trust in him or maybe he\u2019s just corrupt. You have no idea, you\u2019ve never met him.\n\nStill, Klyton\u2019s uncharacteristic lackadaisical alertness on this matter is going to be coming to an end. Grahk is done with the task and will be leaving soon, which means Klyton will probably be stepping up their patrols down here. Not even the rumors of a killer reptile man is going to scare them away. (You question if this Scales is even down here, surely you would have run afoul of him, with all this work the dwarves have been doing)\n\nBut the only concern you have right at this moment is the information you\u2019ve just heard.\n\n\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re leaving?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cFigured I should let you know. Despite our differences at times, I respect you enough to not just disappear.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cHold on you\u2019re going to have to re-explain this again. This is just out of nowhere.\u201d You say and take a seat.\n\u201cIt really isn\u2019t. Grahk and I have been seeing each other for quite some time since he got here for this project.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen you two speaking with one another every so often. Sometimes it looked a little more than that, but I didn\u2019t take you for the running off and getting married sort!\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? Grahk made a very good offer.\u201d\n\u201cGiven what comes out of his mouth half the time, he doesn\u2019t even like humans.\u201d\n\u201cWell he likes me and I\u2019m very fond of him. Also, I\u2019ve realized that this life\u2026well it isn\u2019t the one I want any more.\u201d Zal says waving her arms in the air and making motions about her surroundings.\n\u201cSo\u2026what? You\u2019re going to go pop out a bunch of bearded babies and be a nice little housewife in some dark underground cavern?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already practically living in an underground cavern now! And dwarves and humans can\u2019t reproduce with each other\u2026well as far as I know. Besides, he\u2019s already got a couple of children from his deceased wife, so that isn\u2019t going to be an issue anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBut what are you going to DO with yourself? I mean I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to go back to the Cloudpeake Mountains. Dwarves aren\u2019t known for being all that accepting of outsiders at the best of times. You\u2019re not likely to have any friends.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well it isn\u2019t like I really have any here either.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little taken aback.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026? What? What about me and Vaughn? What about all the Talons that respect your abilities?\u201d you say.\n\u201cThose are subordinates, not my friends. You\u2019re my boss, not my friend. And as for Vaughn\u2026well okay, you\u2019re right about him, but he\u2019s hardly enough to keep me around here waiting for the inevitable.\u201d Zalmora responds.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThis whole place is going to raided and all of you are either going to get pinched or killed. Best case scenario, you escape with nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s some severe lack of confidence in your soon to be dwarf husband\u2019s abilities. Besides, you were originally enthusiastic about this whole project and the potential.\u201d\n\u201cI know I was at first, but the original goal has changed now hasn\u2019t it? Look, maybe everything won\u2019t be all doom and gloom and maybe everything does go smoothly, but the fact that I realize is that I\u2019m getting old and I\u2019m enjoying this type of life less and less. I soon learned that on the last heist we did and I nearly got my head blown off by the militia.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hardly old Zal, I mean you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re ready for the grave.\u201d\n\u201cIf I keep on this way, I soon will be. Look, I\u2019ve been giving this a lot of thought for quite some time.\u201d\n\u201cSo again, I ask what are you going to do with your time? I mean I really can\u2019t envision you as some housewife. You\u2019re going to get bored and dissatisfied.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do YOU know that? Maybe I\u2019ll find it a great relief not worrying about which shop to rob or whether or not if I\u2019m going to get arrested or killed. And who says I\u2019m not going to find something to do while I\u2019m up there? Grahk owns his own business you know. I\u2019m sure I can help with that in some way.\u201d\n\nA moment of silence comes over you and you cease looking at Zalmora. You can\u2019t believe you might be losing your best \u201cemployee.\u201d\n\nIt would appear you took it for granted that she\u2019d always be around. Though you did always consider the possibility that she might die in the service of the Crimson Talons just like anyone, but something about this is much different and you don\u2019t like this form of parting of the ways. At least not without trying to do something about it.\n\n\u201cWhat would it take for you to stay?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing. I told you, I\u2019ve made up my mind about this.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cBullshit. You wouldn\u2019t have told me at all, if you didn\u2019t want me to make the attempt to at least come up with an offer.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t know where you got that idea from, but I already told you that I came to you about this because I respected you enough to not sneak off in the middle of the night.\u201d Zalmora sputters.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not buying it. I don\u2019t buy that you\u2019re ready to settle down and live a boring ordinary life. I mean I\u2019ve SEEN you get the thrill even during that last heist where you almost got your head blown off. I mean maybe the safe life does have its advantages, and if you were marrying a Delantium prince who was going to shower you with jewels and a royal palace I\u2019d say congrats and just let you go without a fight. Hell, if you said that you LOVED this dwarf I wouldn\u2019t stand in the way, but you didn\u2019t say that. You just claimed fondness. You\u2019re not moving up, you\u2019re just trading one life of compromise for another.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be very interested in my well being\u2026are you actually jealous? Is this some crush you\u2019ve been harboring because if it is, I\u2019m going to tell you right now that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s nothing like that. While you don\u2019t consider me your friend, I consider you mine, because quite frankly I don\u2019t have any either and it\u2019s hard enough to have someone trustworthy and reliable in this business as it is. You were the one who gave me all the most important advice that resulted in rebuilding the Crimson Talons to be a viable organization again. And yeah, maybe I didn\u2019t listen to all of it, but I do acknowledge that I wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far without you and I can\u2019t see me getting too much further without you by my side either. I need you.\u201d\n\nNow Zalmora is speechless and looks away. You stare at her, but she makes sure to not look in your direction. You know she must be trying to hide obvious signs of being upset.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026yes\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d Zal says and then turns around and quickly wipes one of her eyes.\n\nZalmora composes herself a bit and then speaks.\n\n\u201cVery well. I do have one request if I\u2019m going to consider staying. We have to stop selling Yellow Devil.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWhat? But that\u2019s what kept us afloat! If we hadn\u2019t been selling it, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford the new headquarters!\u201d you reply.\n\u201cYes, and now that project is over with. We can get by without dealing it. Yellow Devil is going to cause us nothing but trouble in the future. I\u2019m already seeing that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll admit, its got its share of problems, but it\u2019s the biggest money maker and a lot of the Talons aren\u2019t going to be happy about no longer selling it. Specifically Camid.\u201d\n\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t a negotiation. This is my stipulation. I\u2019ll leave you to deal with the repercussions as you see fit. Grahk is leaving in a week. You\u2019ve got three days to tell me your decision, because if you value my friendship as much as you claim and you do decide to stop selling, then I\u2019m going to need the rest of the week to deal with Grahk before he leaves, because I\u2019ll be breaking not just his heart but an agreement and you know how serious dwarves are about those.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Stop selling Yellow Devil", "result": "This might not be the best of business decisions, but if this is what it\u2019s going to take then so be it. There will always be other opportunities, but reliable folks you can count on, not so much.\n\n\u201cAlright, fine. You don\u2019t need to wait three days. I\u2019ll take care of it now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAre you sure? Because don\u2019t just make a rash decision in some misguided effort to play white knight. This is your organization, run it how you see fit, I don\u2019t need saving.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I\u2019m not playing white knight. If anything I\u2019m playing black guard by stealing the princess away from her husband to be if we\u2019re going to use that comparison. You said to stop selling Yellow Devil is what will keep you around, well I\u2019m willing to make the sacrifice because that\u2019s just how much I value your presence here.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026I\u2019m a princess eh?\u201d Zal says with a smirk.\n\u201cYes, so go break the squat prince\u2019s heart already so we can get back to business.\u201d\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s still not going to be easy. I do have feelings for Grahk and he feels strongly for me!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t love him. You still haven\u2019t said that you did and I wouldn\u2019t believe it at this point anyway, because if you did you wouldn\u2019t be willing to drop him like this. You were seeking an easy way out of this life, but this wasn\u2019t the way and you would have regretted it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026I guess we\u2019ll never know now. (Sigh) You\u2019re right though, I didn\u2019t really love him I suppose. Still going to be difficult.\u201d\n\u201cPfft. You want difficult, I\u2019m going to have to convince everyone to be happy that we\u2019re out of the drug trade now and taking a loss.\u201d\n\u201cWe all have our burdens to bear. Good luck with yours.\u201d Zalmora says and starts to leave, but then walks back over to hug you.\n\nYou weren\u2019t expecting it, but you return the hug.\n\n\u201cThank you for your words.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cOkay, okay, I think we\u2019ve done enough bonding and getting our feelings out for today.\u201d You say not wishing to get too emotional.\n\nZal kisses you on the cheek and leaves.\n\nNow you have to just go find Vaughn and discuss what changes are to come and who is going to be the most troublesome over it. Camid is the obvious one, but probably his closest \u201ccircle\u201d as well.\n\nLater\u2026\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got this impenetrable hidden headquarters now! Let the militia fumble around here in the sewers looking for us! Even if they do, they aren\u2019t going to get in without severe losses!\u201d Camid exclaims.\n\u201cAnd they can take a lot more losses than we can too and if they do get determined enough they WILL get in here. Things are too hot up top right now and we need for them to cool down a bit. Hence why we need to stop selling Yellow Devil. It\u2019s causing too many problems. We still got the rest, and we can possibly look into other opportunities or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis is fucking bullshit!\u201d Camid exclaims which is echoed by a few others.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t up for debate.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut we are making coin hand over fist! If anything we should be abandoning everything else and just focusing on selling Yellow Devil! In fact I got an idea for a new drug! It\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it! I made my decision and it\u2019s fucking final! What don\u2019t you understand?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re being stupid about this! Wasn\u2019t the whole point of building this headquarters was to help usher in some new era of the Crimson Talons? Seems like you had us waste a shitload of coin that could have been better spent doing other things.\u201d\n\u201cLike what for example? You got any ideas Camid? What would have you liked to do instead? You want to run this organization?\u201d\n\nCamid doesn\u2019t say it out loud, but he mutters something.\n\n\u201cWhat? What was that?!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cI said no.\u201d Camid says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t want to make Zalmora cry when I it took from her.\u201d Camid says which causes laughter by his fellows.\n\nYou\u2019re silent for a moment as Camid stares at you defiantly. He\u2019s doubled down on challenging you and already he\u2019s pulling out his sword. You could just shoot him or even tell your loyal Talons to kill him since a lot of them are close enough, but you know that isn\u2019t going to solve the problem, if anything it\u2019s going to make it worse. You\u2019re going to have to beat him in a fair fight.\n\nYou draw your own weapon and face Camid in combat. It isn\u2019t much of a contest though. While Camid has some above average fighting skills, he hasn\u2019t been keeping them sharp like you\u2019ve been doing. That sort of happens when you have to fight off private night security and dodge militia bullets and arrows on a regular basis.\n\nIt takes all of two minutes before you\u2019ve given Camid a cut on his face, severed part of his sword hand and got your boot on his chest.\n\n\u201cStop! I yield! I surrender! I surrender! You\u2019re the boss!\u201d Camid shouts holding up his good arm begging you for mercy.\n\u201cDamn right.\u201d You reply.\n\nThen you pull out your flintlock and shoot him in the head.\n\n\u201cTake every fool that was laughing at this asshole\u2019s joke about Zal really running things around here and kill them. Think of this as a pay increase for the rest of you.\u201d You say.\n\nYour loyalists don\u2019t need anymore prodding than that and waste no time in grabbing Camid\u2019s cohorts and dragging them off. You turn to Vaughn and tell him to go oversee the rest of this mess and make sure your orders are carried out and how you want all the Yellow Devil labs destroyed and if any junkies come sniffing around kill them too.\n\nFive days later\u2026\n\nZalmora steps into your office.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re here. Wasn\u2019t expecting you back until tomorrow.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI had to make sure Grahk left with no hard feelings. It would have been very easy for him to cause trouble for us, but\u2026well you know me.\u201d Zalmora replies.\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re very convincing. Guess he really took it hard huh?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know. Actually I was a little surprised myself, but I think in a way it helped him confirm that humans are the scum of the world though. Makes him a little less contradictory.\u201d\n\u201cAlways nice to have your world views reinforced.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think he\u2019s ever coming back here though. Not even for Stovo\u2019s pastries.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m sure there are other Halfling bakers to buy from. It\u2019s big world out there.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of buying and selling. How did Camid take it about the Yellow Devil distribution?\u201d\n\u201cHe took it in the head and the rest of the ones that agreed with him are also no longer with us. It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I see. Well, I guess everything is settled.\u201d\n\u201cFor now at least. Glad to have you back Zal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be back too.\u201d\n\nThe pair of you smile at each other and get back to Crimson Talon business. With the new changes and Zalmora still at your side, you\u2019re fairly confident that the future will at least be productive.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 3A2: Better Red than Dead\n\n\n\nYear 30\n\n\u201cWe should expand.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCan we do that?\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not a bad idea. Now that shit here has calmed down to a manageable level in Klyton, we could probably spare a few people to open a new Crimson Talon chapter elsewhere. The problem is we don\u2019t have many viable choices.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about, there\u2019s Hessla, Holgard, the entire fucking Delantium Kingdom for starters.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThe Delantium Kingdom is Ebony Claw Syndicate territory, have you forgotten?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but the kingdom is a big fucking place. Surely they can\u2019t control all of the damn underworld there.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not, but I doubt if potentially stepping on their toes is a great idea for us. Same situation in Holgard. They got a chapter there as well.\u201d\n\u201cHasn\u2019t that place undergone a couple of rebellions?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cYeah, but as far as I know the Ebony Claw still has a presence.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cAlright, alright, I get it. We\u2019re not big enough to fuck with the ECS. (Sigh) I know our limitations unfortunately. Okay, so what about Hessla? The Claw doesn\u2019t have a presence there.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cSure, but the Headsmen control that place for Governor Tolen. I\u2019m not sure if you know much about Hessla other than the typical misconceptions. But the place is just as orderly as Klyton. In some aspects maybe even more so. Yeah, it\u2019s a haven for pirates and such, but as a general rule the major crimes take place outside the town. The Headsmen catch you stealing there for example and they chop off both your hands at best.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cWell there\u2019s always risk. I mean we risk the militia here.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but Hessla also has the same problem Klyton does, namely everything is legal except again even more so. I\u2019m not exactly sure what we could do there, in the scheme of things given that most of our profit comes from illegal gambling and stealing shit.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go back to selling Yellow Devil. I mean we wouldn\u2019t be selling it here. Just in Hessla.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\nZal just stares at Vaughn with mild disapproval.\n\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just contributing here!\u201d Vaughn.\n\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced that the drug trade is the way to go, but I\u2019ll admit it isn\u2019t the worst idea. It wouldn\u2019t be shitting where we eat at least. However, Governor Tolen would probably take a cut of anything we make just for operating there.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cSounds like if this Tolen asshole wasn\u2019t around we\u2019d be able actually do something in that town.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just kill him like we had Jake killed? I mean that guy you hired seemed pretty damn effective.\u201d Vaughn suddenly says which causes a bit of surprise from you and Zal.\n\nVaughn doesn\u2019t often contribute this many serious ideas in these sessions, let alone the really aggressive ones. You can only imagine the Crimson Talon success (and relative safer location) has encouraged him a little bit assertive.\n\n\u201cNot only would I have to deal with that creepy fuck, Mr. Reynolds again, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want me to pay out the ass or some other price that will have a catch.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, if we are going to expand in Hessla, getting rid of Tolen would solve some major issues. Hessla is sort of a delicate system. Cut off the head and it\u2019s going to descend into anarchy\u2026at least for a while. I assume his second in command, but I dunno who that might be. Wouldn\u2019t be too hard to find out with some investigation. Tell you what. Before we do anything, why don\u2019t I go to Hessla and check out what the situation is like there first?\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt I suppose. You gonna be okay going there by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Better if I just go alone. I know how to blend in better and it\u2019s been a long time since I was in Hessla. Wouldn\u2019t mind updating my knowledge first hand anyway. Might take me about a month to gather what I need to know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but just remember you\u2019re not there to sight see.\u201d\n\nThe three of you agree to this plan and while Zal goes off on her mission, you and Vaughn return to your usual tasks.\n\nA little more than a month passes and just as you start to get a little concerned Zal returns. You actually give her a hug when you see her.\n\n\u201cYou thought I wasn\u2019t coming back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad to see you is all! Can\u2019t one friend hug another? Look, so what did you learn?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cMore than I expected to.\u201d\n\nZal goes into the situation at Hessla which as she predicted was indeed a delicate one. Governor Tolen does rule the town with an iron fist, but it\u2019s barely a secret that his second in command Captain Illam would actually be worse. It\u2019s just a good thing for the town that he\u2019s at sea most of the time and isn\u2019t in charge.\n\nThe third person down the chain is a little more hopeful. Zal said she actually managed to speak with a Captain Yan who apparently was wooed by Zal\u2019s charms when she tried to recruit her as part of her crew.\n\nAfter spending a few interesting nights with her, Captain Yan blabbed just about everything. Yan made it pretty clear that she would like Tolen out of the picture entirely and his shake down of anyone that comes through or docks there. She says that he\u2019s basically getting rich just sitting on his ass, while all the hard working sailors are paying him for safe harbor.\n\nCaptain Yan said if she could she\u2019d make Hessla freer than it claims to be, but she doesn\u2019t have the support to attempt a coup of any sort, plus she wouldn\u2019t really want to be in charge of a town. Her love of the sea is too great to be stuck in some town.\n\nZal didn\u2019t bring it up that she belonged to the Crimson Talons, but she got the very real distinction that if the Talons came in to help Yan, she\u2019d go through with her plan. Yan certainly has the inside knowledge of the Governor\u2019s mansion and such. Plus Yan now seems to have a bit of a crush on Zal.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is it with you?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cHey, I just know how to lay it down like that.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cWell this is all certainly useful information. If what you\u2019re saying is true. We could get rid of this Tolen AND possibly have free reign of the town if this Yan isn\u2019t actually going to stick around to govern. What about this Illam guy though?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. I mean I assume we kill him too. Yan\u2019s not an admirer of him either.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of fucking people to kill. I mean this isn\u2019t a simple assassination. We\u2019re talking a full-scale assault and we can\u2019t expect to not take losses ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cWell nobody said it was going to be easy.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026but I think we\u2019re going to need help after all.\u201d You say with a heavy sigh.\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re going to go to Mr. Reynolds?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t necessarily want to, but if I think it would help to have a highly skilled bloodthirsty assassin on our side, I\u2019m not going to just dismiss the possibility.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you boss man.\u201d\n\nYou figure at the very least you can pay him a visit. If you don\u2019t like what he says, you can always leave. You\u2019d rather have the extra help if possible.\n\nZal and Vaughn defer to your decision and the next day you walk into Mr. Reynolds' office.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you see a strange ogrish looking creature, but much shorter than one. In fact if it wasn't for the oversized teeth and general monstrous appearance, you might mistake it for a very muscular dwarf.\n\nYou also see Henry, or at least you assume it's Henry. He hasn't changed much since the last time you saw him, though he's sporting a few scars across his face now.\n\nFinally you see Mr. Reynolds and he certainly hasn't changed. Once again he stands up smiling at his desk.\n\n\"Well what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit from the head of the infamous Crimson Talons this fine day?\" Mr. Reynolds says.\n\"I might need some people killed.\" You say.\n\"Hm, straight to business I see. Okay then, I assume there is some reason why you aren't having your own people taking care of this?\"\n\"Let's just say, I think we might need some help on this one.\"\n\"Hm, Sounds serious, you planning on taking out the Klyton Council?\u201d he chortles.\n\u201cNo, just the Governor of Hessla\u2026well and his second in command.\u201d\n\nAs you go into a little more you manage to get a genuine look of interest on Mr. Reynolds face.\n\n\u201cAmbitious. Though I\u2019m not sure I can help. You see I mostly deal in matters concerning Klyton. Although\u2026well I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d be interested in that\u2026\u201d\n\nYou haven't been here five minutes, and he's already playing mind games...\n\n\"Just fucking spit it...\" You start to shout, but then you stop and then calm yourself before continuing.\n\n\"Mr. Reynolds, with all due respect, I have come here asking for assistance on this matter as I once did in the past. Your son did a marvelous job last time even if... I didn't quite appreciate its thoroughness last time. I am willing to pay your costs if they appear to be reasonable.\" You say.\n\nMr. Reynolds listens intently and smiles.\n\n\"I'm glad to see that wisdom has come with your age. That's good. Last time our business together was less than cordial. That's okay though, I still got paid. As I said, I would love to help you again in this matter, but I'm afraid due to this being an outside job as it were, the cost is going to be quite high. Not just because of that however, but also because my son Henry takes things a bit more personal than I do. Though I\u2019m sure I can convince him for the right price.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cOkay, but what is the price? How much?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh no, there won\u2019t be any money for this\u2026well okay one thousand gold coins should do it on that front.\u201d\n\u201cA thousand? Is that all?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Of course not. You have to leave Klyton.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cWell you and all your little Talon buddies. Basically I want YOU out of this city and set up shop in Hessla which should be wide open after I help you.\u201d\n\u201cThis is ridiculous! My goal is expansion not relocation! Why the hell should I move and why do you want me to anyway?\u201d\n\u201cMy reasons are my own, but that\u2019s my price. Besides, I\u2019m also going to throw in that fine gentleman over there to help.\u201d\n\nMr. Reynolds points over to the ogre looking creature.\n\n\"And who is that?\" You ask.\n\"Who is that? Don't you see the family resemblance? This fine gentleman is the late great Olaf's son!\" Mr. Reynolds exclaims.\n\"The late Olaf?\"\n\"Yes, it was a sad day when Olaf passed a few years ago. Died right here in the office in his sleep in fact. He will be missed. But anyway his son Olaf Jr. has been following in his father's large footsteps and I don't mind saying he's been doing a fine job for me and his own mother is very proud of him.\"\n\nYou remember that Mr. Reynolds once said Olaf was married to a halfling. You can't imagine how that birth was even possible let alone how she survived the process. It does however explain Junior's strange appearance by ogre standards. (Or any standards actually)\n\nMr. Reynolds goes on to assure you that he has more than enough skill to help do the job you require especially since the ogre is unlike his father and has embraced technology. He particularly has a great love of weapons that do damage on a massive scale.\n\n\u201cReally, with both Henry AND Junior working with you, you probably won\u2019t suffer any losses at all. Just think, you\u2019ll have an entire town at your mercy. Really, what are you losing by leaving Klyton? Despite all your precautions, you still live hiding in the shadows and eking out a lesser existence than you could be. The milita and the Council will always be a problem for you, but at Hessla? YOU could be the law. You\u2019re a natural leader obviously. In the right environment you could truly thrive to your full potential.\u201d\n\nFlattering words to get you to do what he wants no doubt, but he isn\u2019t entirely wrong.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the help", "result": "\u201cAlright fine, but this is a big thing. We\u2019re replacing an entire regime. Your people better be all in on wiping out every fucker that stands against us.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh of that you can be assured.\u201d Mr. Reynolds remarks.\n\u201cGood, because if I think they\u2019re doing anything less than that, I\u2019m going to be less inclined to just pick up and leave here. Also, I need to run this by one of my people so she can go inform the other people that are against Tolen. It would at least help if we had a little coordination in this endeavor.\u201d\n\u201cSure, sure. Just return with the payment and let me know when you\u2019re ready. Don\u2019t take too long though; I do need these fine gentlemen for other jobs. Look forward to working with you again.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t say you feel the same, but you feel a little more confident in your chances with Mr. Reynolds\u2019 psycho son and his pet ogre half-breed. Now you just have to run this over with Zalmora and try to coordinate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving Klyton?!\u201d Zalmora exclaims.\n\u201cGee boss that seems a bit extreme.\u201d Vaughn adds.\n\u201cYeah well that\u2019s the decision. We\u2019re going all in on this because if we pull it off, we\u2019ve got an entire town to play around with rather than what we got here. Building an underground complex was a good attempt, but I realize now that in order to be a proper force in this world, we need to be unrestrained. Anyway, this isn\u2019t up for debate and we\u2019re doing this in a week so Zal, you need to get going back to Hessla and tell all your little pirate friends to get prepared.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cA week? We might need longer than that to properly plan!\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve got seven days. Should be more than enough time and whether they\u2019re ready or not, we\u2019re hitting Hessla and hitting it hard. If they aren\u2019t going to be with us, they can stay the fuck out of the way.\u201d\n\nZal and Vaughn are both a bit flabbergasted at your rather extreme approach to all this. You know Zal wants to argue and Vaughn probably even wants to say something, but they can both see how you\u2019re not going to budge on this so they just comply.\n\n\u201cOkay, fine. Whether I convince them or not I\u2019ll meet you a few miles away from Hessla near the copse of trees off the side of the road. You\u2019ll know it when you see it. And I also just want to say I still think this is a bad idea.\u201d Zal says before leaving.\n\nWell you knew she\u2019d get in the last word.\n\nYou have Vaughn use up some of the treasury to acquire some more gunpowder weapons (and traditional ones as well), meanwhile you take your payment to Mr. Reynolds who tells you that his people will meet you at Hessla as they prefer to travel by themselves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll be ready by the time you arrive at Hessla.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\nYou return to your headquarters and inform Vaughn to gather everyone tonight because you\u2019re making your way to Hessla tomorrow.\n\nLater that night when you have all the Talons in your presence, you give a last minute speech about how this is a positive move and it will only be beneficial for the organization in the long run. While most members had already been informed about this new development the same day you accepted Mr. Reynolds\u2019 help, most of them are still processing it and naturally some are still unsure of the whole leaving Klyton thing.\n\n\u201cDo you mean we really can\u2019t return here ever? Like not even to visit?\u201d someone asks.\n\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t going to be able to take everything from here in one day and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to anyway given that we\u2019re going into a full scale battle. So what we\u2019re probably going to do when we\u2019ve settled everything in Hessla, is come back over the course of maybe a week and move all our remaining shit out of here through the escape tunnel. That\u2019s it though.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cBut, I mean me mum lives here and she needs me to take care of her.\u201d Someone else says.\n\u201cYeah, and I got a wife and kid!\u201d shouts another.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Hessla, I\u2019ve been to there once and all their whores got that weird sea smell. Feels like I\u2019m fucking a mermaid or some shit.\u201d replies another.\n\u201cThis seems like a bad idea boss, I mean I don\u2019t want to step out of line, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cENOUGH! This is what the fucking plan is and it\u2019s not up for fucking debate! You got tonight to settle your shit, make arrangements and take whatever you need because tomorrow we\u2019re leaving. If you don\u2019t fucking like it, then you can get the fuck out right now! We can get along without you AND if I see any of you deserters in Hessla in the future, you\u2019re fucking dead!\u201d you shout.\n\nThere isn\u2019t too much more grumbling or debating after that.\n\nAs for you, you don\u2019t have much to take. About the only thing you wish you could take is all this shit that you had built. Seems like it was all a damn waste of money now, but what\u2019s done it done.\n\nAfter packing what you need, you get some rest because it\u2019s going to be the start of an eventful week tomorrow.\n\nThe next day, you take a head count of who is around and see that some of them decided to abandon you which isn\u2019t surprising considering you really expected some of them would. You just hope Zal comes through with her pirate friends and Reynolds\u2019 psychos for hire are at the top of their game.\n\nYou all start to exit through the escape tunnel fully armed and prepared. You almost feel like a military general leading an army.\n\nYou just wish you inspired more loyalty and not just because some of your members deserted you, but because as soon as you exit the escape tunnel there\u2019s a contingent of Klyton militia waiting for you.\n\nLooks like one of the deserters wasn\u2019t taking any chances on you possibly having him killed so he snitched on you.\n\nMusket fire rings out and you and several of your people are shot. You take a hit to the upper part of your leg and you fall the ground shouting in agony. Not far from your body is Vaughn who was lucky enough to get killed immediately with a shot to his head.\n\nThe Crimson Talons who weren\u2019t killed or otherwise incapacitated desperately attempt to escape either through the wilderness or back through the tunnel. Hardly matters though since the militia is in full force and everywhere.\n\nYou\u2019re not getting taken in alive though. Even if they bother to heal your leg, you know you\u2019re going to just get thrown in one of those hanging cages outside of Klyton at best. At worst they\u2019re just going to publicly execute you anyway.\n\nYou manage to get off a couple shots with your flintlocks, and even manage to stab one the militiamen in the leg from your prone position, but eventually you catch another musket ball in the chest and soon one of the militia finishes you off with a spear to your throat.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go it alone", "result": "Whatever Reynolds reasons are you aren\u2019t going to just abandon everything you built here.\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so.

Good luck on your little endeavors.\u201d Mr. Reynolds replies with a little nod before going back to his work.\n\nYou return to Zal and Vaughn and tell them you\u2019ll be doing this on your own. Zal seems to be a lot more pleased with this idea.\n\nZal tells you it would be best if you all met with Captain Yan so you can coordinate this coup. In the meantime, she says she\u2019ll return to see Yan and hammer out when to meet so Yan doesn\u2019t just suddenly go sailing off to sea.\n\nAnother couple weeks pass before you hear from Zal again and now she\u2019s telling a new tune\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean it\u2019s off?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there have been some changes and Yan isn\u2019t sure if\u2026\u201d Zal starts to say.\n\u201cOh fuck this is just perfect.

Shouldn\u2019t she be jumping at the chance to slaughter her enemies?\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe waited too long.\u201d Vaughn says.\n\u201cTo hell with it, we can do this ourselves. Me, you, and you. We\u2019re going to sneak into the Governor\u2019s mansion or whatever the fuck he lives in and we\u2019ll assassinate him.\u201d You say and start getting ready by putting various objects into a pack.\n\n\u201cWait! I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea! The Governor has protection up the ass! We need Yan\u2019s support if we\u2019re going to do anything! Seriously I can fix this!\u201d Zalmora says trying to calm you.\n\u201cHow Zal? What are you going to do? More of your persuasive talking skills? Lick this Yan bitch into submission? Fuck this, we need to act. I\u2019m not going to be limited to just THIS little shitty piece of Klyton because some are too fucking afraid to grab their destiny!\u201d\n\u201cWill you listen to yourself? What\u2019s all this about destiny? Did Reynolds get into your head or something? Going in half cocked is not the way and you KNOW this! Listen. I can fix this. I\u2019m confident that I can get Yan to see it my way again. She\u2019s just so used to the status quo she\u2019s afraid to take that next step even if she wants to. She just needs a little push. Remember, sort of like the one I gave you years ago? That turned out alright it would seem.\u201d\n\nYou stare at Zal in silence for a moment and then stop hastily putting shit into a pack. You inhale and exhale to gain your composure.\n\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m calm. Very well Zal, you usually know best. I\u2019ll give you another chance to convince this wishy washy bitch, but if you don\u2019t succeed, we\u2019re going through with my plan.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI understand, but just don\u2019t do anything until I come back with news. At the very least I can try to find a better way to assassinate Governor Tolen than just storming in his home and hoping we don\u2019t get killed in the process.\u201d\n\nYou nod and dismiss Zal, confident that she\u2019ll come through for you.\n\nA couple weeks pass and there isn\u2019t any word. Vaughn begins to wonder if she didn\u2019t get killed, like maybe Yan double-crossed her or something. You think though if something like that happened you would have gotten a warning of some sort. Like Zal\u2019s head sent to you as a threat to not enter Hessla again.\n\nYou decide to give it a little more time and if she doesn\u2019t return soon, then you\u2019ll go to Hessla yourself. Turns out the trip won\u2019t be necessary and you\u2019re hit with another unexpected bit of news. This time via messenger who approached Vaughn when he was going about business topside.\n\n\u201cI dunno, the guy said it was from Zal. She told him to find me and give me the letter. Not sure how he knew where to find me though.\u201d Vaughn says giving you a scroll.\n\u201cProbably because Zal knows you\u2019ve been taking your rent boys to the same location to fuck them for years and told him exactly where you\u2019d be. Plus she knows better than to give away the location to our headquarters to some stranger and knows I barely ever leave this place. (Sigh) Well let\u2019s see what this says\u2026why do I feel it isn\u2019t going to be good news?\u201d you say opening the scroll.\n\nYour thoughts aren\u2019t wrong, but you never expected\u2026this\u2026\n\nFirst off, I just want you and Vaughn to know that I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m better than okay actually. The pair of you have both been good friends in this unglamorous life we\u2019ve chosen. I know we\u2019ve had our differences in the past, but ultimately we\u2019ve always been there for each other. I suppose that\u2019s why I stayed with the Talons as long as I did. I didn\u2019t have much, but I knew I at least had you guys.\n\nAnd this is what makes this all the harder.\n\nI have to leave.\n\nI\u2019m going to leave with Yan. She\u2019s been in a similar situation here in Hessla, though in her case Governor Tolen is an outright asshole so it\u2019s an easy decision for her to just hoist the sails and leave Hessla and never return. We\u2019ve found a lot in common with one another and we enjoy each other\u2019s company. I mean I dunno if this is love or what, but I feel I need to at least take this chance. I need to move on with my life. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get talked out of it again like I did with Grahk, though I still think you were right in that case.\n\nBut this is different. I can\u2019t explain it, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d understand really. Right now I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already pissed. You\u2019re probably already planning to come in full force to Hessla and raise fucking hell. Please don\u2019t though, I\u2019m already gone.\n\nJust take care of yourselves okay? And if you ever see an opportunity that can take you to a better life. Take it and don\u2019t look back.\n\nGoodbye, and I love you both.\n\nZalmora\n\nYou trail off a bit as you finish reading the message out loud. You\u2019re a bit dumbstruck. Vaughn is in the same boat.\n\nEventually you just neatly roll the scroll back up and put the ribbon back on it, then you gently place it in your desk drawer and sit back down. You then start going over your profit gains for this year.\n\n\u201cBoss?\u201d Vaughn says.\n\u201cVaughn, you\u2019ll be handling the shit that Zal was in charge of, if you need extra help I trust you\u2019ll be able to promote the appropriate folks.\u201d You respond calmly.\n\u201cBut\u2026what are we going to do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do? Zal took off on a fucking ship to parts unknown. I don\u2019t exactly have a magical crystal ball to see where she went, and I wouldn\u2019t bother anyway. She obviously wasn\u2019t happy here, so it\u2019s better off that she\u2019s gone. Don\u2019t need her anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBoss\u2026now you don\u2019t mean that. Look, I don\u2019t wanna step outta line here and I know you didn\u2019t want to show it for some reason, but I know you had stronger feelings for her than just being friends with her. I mean aren\u2019t you pissed at this betrayal?! Aren\u2019t you upset? Don\u2019t you wanna go kill this Yan bitch for stealing away Zal? I mean I never saw this coming! Did you?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026at least not like this. But what\u2019s done is done and that\u2019s a funny notion you have about my feelings towards Zal there Vaughn. I\u2019m fine. Best to just move on.\u201d\n\u201cWell what about Hessla? Are we still going through with the plan?\u201d\n\u201cOh that. No. Obviously we don\u2019t have the support now and Zal was probably right that we\u2019d only just get ourselves killed if we tried ourselves. No, we\u2019ll just seek further opportunities here in Klyton when they arise.\u201d\n\nVaughn can\u2019t believe how you\u2019re taking all this. Eventually he leaves you be and goes off to perform his duties.\n\nWhen he leaves you lock the door and read the scroll again.\n\nYou sigh heavily and you wipe a few tears come from your eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Zal. Not mad. I get it. Good luck.\u201d You say.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 34\n\n\u201cShit, that\u2019s the fifth patrol down here this week!\u201d you say.\n\u201cI know, the militia has actually managed to round up a few of our guys too recently. Really hoping nobody is going to snitch us out at this point.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\nWhile your members are generally pretty loyal, it\u2019s always a bit of a concern and you\u2019re not exactly filled with confidence. The last few years have just been getting worse with the militia patrols, you don\u2019t understand why since you were keeping a low profile. That was the whole point of getting out the drug trade.\n\nYour gambling game room hasn\u2019t gotten raided yet, but you\u2019re getting the uneasy impression that it won\u2019t be long if this keeps up.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to have to make some changes maybe. I dunno. Maybe we need to hire another\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you can complete this thought, one of your other members comes rushing into the room.\n\n\u201cBoss! Someone is knocking at the wall and they keep saying in a taunting voice that they know we\u2019re in here. They also say they want to speak to you directly. They said that he\u2019s coming to YOU with a deal this time.\u201d Dorian remarks.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to know who that might be.\n\n\u201cShit, fucking Reynolds. Okay, we\u2019re going to let him in\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Vaughn exclaims.\n\u201cHe\u2019s already here and knows. If we just ignore him he\u2019ll just make things worse for us. I never like dealing with him either, but I usually at least hear him out. However, we\u2019re not going in this unprepared. Everyone in this place get yourself armed and ready. Load up any crossbows and firearms and keep them close! Dorian, I want people by the front entrance AND I want them in the escape tunnel just in fucking case. I wouldn\u2019t put it past Reynolds to know about that shit.\u201d\n\u201cGot it boss, anything else?\u201d Dorian asks.\n\u201cYeah, ONLY let him in. If he\u2019s got a creepy ass guy with a goatee or a weird looking ogre with him don\u2019t let them in. Vaughn you better go with him.\u201d\n\u201cOn it.\u201d Vaughn says and the pair of them leave, while you\u2019re rechecking your flintlock and grab your spare.\n\nYou practice a few times pulling your pistols as quick as you can along with drawing your sword because you have no idea how this is going down.\n\nEventually Vaughn enters with Mr. Reynolds who looks smug as usual.\n\n\u201cMmm, this isn\u2019t a bad little place. Your dwarven friend did a nice job. I assume that\u2019s what all those dwarves were really doing down here years back. Certainly couldn\u2019t be fixing the sewers. I swear if you took the Council\u2019s collective intelligence together you might have enough brains to put your shoes on the right feet assuming you didn\u2019t drool all over yourself first. Well, things are going to change when I get elected.\u201d Mr. Reynolds remarks.\n\u201cElected? Wait? YOU\u2019RE running?\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh yes, I feel it\u2019s time someone started doing things right in this city for a change. I mean sure Klyton is better off than a place like Holgard or definitely Hessla, but we can always do better you know? I\u2019ve lived here a long time and I think the only way things are going improve is if I can be in a better position. Of course I\u2019ll have to give up my old business, but Henry is willing to take that over. He\u2019s come along nicely in that regard.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s all this got to do with me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cQuite a bit actually\u2026you seem tense. Everyone here seems tense. Relax everyone, I came here alone and my presence here is a good thing.\u201d Mr. Reynolds reassures you.\n\u201cI find that hard to believe\u2026but state your agenda.\u201d\n\u201cAlways to the point. That\u2019s why I think I\u2019ve always enjoyed not just doing business with you, but your family in general. Anyway, the Crimson Talons are a black eye on this good city. Now granted I understand you aren\u2019t really hurting anyone and you do keep a relatively low profile, but well\u2026you guys need to go. Getting rid of you lot would really help show I\u2019m dedicated to cleaning up scum. No offense of course.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow wait, before you start threatening violence, I have a proposal. Instead of just reporting your exact location to the militia and being active in your execution or incarceration, it would be even better for me, if I could\u2026what\u2019s the word\u2026tame\u2026no civilize\u2026no\u2026 ah assimilate you lot instead. It would prove that this city doesn\u2019t need to waste most of its money on security. I mean come on, they hardly need half the force they employ to even take you guys out to begin with.\u201d Reynolds says with a chuckle.\n\nYou\u2019re hardly amused.\n\n\u201cYes, I can see you want me to get to the point. Fine. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to the plight of the poor folks. I understand that there needs to be an entertainment place that caters to the lesser clientele. You and your Talons do provide that service a bit. So what I\u2019m proposing is you guys do it legitimately. I\u2019m opening up a new gambling hall as part of my Council election and I want all you lot to work there. And you m\u2019boy get to run the place. Now how\u2019s THAT sound to you?\u201d Reynolds says.\n\u201cSounds too good to be true and that there has to be a catch.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell\u2026you lot WOULD have to vote for me. And in your case you\u2019d need to go register as a proper Klyton citizen. Don\u2019t believe you were actually born here were you? Other than that? None at all. I mean I would get some of the profits obviously since I would own the place, but really what\u2019s that compared to your freedom?\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re sure that Mr. Reynolds finds the use of that word amusing considering you\u2019re essentially at his mercy.\n\nHe\u2019s probably been planning this for a while. Makes sense now that he wanted you completely out of Klyton the last time you nearly dealt with him.\n\nStill it\u2019s not a bad deal considering your time as a rogue is obviously coming to an end here in Klyton. You sometimes feel more like a manager than a crime boss nowadays anyway. What\u2019s one more step to legitimacy?\n\nThough it also rubs you the wrong way of getting forced into this situation and part of you just wants to kill Mr. Reynolds for his presumption. You don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019s more than he appears, but he\u2019s also over confident and he\u2019s in here with not just you, but several others ready to do your bidding.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Mr. Reynolds", "result": "You had it with this asshole.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything; you just pull out your flintlock. Mr. Reynolds\u2019 eyes flinch a bit and he moves his hand up in front of him, but he doesn\u2019t quiet do it quick enough before you manage to catch him in the shoulder. He falls backwards in his chair.\n\nBefore you can follow up with your other pistol, Vaughn has no missed a beat and has taken it upon himself to shoot Reynolds with his own pistol. He gets a headshot, splattering part of Reynolds face and brain matter on your floor. At which point Reynolds begins making these horrible screeching sounds and twitching violently. They aren\u2019t normal human sounds of pain either. Indeed if Mr. Reynolds was human he shouldn\u2019t be making any more noise at all. Of course you always suspected there was something more to him.\n\nYou and Vaughn both start chopping and stabbing him repeatedly to make sure he\u2019s dead, until you start hearing noise, shouting and screams coming from outside your office.\n\nWith Reynolds no longer moving, you and Vaughn rush out of your office and see several of your people running away from where the escape exit is located.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d you shout at the nearest Talon running by.\n\u201cSomeone broke in through the escape tunnel and is killing our people!\u201d\n\u201cThe militia?\u201d\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s just one guy!\u201d the Talon says and runs past you.\n\u201cFuck, it\u2019s that asshole\u2019s son. So much for Reynolds claiming he didn\u2019t come alone.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShit, that\u2019s guy\u2019s a fucking killer.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cYeah, well you can run if you want, but I\u2019m not.\u201d You say and head back to your office where you have a little something extra for Henry. Vaughn reluctantly follows and stands by the door. He\u2019s got his faults, but he\u2019s always loyal.\n\nYou open up one of your safes and grab two firebombs. No sooner have you also grabbed a torch off the wall, you hear Vaughn shouting and the sounds of combat. You turn around and see Vaughn up against a wall struggling to not get a dagger pushed into his throat by Henry.\n\nYou don\u2019t think, you just act.\n\n\u201cSorry Vaughn.\u201d You whisper, light the bomb with the torch and throw it in the direction of Vaughn and Henry. You then duck down behind your desk for cover.\n\nA loud deafening explosion soon follows. While your desk protects you from the immediate detonation, it is blasted enough that part of it is no longer covering you at all and you probably would have had large wood splinters and chunks embedded into your flesh had you not been wearing appropriate protection.\n\nYou slowly get up despite your ears still ringing. There\u2019s smoke everywhere though the small fires burning lumps of bloody flesh are allowing you to see through it.\n\nMr. Reynold\u2019s body which was a bloody mess to begin with, is now practically just a smeared blood stain on your floor.\n\nA little further where the door to your office once was lies Vaughn in several burning pieces.\n\nAfter coughing a bit from the smell and the smoke, you finally see your target, Henry who apparently still isn\u2019t dead.\n\nHe\u2019s burnt, bloody, and attempting to crawl away with one arm intact, but some how still alive. He\u2019s making the same horrible raspy sounds his dad was making when you killed him.\n\nYou take your sword and walk over to the charred form that is Henry and drive it through the back of his neck. His sounds cease altogether.\n\nAs you\u2019re pulling your sword back out, your hearing is starting to return back to normal which allows you to receive the sounds of shouting. It sounds far away, but it\u2019s coming from the front entrance. Upon a quick glance, you see that the fools who ran off didn\u2019t bother shutting the wall properly and now combined with the noise of the explosion your headquarters is probably going to be crawling with any militia that was patrolling down here.\n\nTime to go.\n\nAs you\u2019re muttering about how much this situation sucks, you silently are just glad you\u2019ve got an alternative way out of this place.\n\nYou pass several bodies as you make your way towards the escape tunnel. Henry really did a damn job on your people. It\u2019s just a good thing you had people near the escape tunnel otherwise Henry might have caught even you unawares. Still, while it doesn\u2019t surprised you that Reynolds knew about it, you\u2019re wondering HOW he found out. Part of you even wonders if maybe he had connections to that dwarven bastard Grahk.\n\nYou guess it hardly matters at this point. You\u2019ve worn out your welcome at this city and you\u2019re going to have to find some place new. Perhaps Hessla?\n\nYou get to the door to the tunnel and are surprised to find it closed. You would have thought with all the running and killing nobody would have bothered. You open it up.\n\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d\n\nYou see standing before you Junior holding some sort of weapon you\u2019ve never seen before but flames flicker from the barrel. He\u2019s wearing goggles, some sort of weird one piece suit covering his massive body and flashes a toothy smile.\n\nBefore you can close the door, Junior pulls the trigger on his weapon and a gout of flame envelopes your entire body. You turn and scream as your skin and hair burn and sizzle.\n\nYour attempts to roll on the ground to put out the fire are useless since Junior just follows you from a safe distance and keeps immolating you.\n\nEventually your burning body joins the other lifeless ones around you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Work for Mr. Reynolds", "result": "While it might be satisfying to kill Mr. Reynolds, it\u2019s hardly the smart play and you\u2019re just going to bring more trouble on yourself.

I\u2019ve been thinking, we\u2019ve already been changing basic YD so much that it\u2019s not really the same product anymore. It might as well have a new name. Also it sounds a lot nicer don\u2019t you think? I mean what could be better than one of those friendly angels that the Joachim priests talk about? An angel that takes you and flies you up higher than you\u2019ve ever been. Makes it sound a lot more enticing than a devil dragging you down to hell or melting you.\u201d Camid says excitedly.\n\nYou have to admit, it\u2019s one of the better ideas he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cHmm, yeah. Actually I\u2019ve been wondering if we should start expanding and I\u2019m not talking about just here. I\u2019m talking to other places like Hessla, Holgard or even the Delantium Kingdom. I might send you Vaughn to go get another Crimson Talon chapter started.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMe? I dunno boss. I mean I suppose Hessla would be okay, but Holgard and the Delantium Kingdom? Isn\u2019t that Ebony Claw territory?\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cWhat if it is? The kingdom is a big fucking place. They don\u2019t get to have all of it and who knows what\u2019s going on in Holgard and who\u2019s in charge there. The place keeps having rebellions and revolutions. Seems like the place is up for grabs for anyone.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so boss. I feel I should also inform you that the militia has been stepping up patrols in the sewers and starting to go into areas they previously were leaving alone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to be directly dealing with that. I want us to start trapping the patrol locations first. No direct attacks yet, but those might be coming soon.\u201d\n\u201cBy the gods, we\u2019re actually taking on the militia?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cWe are, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get them off our backs at this point. We need to make it so bad for them that the costs are going to outweigh the benefits and they\u2019ll be better off going back to busting meltbrains than trying to wipe us out.\u201d\n\u201cBut taking on the militia is surely going to require all the resources we have. I mean if you send me and a few others to open up another Crimson Talon chapter elsewhere, won\u2019t you be risking getting overwhelmed by the militia?\u201d\n\u201cWell that is certainly a risk, but if you\u2019re successful where I send you, that\u2019s extra revenue and support in the long run which will help in fighting off those militia bastards.\u201d\n\nVaughn looks a little unconvinced, but like the loyal member he\u2019s always been, he just agrees with you. He doesn\u2019t really have a choice anyway.\n\nYour choice is determining where to send him. The Delantium Kingdom might be a bit far for right now. You figure Hessla or Holgard will be good enough. You actually even think about Teckleville, though you aren\u2019t sure if a small town like that would be that ideal.\n\nAlso, despite the fact you got run out of there, you still consider it home and you\u2019re a little hesitant to start flooding it with Yellow Angel and recruiting from there. So you immediately dismiss the idea.", "action_results": [{"action": "Expand to Hessla", "result": "Vaughn is going to be more comfortable going to Hessla and it\u2019s closer so that\u2019s probably the best place to expand.\n\nAfter supplying Vaughn with a good portion of Yellow Angel, you send him and a couple outright thugs and one of Camid\u2019s \u201capprentices\u201d on their way to Hessla. You tell him you want someone to send you a report on the situation by the end of the month.\n\nIn the meantime you have everyone available to start trapping portions of the sewers and continue business as usual.\n\nOne month later\n\nYou finally get a report from Vaughn and he tells you that things aren\u2019t going as well as hoped.\n\nHessla apparently isn\u2019t quite as lawless as imagined It actually does have it\u2019s own security called the Headsmen. They\u2019re fairly vigilant and they report directly to governor Tolen who has complete control over everything that goes on in the town.\n\nWhat this all means is selling your Yellow Angel there is perfectly fine, in fact it\u2019s even getting popular, but Tolen is taking fifty percent of the profits!\n\nThere isn\u2019t much Vaughn can do though, for now he says you can\u2019t expect much profit funneling in from Hessla at this time though he\u2019s looking for potential opportunities. You don\u2019t hold out much hope though given that this is Vaughn and has never excelled in that field.\n\nOn the Klyton front things aren\u2019t much better. The militia has suffered some set backs, but it\u2019s clear they aren\u2019t going to give up. Camid has made steps to set up smaller labs not just in the sewers, but even topside in the more run down areas of Klyton. The best way to keep them off balance is to not let them focus too much attention on any one location.\n\nYou think your next investment is going to be in more gunpowder weapons.\n\nYear 29\n\n\u201cSo what does Vaughn say?\u201d Camid asks.\n\u201cHe says that he\u2019s finally worked out a better deal with Governor Tolen, but it\u2019s going to require me to be there to hammer out the details.\u201d You say after reading the message scroll.\n\u201cOh. So when are you going?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure. As soon as possible given how important this is, but I almost hate to leave since I\u2019ll be concerned about everything that\u2019s going on here without me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it boss! I can look after things while you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nWhile Camid might be genuinely trying to be helpful, ever since the complete transfer to selling Yellow Angel, he\u2019s been getting puffed up with his own relative importance. A guy like him and ambition are a dangerous combo.\n\nHe already seems eager for you to leave, is he planning something?\n\nStill, this is a pretty important meeting and honestly things are probably never going to completely be calm in Klyton. You\u2019re just going to have to have a measure of confidence in Camid that he\u2019ll be able to handle shit and isn\u2019t smart enough to plot anything meaningful against you.\n\n\u201cAlright Camid, you\u2019re up, but we\u2019re going to go over so fucking ground rules of how I expect shit to be run around here in my absence.\u201d You reply.\n\nYou spend a good portion of the day going over plans, routines and what to do in certain events. He\u2019s up to speed on most of the stuff, and is at least making the effort to seem completely compliant to your orders.\n\nWith some slight apprehension, you pack some of your stuff and leave for Hessla the next day. You wish you could take a carriage to get there quicker, but given the situation with the militia; you\u2019d rather not risk being seen in public around Klyton at all.\n\nYour journey to Hessla doesn\u2019t take too long however and it\u2019s relatively uneventful. Vaughn told you in the message to meet him at the Sensual Siren tavern and he\u2019d be there every day until you showed up.\n\nAs you\u2019re asking for directions and walking about the town, you see that Hessla is indeed much different than you imagined. It\u2019s more orderly and many times you see groups of the infamous Headsmen that Governor Tolen employs to keep the peace.\n\nEventually you reach the Sensual Siren and after looking about the dark tavern, a familiar voice calls over to you.\n\n\u201cHey Boss! Over here!\u201d Vaughn shouts and waves you over.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since you\u2019ve seen him, but Vaughn look a lot different. He\u2019s shaved his facial hair in a fancier style and is dressed more\u2026\u201dpiratey.\u201d You also notice several Headsmen in the tavern who are watching everything going on in the place.\n\n\u201cWell looks like you\u2019ve gone native.\u201d You say sitting down.\n\u201cOh. Yeah all this. I figured I should look more the part around here. It doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t care. Dress how you like. So are we going to go see Tolen now? I\u2019m a little anxious to get this meeting over with because I\u2019d rather not have Camid running things for too long while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I understand. How is everything in Klyton anyway?\u201d\n\u201cSame old shit. Trying to stay one step ahead of the militia and still keep everything running.\u201d\n\u201cWell I think this new deal I\u2019ve struck with the governor will put an end to some of that hassle.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good, so let\u2019s go see the man.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, um these gentlemen will be accompanying us. The governor\u2019s sort of a stickler about security.\u201d Vaughn says pointing to the Headsmen in the tavern.\n\nYou look around and see they\u2019re starting gather near you.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah I figured the governor would have a shit load of his men around at all times. Whatever makes him feel safe I guess, let\u2019s get going.\u201d You say.\n\nYou, Vaughn and a small group of Headsmen all leave the tavern. As you head towards the mansion where the governor, Vaughn talks about how well the Crimson Talon chapter here is doing and that there is possibility of extending to a city called Jicol which lies across the sea. He says the place sounds like it\u2019s open territory.\n\nWhile you\u2019re listening to Vaughn, you start to notice that you\u2019re taking a lot of turns that don\u2019t seem necessary to get to the mansion, which appeared to be a relatively straightforward walk from what you could tell. You look around and you start to feel uneasy as the streets start to get narrow.\n\nNo sooner have you start to put your hand by your weapon when Vaughn suddenly shoves you aside and runs forward. It isn\u2019t enough to knock you down, but it\u2019s enough to catch you off balance and the Headsmen have taken advantage by nabbing you.\n\nYou struggle to get free, but the Headsmen have firmly got you restrained. Followed by a few punches and kicks, along with taking away all your weapons and you have the distinct impression that you were paranoid about the wrong person betraying you.\n\nYou look up and see Vaughn now standing before you with a dagger in hand. He doesn\u2019t look happy, but he isn\u2019t exactly upset about this either.\n\n\u201cGotta say, didn\u2019t see this coming from you. Guess more than just your style changed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cStand him up.\u201d Vaughn remarks which causes the Headsmen to do just that.\n\n\u201cBetter deal huh Vaughn? Was this the governor\u2019s idea, or yours? Probably the governor. You never would have had the balls to think of doing this without help.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Vaughn says and approaches you with the dagger.\n\u201cWhat for? I\u2019m going to shut up forever soon. I will say this, at least you\u2019re doing this yourself and looking me in the eye.\u201d\n\nWhen you say this, Vaughn drops his guard and looks away a bit.\n\n\u201cHeh, I was right, this wasn\u2019t your idea. Fucking pathetic.\u201d You say.\n\nVaughn then musters up his resolve and shoved the dagger into your stomach. He then pulls it out and stabs you several more times. You never cry out once and you never stop looking at him the whole time despite the fact he tries to advert his gaze downward most of the time. He never says anything else.\n\nEventually several of your vital organs have been punctured enough and your blood is leaking out of several holes. The Headsmen that were restraining you drop your body and leave it for the street cleaners to dispose of properly.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Expand to Holgard", "result": "If anything you\u2019ve learned here in Klyton, it\u2019s that it isn\u2019t so much the law and order that makes being a criminal suck, it\u2019s when everything is legalized that makes it suck.\n\nDespite the rebellion problems in Holgard, you know there is always some sort of iron fisted tyrant in charge that puts restrictions on shit. You\u2019ll probably get a better price for Yellow Angel there rather than Hessla where every substance is acceptable and most likely cheap.\n\nWhile the Ebony Claw is a concern, you can\u2019t quake in fear of them. In fact other than the story Tom told you a long time ago, they have never been a factor in Klyton. Maybe it\u2019s time to see if they live up to their reputation.\n\nAfter supplying Vaughn with a good portion of Yellow Angel, you send him and a couple outright thugs and one of Camid\u2019s \u201capprentices\u201d on their way to Holgard.

One of our boys is here.\u201d Dorian tells you.\n\u201cFinally. I hope he\u2019s got good news. Send him in.\u201d you say.\n\u201cUm, okay, but I should add, he doesn\u2019t look so good. He says there\u2019s some problems\u201d\n\u201cWonderful. Well he can tell me himself, just send him in already.\u201d\n\nAs you wait for the messenger. You just ponder what the hell the problems could be. You\u2019re guessing maybe with the ECS. If Vaughn is asking for more help, your answer is going to be you can\u2019t spare it. You\u2019re having a hard enough time with the militia who haven\u2019t let up despite you making things difficult for them.\n\nWhen the messenger comes in, he\u2019s carrying a box held closely to his chest. You notice he\u2019s not only missing an eye, but he\u2019s also missing a hand. You don\u2019t remember this one\u2019s name, but this was one of the bigger men you sent with Vaughn.\n\nThis really doesn\u2019t look good.\n\n\u201cBoss\u2026the Ebony Claws\u2026we got our asses kicked! We\u2019re undone! Everything is lost!\u201d the big man shouts.\n\u201cCalm yourself. What the fuck is going on?\u201d\n\u201cThis! This is going on!\u201d the man shouts and tosses the box on your desk.\n\nYou already got a bad feeling about what\u2019s in the box, but you open it anyway. It\u2019s only half surprising that you find Vaughn\u2019s bloody head in it. The ECS also went out of its way to carve its symbol into his forehead.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you shout angrily.\n\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d the big man starts to say.\n\u201cBesides you is there anyone left?\u201d\n\u201cNo!

Gotta think\u2026\u201d\n\nYou start pacing a bit as you think, but the big man still lingers around\n\n\u201cBoss, we gotta get out of here!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you on about?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe Ebony Claws! They\u2019re coming!\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re saying the Syndicate is coming here?\u201d\n\u201cYes! We gotta go!\u201d\n\u201cWhile I get that you\u2019ve probably suffered a bit of torture, but you need to find your strength or get the fuck out of my face. If the Claws are coming here, then I\u2019m going to repay every one of the men they killed with ten of theirs. Them coming here is just going to make it easier. Let them fucking come! I\u2019m going to be prepared!\u201d\n\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand! They\u2019re coming RIGHT NOW! We\u2026we\u2026told them everything! They know all about the hidden exit tunnel to this place! They only just released me a few moments ago to distract you.\u201d\n\nYour expression drops to one of anger to one of unease, but it doesn\u2019t stop you from pulling out your pistol and shooting the pathetic snitch that just sold you out.\n\n\u201cEVERYONE GET READY, WE\u2019RE UNDER ATTACK!\u201d you shout and walk past the snitch\u2019s body.\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s already too late. The Ebony Claw Syndicate has already infiltrated the escape tunnel and its members are already inside doing battle with your people, which aren\u2019t many in comparison. The Syndicate apparently decided not to fuck around when considering you a potential threat. It might be flattering if your life wasn\u2019t in grave danger.\n\nAfter dispatching a couple of the ebony claws, your goal is to leave through the \u201cfront door\u201d and hopefully escape to the Yellow Angel lab where you can regroup with Camid, assuming that place hasn\u2019t been invaded as well.\n\nYou get to the front door as the last of your Talons struggle against the Claws. As soon as you do, you get a bolt in your forehead. It all happens so fast, you don\u2019t think you even notice the one who shot you even though they had to be directly in front of you at the time.\n\nYou just stand there, blink and then fall backwards to the floor as your followers die screaming around you.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Madeline", "result": "It might seem to be the less traditional choice of the three, but not having to pay her is a big plus.

What the fuck are you thinking?!\u201d Zalmora exclaims when she hears the news.\n\u201cI have to agree with Zal on this. We don\u2019t know much about her other than Camid\u2019s praises.\u201d Vaughn adds.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to meet her. If she\u2019s everything Camid claims then we\u2019ll proceed. If not, I can have Camid flogged for wasting my time and we\u2019ll go back to picking one your people.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I\u2019m certainly going to be asking her some questions.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cNo. YOU aren\u2019t going to be doing anything. I\u2019m going to see her alone, without anyone else\u2019s input. The decision will be final and mine only. I know you like to think you\u2019re the one who runs things around here Zal, but you aren\u2019t and you don\u2019t get a say this time. Deal with it.\u201d\n\nZal purses her lips and gives you an irritated look for a moment, but then she forces a smile and nods.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d She says and leaves. Vaughn just wishes you good luck with your meeting with Madeline and follows Zal.\n\nLater, Camid arrives before you with a young red head with an ample chest. She\u2019s dressed \u201cdown\u201d presumably to look like she fits in, but its still obvious she is out of place here. Must be Madeline.\n\n\u201cThis is the girl I mentioned. Madeline.\u201d Camid says.\n\u201cI thought as much. I trust you\u2019ve told her some of what this is all about right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah, boss.\u201d\n\u201cGood, less for me to explain then. Thank you Camid, you may leave now.\u201d\n\nCamid looks a bit confused at first since he probably thought he was going to be involved in someway, but after waving him away he gets the message leaving you alone with Madeline.\n\n\u201cSo, Camid tells me you\u2019re an engineering student at the top of your class.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah\u2026got anything to drink?\u201d Madeline responds while walking and looking around.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t partake. I need a clear head to run this place.\u201d You say.\n\u201cReally? Would have thought all you had to do is kick people around.\u201d\n\u201cI wish it was that simple. Unfortunately it isn\u2019t. Though speaking of clear heads, I\u2019m a little concerned with yours.\u201d\n\u201cOh? This should be good.\u201d Madeline says with a tone of snark that you decide to ignore for now.\n\u201cYes. My concern is if you\u2019re as intelligent as Camid claims you are, one wonders why the hell you\u2019re hanging around a bunch of criminals. For kicks? Well I can see that I suppose, but Yellow Devil? Come on, surely a girl like you knows the dangers of doing that vile drug.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you my dad?\u201d\n\u201cNo, just concerned about how reliable you\u2019re going to be. If you\u2019re genuinely interested in working for us or you\u2019re just being a rebel against your real dad and mildly self-destructive.\u201d\n\nYou sit up a bit from your chair and lean in on your desk.\n\n\u201cConvince me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIs this where I have to suck your dick?\u201d Madeline asks in a tone almost implying that she could care less if she actually has to or not.\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026no girl. There\u2019s no cock sucking involved. I just want to know more about why you\u2019re even interested in doing this.\u201d\n\nMadeline for the first time stops acting so casual about this situation and starts taking it seriously.\n\nShe goes on to say she isn\u2019t going to tell you her life story, but she wants to make it clear that while you\u2019re probably right on some level about her finding a thrill in all this, she\u2019s genuinely interested in his project from a scholastic point of view too. Namely helping you build an underground headquarters will give her some \u201clife experience\u201d and real chance to use what she\u2019s learning and has already learned especially since she doesn\u2019t hold out hope that she\u2019s going to get a \u201creal job\u201d after she graduates.\n\n\u201cWhy would that be the case? You\u2019re rich aren\u2019t you? Surely you can get some strings pulled and you could work anywhere.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cYeah, if I ask my dad for help and I get too much from him as it is\u2026anyway I might very well get a job, but I\u2019m not actually going to work. You\u2019re probably not aware, but women don\u2019t exactly populate the field and tends to be an old boy\u2019s club. As a result it doesn\u2019t matter how high my grades are, I\u2019m never going to get a project where I\u2019m actually going to be involved in any meaningful way. At best I\u2019d just be kept around so guys stare at my tits all day. If I were a dwarf, it wouldn\u2019t matter what gender I was. (Sigh) Humanity sucks sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I think I understand your position now. You\u2019re using this opportunity to ply your desired trade. That\u2019s actually a reasonable mindset, if an unconventional way to go about it. I still have a few more concerns, but you can tell me more, just let me get my layout plans of what I\u2019m envisioning.\u201d\n\nMadeline talks a bit more about herself and how she first met Camid in the first place. It was basically a typical \u201cwild night\u201d with some of her other university associates and they came down to the sewers to \u201clive dangerously.\u201d She actually says she didn\u2019t really want to take Yellow Devil in the first place and it was just a stupid dare the first time. She also says that she\u2019s long since known that Camid isn\u2019t giving her the real stuff. In fact she says she\u2019s not even interested in taking it anymore.\n\nFrom what you can tell, you\u2019re still somewhat correct about her being a little self-destructive. While her self esteem isn\u2019t so low that she\u2019s outright suicidal, there\u2019s definitely enough dissatisfaction in her existence that it\u2019s caused her to not enjoy her life of privilege and instead hang around a violent criminal organization. Probably daddy issues as well given that he\u2019s brought up a couple times and she quickly doesn\u2019t want to talk about him. (Mother is apparently dead) You even try to ask who he is, but she just assures you that he\u2019s not on the Klyton Council if that\u2019s what you were wondering about.\n\nHowever, she seems to perk up quite a bit when she goes through your lay out plans. She starts changing your original plan quite a bit, but she\u2019s respectful the entire time and explains why for everything.\n\nOne thing that she mentions that you didn\u2019t expect is her recommendation for labor.\n\n\u201cGoblins? Seriously?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes. Next to dwarves, they\u2019re the next best civilized race that has a natural affinity to digging tunnels and building lasting underground structures and not having them collapse. In fact I read when Klyton had vast amounts of miners, the human union made such a stink to the company about employing goblins because they would work cheaper and longer hours. So there were never any proper goblin miners, at least never for long. Most of them are usually in the poorer areas of Klyton as dung sweepers and such, though I know one on campus as a janitor and I\u2019ve spoken with him several times. We\u2019re almost friends in a weird way. I think if I convince him, he can easily gather up more of his buddies.\u201d Madeline remarks.\n\u201cHm, interesting. Well, I suppose we\u2019ll gather the rest of equipment.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got that under control. Um, can I stay here the night and look over these plans and this map of the sewers? I really want to get started on working on designing a new layout and where the best location would be for your headquarters.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 sure. Don\u2019t you have school though?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have a class for a couple days. I\u2019m good until then.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well I can have a room for you. Can\u2019t do anything about the lingering smell I\u2019m afraid, but then that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re trying to design a place not actually in the damn sewer.\u201d\n\nMadeline thanks you and you see her out the door.\n\nAs strange as this arrangement is, you have a positive feeling about it, though you\u2019re still going to remain cautiously optimistic until you actually see some work from her.\n\nIn the meantime, you can imagine the comments you\u2019re going to get from Zal about this, but then what else is new?", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 26\n\n\u201cYour school girl would go a lot faster if she was a REAL engineer and didn\u2019t have to leave every once in awhile to go attend classes. And why are we building in two different locations again?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cBecause Madeline pointed out that it might be better if we didn\u2019t build everything in one place. Said it would be easier to keep the support structurally sound as well if we didn\u2019t build too big. I think it\u2019s coming along fine so far, though the ceilings are a little low. Guess goblins aren\u2019t used to building them high though.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cConsidering you\u2019re spending as much money as you are for this shit, I certainly hope she\u2019s at least a good lay.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not fucking her.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGreat. So you\u2019re just wasting money for no gain whatsoever.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting our new locations! By the fucking gods, what the hell is your problem today?\u201d\n\u201cMy problem is we could have had a real professional do this and probably be done by now. This little school bitch doesn\u2019t know what the fuck is doing and we got goblins running around being the obnoxious little green shits they always are.\u201d\n\u201cActually I haven\u2019t had any problem with any of them.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, they\u2019re fucking annoying.\u201d\n\u201cZal, I\u2019m not going to argue about this anymore. Things are going just fine, you\u2019re just finding shit to nitpick about.\u201d\n\u201cHave it your way, but here\u2019s one more for the road. If you REALLY aren\u2019t fucking big tits McRed, you better have a little chat with her because I\u2019ve seen how she acts when you speak with each other. Maybe you\u2019re oblivious, but the girl has a serious crush on you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201d You snort.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. You don\u2019t notice how chipper she is when she speaks to you? How she makes these girly giggles over shit you say which isn\u2019t even funny half the time? How she makes every effort to be very close or even touch your arm or hand when you\u2019re around? If the girl was anymore obvious, she\u2019d have her legs wrapped around you.\u201d\n\nNow that you think about it, Zal isn\u2019t wrong on her observations. Madeline\u2019s personality has been a lot more positive since the first time you met her.\n\nThough it makes you wonder\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, so say maybe she does, what I find interesting is how you\u2019ve been studying our relationship and interaction. Are you jealous?\u201d you say with a chortle.\n\u201cHah! Typical male ego. You wish. But I\u2019ll tell you who IS jealous, Camid.\u201d Zalmora retorts.\n\u201cCamid?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the repulsive guy in charge of Yellow Devil creation and distribution and stinks of Yellow Devil fumes most of the time? There are already rumors going on about you fucking schoolgirl, I can\u2019t imagine Camid is happy about that, still being her boyfriend and all. I\u2019ve seen this happen before and it never ends well. So if you don\u2019t want a knife suddenly in your back, like I said, you better straighten out this misunderstanding\u2026or at least tell a convincing lie.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on with Madeline!\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not the one you have to convince. I\u2019ll leave you to it boss man, I mean we all know you\u2019re the one who runs everything here.\u201d Zal says and leaves.\n\nYou hate it when she makes sense.\n\nWhile you had better things to do today, you probably should talk to both of them and do it now just to get it out of the way.\n\nSince you\u2019re not exactly in the mood to breath in Yellow Devil fumes right now, you decide to go see Madeline first who as far as you know is overseeing work on the other location. You might as well check on that while you\u2019re at it.\n\nAfter an uneventful walk in the sewers, you get to the location. So far it doesn\u2019t look much different than your future headquarters, though the rooms are bigger.\n\nIn the biggest of these rooms, you find Madeline ordering about a few goblins in their native language. It\u2019s weird how they don\u2019t mind taking her orders. When they see you, they move even quicker.\n\nMadeline turns and sees you as well. She smiles and immediately walks quickly over to you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here! I didn\u2019t expect to see you so soon after the last time you inspected this place. I would have doubled the work time on it!\u201d Madeline beams. You get the impression that she nearly was going to hug you, but stopped herself.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019d rather you take a little extra time to make sure everything is secure. So is this room going to be where we hold the fighting games?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, that was my intention. I think it might need more expansion, and of course we\u2019re going to make it look better than it currently does, but it\u2019s well on its way!\u201d\n\u201cWell I can honestly say you are doing a fine job, and best of all, it isn\u2019t costing me a lot. I gotta talk to you about something though.\u201d\n\u201cMe too! But first I have to show you this, come with me!\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay.\u201d\n\nMadeline walks ahead of you first, but when you aren\u2019t moving fast enough, she actually pulls your hand in an effort to get you to follow faster.\n\nYou soon enter a small partially dug out room that has a single lantern lighting it. You don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary here.\n\n\u201cMadeline, what\u2026\u201d you start to ask, and before you know it, she\u2019s all over you.\n\nAfter about a couple of minutes of slobbering over each other, Madeline finally comes up for air.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve wanted to do this\u2026\u201d she says and then goes in to try to kiss you again before you stop her.\n\n\u201cMadeline! Hold on! I\u2026can\u2019t\u2026WE can\u2019t do this. I think you\u2019ve gotten the wrong idea!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t seem like it when you had your tongue in my mouth and your hand on my ass a few moments ago.\u201d Madeline says.\n\u201cYou\u2026you caught me by surprise! I\u2019m only human damn it! Look, you\u2019re obviously a very attractive girl and maybe you\u2019re into me because I\u2019m being supportive in your dreams or something, but we can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWell for one thing, you\u2019re Camid\u2019s girlfriend and people are already whispering untrue rumors about us. I mean if you were just some whore, it probably wouldn\u2019t be a big deal because\u2026well whores are a whores and everyone is supposed to be fucking them. But you\u2019re not a whore and you\u2019re in a real relationship with another Crimson Talon. Stealing someone else\u2019s girlfriend is just bad for business. It creates hard feelings and much worse.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re dealing drugs, running illegal fights, and other activities but being with someone who would rather be with you is where you draw the line?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s gotta be a line drawn somewhere. Otherwise this all falls apart. You know, like a support beam for the tunnels you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re the boss, can\u2019t you just do what you want?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. The key to being in charge is also trying not to be hated. And what about Camid? I thought you and he were together.\u201d\n\u201cEh, he was okay at first, but now....well I find him\u2026limited. I\u2019d rather be with you. I like the way I feel when you\u2019re around encouraging me. Camid doesn\u2019t understand anything that I talk about. He just stares at my tits and wants to fuck.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m not doing the same thing?\u201d\n\u201cObviously you aren\u2019t, because if you did, we\u2019d be fucking right now. My point is, I feel like I can at least converse with you about a variety of things. I mean maybe you don\u2019t understand all my technical university speak, but I know you\u2019re at least on my intellectual level.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026thanks? I think?\u201d\n\u201cPlus\u2026this isn\u2019t just some stupid crush like you probably think it is. You\u2019ve been so nice to me. I think\u2026I think I\u2019m really starting to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help my feelings towards you! Oh I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just kill Camid so we can be together!\u201d Madeline exclaims and then hugs you tightly and trying not to cry.\n\nAnd that intensified quickly.\n\n\u201cMadeline. (Sigh) Look. You\u2019re experiencing a phase. You don\u2019t seriously want any sort of long term relationship with someone like me. I mean if you think I\u2019m any better than Camid, you\u2019re only thinking that because I find you useful in a capacity that doesn\u2019t involve sex. I\u2019m NOT a nice guy. Just ask anyone. Hell, talk with Zalmora. She\u2019ll be the first one to tell you all my shortcomings.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a phase though\u2026\u201d Madeline says with a quiver in her voice.\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t, you\u2019re just going to have to get over it anyway. Because WE are not happening. I\u2019m not looking for anyone long term and I don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s not who I am. Apologies.\u201d\n\nMadeline now starts to cry quietly.\n\n\u201cNow if this is just too much for you, I\u2019ll completely understand if you don\u2019t want to work on this project anymore. I can find someone else.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sniff) No. No\u2026I\u2019ll continue the work. I promised to see this through. I\u2026won\u2019t say anything to Camid either (sniff) I\u2019ll just get over it, like you (sob) said\u2026\u201d Madeline says before crying again.\n\nYou haven\u2019t felt nearly this bad since you left Annah back in Teckleville. Still, you feel this is for the best and hopefully Madeline can indeed \u201cget over it\u201d like she claims.\n\nAs you leave Madeline to her sadness, you move on to your next unpleasant task and that\u2019s speaking to Camid. You\u2019re not entirely sure how you\u2019re going to tell him though.\n\nAfter another uneventful walk through the sewers you get to the Yellow Devil Den. For obvious reasons you don\u2019t come here that much, because the place stinks worse than the rest of the sewers and always has junkies hanging around, acting crazy or just slowly melting. Though the melting is a little less now that Camid\u2019s made strides in cutting Yellow Devil with less lethal ingredients and still managed to maintain it\u2019s feel good effects. Still doesn\u2019t make you want to stick around though.\n\nSeveral Crimson Talons see you and let you in immediately while pushing away any junkies attempting to get in. Doesn\u2019t take you long to find Camid. He\u2019s surprised to see you. Camid and you head to his own little area where the stench of Yellow Devil fumes isn\u2019t burning your nostrils to talk.\n\nYou decide to go with a half truth and explain that you\u2019ve been hearing the concerning rumors about you and Madeline and you\u2019re here to dispel them, because it\u2019s not healthy to the organization to have something like that spread around when it isn\u2019t even true in the first place. You explain you have no interest in Madeline other than her work on the project. You even sort of imply you\u2019re actually trying to get back with Zalmora.\n\nCamid seems to react positively to your explanation with no hint of any underlining hostility. He either means it, or he\u2019s subtler than you gave him credit for. Either way, it would seem the matter is closed.\n\nYou return to work and later you see Zalmora and Vaughn.\n\n\u201cWell? Did you take care of that business?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cNot that it concerns you, but yes I did. Now let\u2019s move on to other things.\u201d You reply.\n\nThe next few days are a little tense and you stay on your guard. You half expect Camid or Madeline to do something crazy, try to kill you, or something that causes problems. None of that happens though.\n\nWeeks pass and while Madeline occasionally gives you a longing glance she never initiates anything. You try to keep your contact short with her. Camid doesn\u2019t act out of the ordinary either when you see him. Neither one mentions their relationship with each other so you assume they\u2019re still together.\n\nThen just when you think everything is settled with this situation, disaster strikes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cAfraid so boss. Camid was found dead with several large holes in him. Legs, back, chest, head, arms, everywhere.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cWell what the hell happened?\u201d\n\u201cDunno. Some of the Talons just found him in his room in the den like that. No signs of anyone breaking in or anything.\u201d\n\nZalmora just looks at you.\n\n\u201cDo I even need to say it?\u201d she asks.\n\u201c(Sigh) No. But I\u2019m wondering how she did it exactly. I just don\u2019t see her as a natural killer and Camid wasn\u2019t a push over\u2026wait a minute. Sonofabitch. She used the little green bastards! They follow everything she says. They\u2019re also small and sneaky enough to dig some little passage that only they could get in and then. You said Camid had large holes all over his body. Probably from pick axes.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little lost here, who killed Camid?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cThe love of his life, school girl killed him.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWait, why?\u201d\n\u201cGeez, Vaugh you\u2019re really behind aren\u2019t you? Our glorious leader here turned down her advances a few weeks ago. Surprised the hell out of me too, but messing with another man\u2019s girlfriend isn\u2019t one of the vices he has apparently. It appears though school girl figured out a loop hole and took matters into her own hands.\u201d Zal explains.\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she have just broke up with Camid?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cBecause that still would have caused conflict if the boss got with her. Camid isn\u2019t likely to be the type to just accept seeing someone else with his ex especially so soon and so close. Nope, had to kill him. Only logical play.\u201d\n\nZal then turns to you.\n\n\u201cWhich now I guess means the next step is yours heartbreaker.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk with Madeline", "result": "Well, she did take the initiative and solve the main problem concerning you being together. That\u2019s sort of an admirable trait.\n\nThe fact that she got her little goblin friends to do it implies she\u2019s actually a lot more dangerous than you could have imagined. You can\u2019t help but find that a little alluring, if also a little concerning.\n\nYou\u2019re also concerned with Madeline\u2019s possible mental stability if she was willing to go to this much trouble to be with you.\n\nYou stand up and start to leave.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go see Madeline.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t you want back up?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would he need back up Vaughn? I\u2019m sure he can fuck her perfectly well all by himself.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to go talk with her.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure you are.\u201d\n\nNot wishing to debate it any longer with Zal, you leave and head to where you remember Madeline was supposed to be overseeing today which is the new headquarters being built.\n\nWhen you arrive you find it strange you don\u2019t see any goblins running around going about their digging and building. In fact it\u2019s completely empty until you find Madeline sitting against the wall. She looks up when you enter the room.\n\n\u201cHi. I guess you figured it out already.\u201d She says.\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t incredibly hard to figure out. Where are all the goblins?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, I sent them to go work at the other location when they told me you were coming to talk. I figured we should be alone.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s\u2026wait. How did they know I was coming to talk? I didn\u2019t even see any of them on the way here.\u201d\n\nMadeline stands up and begins to walk over to you.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t just dig a tunnel into the Yellow Devil Den. They\u2019ve dug tunnels all over the sewers. Mostly under them. Made it easier for them to get around without having to walk about in the actual sewers. They may have also dug some tunnels near your old head quarters\u2026you know, you look very peaceful when you sleep\u2026\u201d Madeline says and goes to touch your face, but you stop her by grabbing her wrist.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019ve been watching me sleep?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cJust a few times\u2026are you going to kill me?\u201d Madeline asks.\n\u201cHonestly Madeline I don\u2019t know at this point! I mean never mind the fact that you killed one of my more productive members, but your actions are pretty damn batshit insane. You got goblins doing your bidding, you\u2019re stalking and spying on me, you showed no signs of being a killer before and yet you just killed a man who actually DID love you in his limited way. I mean you\u2019re fucking dangerous, how the hell am I supposed to trust someone like that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I love you! I did this all for you! I\u2019m doing this ALL for you! I would never hurt you!\u201d\n\nAt this point Madeline gloms on to you and unsuccessfully tries not to cry. She\u2019s holding on you like you\u2019re life itself, which is funny considering you just said you weren\u2019t sure if you going to kill her or not.\n\nYou honestly are at a bit of a loss. Instinct is screaming at you that this a bad idea, but along with the emotional shit Madeline is laying on you, it doesn\u2019t help that she feels real good against you right now.\n\nShe looks up at you with eyes mixed with hope and sadness. There\u2019s probably a tinge of madness in those eyes as well. And from there your face moves in towards hers for the kiss and you shortly after that you finally consummate this relationship.\n\nWell you made your decision with your dick\u2026again.\n\nThough to be honest when you first went to talk to her, your mind was mostly made up anyway, because despite her obvious mental problems, you really can\u2019t resist a pretty girl who is willing to do all that for you. It\u2019s a huge ego boost for one thing.\n\nAs far as any actual deeper feelings for Madeline\u2026well you can always try and it isn\u2019t like you don\u2019t have a base to work from.\n\nAfterwards Madeline attempts to cuddle with you and all that other stuff that goes along with having a \u201cproper\u201d girlfriend, but you tell her that while you\u2019d love to spend all day just being naked with her, you both have important shit to do and you have to get back to it.\n\nEventually you make your way back to headquarters and of course Zal is there. You already know what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re finally back, that must have been a very involved discussion.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to hear it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hear it from me. You\u2019re the boss, you can do what you want obviously. Camid wasn\u2019t exactly popular so it isn\u2019t like this is going to cause the eyebrows of other Talons to rise. Fairly certain most of them would have killed him to fuck schoolgirl as well, if they had the chance\u2026but then SHE was the one that set that up isn\u2019t she? You must be awfully special to her.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Zal.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you were the settling down type, but I imagine unconditional obsession wrapped in that package is a bit hard to turn down. Must be nice to be loved so unconditionally.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been working with me this long and you believed that? Hah, no wonder she got you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this, and don\u2019t you got some work to do?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m going\u2026but before I do\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHere we go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis relationship is a really bad idea. And I\u2019m not talking just for the survival of this organization, but your survival in general. This girl is not just obviously dangerous, but she\u2019s manipulative as well. You may like the attention you\u2019re getting from her now, but you might not like it when you realize you don\u2019t want it anymore. And when that day comes, it isn\u2019t going to be good.\u201d\n\u201cWell as usual, you can always leave Zalmora. You\u2019re always bitching about what I do or don\u2019t do. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll make the decision for you since you seem to be unable to. Get the hell out, you\u2019re not a Talon anymore.\u201d\n\u201cGet out of here, you don\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t! Why does it matter if you stay here anyway? I mean you\u2019ve hinted on occasion in the past that you don\u2019t really find this life as appealing anymore. So why not get out? You should be thanking me! I\u2019m giving you a rare opportunity to walk away from a criminal organization and not even asking for anything in return.\u201d\n\nZalmora at first is shocked that you would say this to her, but then she chuckles.\n\n\u201cSure, I get it. You\u2019re right, there really isn\u2019t much point in me sticking around now, and maybe it is time for me to move on with my life. Gods know I\u2019ve wasted more of it than probably should have. Anyway, I\u2019m sure school girl will be very helpful in your future endeavors. And I sincerely hope I\u2019m wrong and you and her live happily ever after or how ever that goes.\u201d\n\nZal then looks down a bit, sighs and then finishes her goodbye.\n\n\u201cOkay, well I\u2019ll just go say goodbye to Vaughn and get the hell out of your way.\u201d\n\nZal then leaves without another word.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but wonder if feelings were running a little deeper than she let on. She probably took it for granted that you wouldn\u2019t ever be involved seriously with someone else. She also took it for granted that you weren\u2019t going to eventually get tired of her shit.\n\nStill, you\u2019d be lying to yourself if you weren\u2019t going to miss her. She kept an eye on details and things organized. Now you\u2019re going to have to do all that shit yourself, because while Vaughn isn\u2019t incompetent, he\u2019s no Zal.\n\nIn the meantime, you need to get the Yellow Devil Den running at full capacity again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 28\n\nLife is good.\n\nBusiness is going well now thanks to your better locations. More people seem to prefer gambling in an area that smells tolerable for one thing. Madeline also had the goblins build a hidden entrance way topside so folks can now enter directly and not have to muck about through the sewers.\n\nYour new headquarters is also much better than the one you had in the sewers\n\nThe only business you left in the sewers was the Yellow Devil Den. Seemed fairly pointless to befoul your new locations with it and it\u2019s users. Better it should stay in the sewers.\n\nThough Madeline actually has told you she has an idea to make a special area for that too since she can easily get the goblin crew to help again. She says she plans to help you out a lot more when she isn\u2019t in school any longer. And graduation for her is coming soon, today in fact.\n\nYou never thought you\u2019d ever be visiting where your father went to learn to be a doctor, but you aren\u2019t going to miss Madeline accepting her diploma. You genuinely love her as your relationship has grown. You were a little concerned at first, but you found that while it isn\u2019t perfect, you feel pretty comfortable with her. You even have vivid dreams about her. Almost so real that you aren\u2019t even parted when you sleep. You\u2019ve told her all about your life in Teckleville, and your family. She hopes one day that maybe she can meet them, especially your sister. (You still wonder about all of them from time to time)\n\nWhile Madeline has talked about her past, she still hasn\u2019t mentioned too much about her family. Not even about her father who you know she isn\u2019t fond of, but you don\u2019t know why exactly. She just mentions she has no contact with her father other than him paying for her education. It\u2019s never a topic she wishes to discuss; she just wants to focus on the future with you, which is fine as far as you\u2019re concerned.\n\n\u201cSo how do I look?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t be my type, but you do look dapper in that suit.\u201d Vaughn says.\n\u201cI\u2019m crushed. But good, I don\u2019t want to look too out of place at Madeline\u2019s graduation.\u201d\n\u201cThey grow up so fast huh?\u201d Vaughn snorts.\n\u201cOkay, don\u2019t even go there with the dad thing. I\u2019m not even that much older than her. I trust you can look after things here for awhile?\u201d\n\u201cSure boss, no problem.\u201d\n\nYou leave Vaughn and head to the surface. You\u2019re not going to walk all the damn way to the university though, so you pay for a horse and buggy to take you there. As you ride, you realize you haven\u2019t really travelled around the city as much since you took control of the Crimson Talons. You\u2019ve mostly been stuck underground most of the time.\n\nWhen you arrive at the university you don\u2019t have too difficult of a time finding where the ceremony is taking place. The university is very clean and orderly, you briefly imagine your father walking around this place back when he was going here.\n\nEventually you get to a big open field area with several seats and a stage set up. Others are already seated so you find yourself a chair in the back.\n\nWhile nobody is staring at you, you still feel a little out of place. You just never thought you\u2019d be at a place of higher learning and attending someone\u2019s graduation ceremony.\n\nAs you wait for things to get started, someone sits next to you, when you turn to see who it is, you can\u2019t believe who it is.\n\n\u201cGlad to see you made it to my daughter\u2019s graduation.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says with a smile.\n\u201c\u2026you\u2026 YOU?! You\u2019re her father?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, and shhh. Don\u2019t make a scene. I\u2019m not here to cause problems.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d\n\u201cI guess she didn\u2019t tell you about me. She never does. (Sigh) Even after all I\u2019ve done for her. Though I suppose if she had talked about me, you would have thought twice about being with her and that would have been a shame\u2026because I know how much you make her happy and she\u2019s going to need that bit of happiness to hang on to where she\u2019s going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Where\u2019s she going?\u201d\n\nMr. Reynolds chuckles a bit.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going back home of course. Her time here is done, well for now it is anyway.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Isn\u2019t this city her home?\u201d\n\u201cKlyton is just her current place residence, but her real home is\u2026well it\u2019s very different. You might even say it\u2019s a different realm altogether.\u201d\n\nThe way Mr. Reynolds smiles at this point makes you completely tense up. You don\u2019t like whatever he\u2019s about to say.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not human m\u2019boy. Well\u2026not entirely human anyway. She\u2019s a bit of a late bloomer though with her powers, but I love her all the same. Let me ask you something though, has she been appearing in your dreams recently?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d You answer hesitantly.\n\u201cYeah, her mother will probably be coming for her soon.\u201d\n\u201cHer mother? I thought her mother was dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I just told her that her mother died in childbirth. Her mother is really a full-blooded succubus. They aren\u2019t known to be maternal until their daughters have already grown up and shown that they\u2019re worthy of their attention. Displayed powers and such. They never much bother with their male children at all though. I should know.\u201d\n\nYou have no words.\n\n\u201cOf course most of them just eat their off spring as soon as they give birth to them, but I told that bitch, no daughter of mine was going to be a snack. I\u2019ll admit, I wasn\u2019t the best father probably, but I think between me or being breakfast, well I think I\u2019ll be vindicated once Madeline finds out the truth about herself.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be even more pissed at you for NOT telling her and it just suddenly being sprung on her like this?\u201d you blurt out.\n\u201c\u2026hmmm\u2026y\u2019know I never considered that. Oh well. It isn\u2019t like she\u2019s my only child. My boy Henry starting to show a lot of promise. Can\u2019t wait for him to take over the business someday.\u201d\n\nYou almost feel like standing up and shouting Klyton has been infiltrated by demon spawn at this point. However, you\u2019ve got bigger concerns.\n\n\u201cDoes Madeline have to return? I mean can\u2019t she resist?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no debate m\u2019boy. She\u2019s going to go. I mean there probably will be an urge to resist at first, but it doesn\u2019t take long before that infernal blood pulls them in and they return to fully embrace their demon powers \u201c\n\u201cAlways?\u201d\n\u201cWell, a few sadly succeed. But I promised her mother long ago that if Madeline ever started to bloom that I would do everything possible to help that process along.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s nice! And good!\u201d you say.\n\u201cNice? Good? Ha ha ha ha! That\u2019s a cute. She\u2019s with you, how good can she really be? Plus I know how she killed her old boyfriend with her little goblin influencing powers. Shit, that\u2019s proof right there that\u2019s she\u2019s going to make a fine succubus. She\u2019s already killing boyfriends. Speaking of which, you m\u2019boy have to go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou. You have to go. I\u2019m not having my daughter not achieve her rightful destiny by holding on to her misguided love for you. Now, you can stay to see her graduate, but then you need to leave. And I don\u2019t mean just here. You need to leave the city and go some place far away. If you\u2019re dreaming about her, that means she\u2019s already starting to imprint on you. However, she\u2019s probably not strong enough to find you if you the city. By then her mother and maybe even I will have convinced her to embrace her powers.\u201d\n\nYou start to say something, but Mr. Reynolds stops you and also grabs your wrist tightly. So tight that it almost feels like he\u2019s going to crush your bones.\n\n\u201cYOU are NOT going to stop this son. Take solace in the fact that you NEVER had a choice.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says in a low firm voice.\n\nMr. Reynolds is giving off an aura that puts you completely on the edge terror. This isn\u2019t just a normal threat. You\u2019re seeing something new. Something less human, less mortal even. A faint scent also hits your nose, it\u2019s brimstone.\n\nStill despite all this, you do have real feelings for Madeline. Maybe it\u2019s because you left Annah when she was in trouble that you don\u2019t want to do the same thing to Madeline. At the very least, you want to be able to give HER the choice.\n\n\u201cMr. Reynolds\u2026I love your daughter. I can\u2019t just take off and leave without at least presenting my side to her.\u201d You say, mustering all your courage, which causes a smile from Mr. Reynolds.\n\n\u201cFair enough, I can respect that, but let me ask you this\u2026are you REALLY willing to go through hell for her son? Now I want you to think VERY carefully before answering. Because IF you are willing to go all in on proving how much you actually do love my daughter, then I need that answer now.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes", "result": "No soon have you said yes, when Mr. Reynolds closed smile becomes a disturbing toothy grin.\n\n\u201cThank you son. You just made convincing her much easier.\u201d Mr. Reynolds says and then suddenly touches your chest and you feel like your heart has a hot knife going into it. It might as well have because you feel like death is approaching you quickly as your body begins to seize up. You can\u2019t even cry out.\n\nMr. Reynolds sits you up in your chair and draws attention away from any possible onlookers by sitting you up in your chair so your body just slouches on it without falling. He then makes some out loud comment about you being really tired today and to just rest your eyes a bit if you need to.\n\nAs this is all happening you just stare the stage where some old guy is talking at a podium. struggling to keep your eyes open.\n\nAs the graduates are called on stage, your mind begins to get foggy and your lids get even heavier. You manage to just barely see Madeline accept her diploma before everything goes black.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long everything is black for, but it\u2019s a long time.\n\nEventually you wake up.\n\nFirst thing you notice is you\u2019re stark naked, laying on a bed and it\u2019s incredibly hot. The room you\u2019re in is fairly nice, so you have to be someplace upscale.\n\nWhen you try to get up however, you find that you can\u2019t move. You\u2019re not being held down by anything either. It\u2019s more of a force holding you down. This doesn\u2019t fill you with confidence that your situation has improved.\n\nAs you struggle, the door to the room is suddenly opened and there you see her. Madeline.\n\nBut she\u2019s different now. She\u2019s naked as well for one thing and while you\u2019ve seen her in that state many times, you\u2019ve never seen her skin with a red hue before. One might even say crimson color.\n\nShe also notice she has little horns protruding from her head. Barely noticeable, but there none the less.\n\nYou have a sinking feeling that things just got even worse\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re finally awake I was hoping you would soon.\u201d\n\u201cMadeline\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in our new house! Do you like the room? If not, we can always change it up for you.\u201d\n\u201cHouse? Look, your father\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, he told me. He told me everything. I always knew you loved me! And now that you\u2019re conscious again, we can have a bit of fun. And I need to have some fun right now.\u201d Madeline says and rushes over to lie next to you in the bed and kisses you. You suddenly feel the force holding you down lifted.\n\nWhile this would be great any other time, you\u2019re still concerned about you situation.\n\n\u201cMadeline, I REALLY need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, can we not talk about that right now? You don\u2019t really want to know anyway.\u201d Madeline responds.\n\u201cMadeline\u2026please. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nMadeline almost looks a bit sad when you insist, but she tells you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead baby.\u201d Madeline remarks while stroking your face.\n\u201cI\u2019m dead?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re in the infernal realm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in fucking hell?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it could be worse! I mean you\u2019re with me!\u201d\n\nMadeline realizes that she might need to give you a fuller explanation so she proceeds to do so.\n\nShe tells you that her father killed and collected your soul. She says he doesn\u2019t do that often because it requires a lot of energy for him to do so mainly because he\u2019s not a full blood demon, but he felt this was an important occasion.\n\nShe then says right after she graduated her mother approached her and how strange that event was. The funnier thing she said though is she didn\u2019t completely disbelieve her mother\u2019s story when she heard it as she always felt like there was something more to her life.\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t something she wanted to necessarily embrace, so for the next few days it was nothing but arguments with her and her new found demonic mother. Meanwhile her father was preparing your soul to present to her. Madeline still didn\u2019t even know you were dead at this time.\n\nBy the time her father showed up, she was ready to run off but then he presented your soul to her. He said he would only give it to her if she embraced her demonic heritage and return home. He then of course told her what you said to him and if it was a choice between disobeying and saving your soul from eternal torment, her choice was easy.\n\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d you say.\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Madeline says.\n\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for me, you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026I wouldn\u2019t bet on all that. I may have eventually come here anyway\u2026I mean I was wondering what I was going to do after graduation\u2026hey did you know besides slowly embracing my heritage, they wanted me to help oversee the building of a new pain tower? I\u2019m getting to use what I learned!\u201d Madeline beams.\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026you\u2019re here, you\u2019re mine and you\u2019re safe\u2026as long as you stay in this room. But you get to be with me, isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\n\nYou look at Madeline and your eyes gaze all over her naked body, this followed by your hands wandering. Madeline giggles a bit and touches you as well.\n\n\u201cWell, okay here and now. Yeah, that\u2019s definitely enough. But\u2026I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going to happen as time goes on. I mean you\u2019re a demon so I assume you\u2019re immortal on some level and I\u2019m dead and here in soul form or whatever it is. I mean this is forever. How long before you get tired of me? Will you eventually discard the last remnants of your humanity and just throw me in a pain tower or something as soon as I anger you in some way? I mean how much time to we really have? Should I prepare myself for the inevitable?\u201d\n\nMadeline\u2019s face gets sad again, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t want to think about that. Despite the new horns she\u2019s very much still hanging on to most of her human emotions for you. She sits up and starts to sniffle a bit.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Are you trying to upset her and shorten your relative paradise? Just go with it, stupid!\u201d you think to yourself.\n\nYou sit up and caress Madeline\u2019s shoulders and back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s not worry about it. I said I\u2019d go through hell for you\u2026and well here I am and I love you for saving my soul.\u201d You say and then lean in and turn Madeline\u2019s head to kiss her on the lips.\n\nAs Madeline and you embrace, you think about how your actions lead you to this fate.\n\nYou might be running on borrowed time, but you might as well enjoy it, because not many are in your privileged position in the infernal realm.\n\nWhatever lies in store for you, your life as a rogue has definitely ended.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "No", "result": "You realize what Mr. Reynolds is trying to do.

I can respect that too. But if your answer is no then you will be leaving after all and I don\u2019t think I need to explain why. Madeline\u2019s mother isn\u2019t as nice as I am.\u201d\n\nThis is a shitty situation. You don\u2019t want to leave Madeline, but you also don\u2019t want to be on the wrong end of a bunch of violent demons. You aren\u2019t equipped to handle it even with the resources you have at your disposal and you question if any of them would be of any real help if it came down to it anyway. (Besides Vaughn maybe)\n\nTo top everything off, you now have to abandon what you got going on here!\n\nYou wish you had listened to Zalmora.\n\nYou don\u2019t say any more and just get up to leave. As you\u2019re doing this, you make one last glance back at the stage and there you see Madeline accepting her diploma with a big smile. She has no idea what is in store for her.\n\nYou manage to catch a buggy back to the slums of Klyton and from there you make your way back to headquarters.\n\nThe first thing you do is start opening your safes and hauling out the most precious valuables along with a good stack of gold coins.\n\n\u201cHey boss, I saw you come back. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Vaughn suddenly asks walking in you.\n\u201cVaughn, this is your lucky day. You\u2019re inheriting everything and it required absolutely no effort on your part other than being more competent than every other Crimson Talon here.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAs of right now Vaughn, you\u2019re head of the Crimson Talons. Good luck.\u201d\n\u201cI am? Wait. Where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cMe? I have no idea, but I\u2019m going far away. I won\u2019t be coming back either.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Is the militia on your ass? Should I be worried?\u201d\n\u201cHah. The militia. If only it was that simple. No, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but no you shouldn\u2019t be worried. However, if Madeline comes by tell her\u2026tell her that I didn\u2019t have a choice and to move on. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay. So this is goodbye then\u2026(sigh) I have to say it\u2019s starting to get pretty lonely here what with all of the old gang gone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get by. Bye Vaughn.\u201d\n\nWithout any more fanfare you leave the Crimson Talon headquarters wondering where to go.\n\nHolgard comes to mind, but there's always some sort of rebellion or power struggle going on there. You'd rather not have to deal with being in the middle of that mess. The Delantium Kingdom is at war with some other nation, so you'd rather avoid the possibility of suddenly getting press ganged or conscripted into military service.\n\nThe only other place that comes to mind is Hessla which for one thing is a whole lot closer, but it also still has a reputation of being a haven for thieves, pirates, and other criminal types. At least it\u2019s something you\u2019d be familiar with.\n\nSince you need to put as much distance between you and Klyton, you catch a carriage ride out to the infamous town. The trip to Hessla is surprisingly uneventful.\nYou half figured you'd at least run into a few idiots trying to rob you on the road, but happily you don\u2019t encounter any problems other than the overly talkative priest of Joachim who is traveling with you thinking that he\u2019s going to bring the light of Joachim to Hessla all by himself.\n\nWhen you finally get to Hessla, its actually a little nicer looking than you thought it was going to look. You expected it to be filled with run down homes with unsavory types located on every corner. If anything, the town has locations that are fancier looking than some of the better parts of Klyton.\n\nAfter spending a few days in Hessla you also learn that this place really isn't as disorderly as it's reputation would imply. Granted it's far from being as repressive as Klyton, but there actually is a \"force\" that makes sure it isn't a free for all. The Hessla Headsmen report directly to the governor who apparently is an ex-pirate that controls everything in town.\n\nIf anything the crime is less than one might think mainly because most are pirates and pillaging other places rather than here. You are surprisingly finding the place a bit easy on the pick pocket and theft front, of course a lot of folks are either half drunk or plain drunk most of the time. Also most folks don't seem to own that many personal belongings. You guess with most making their living at sea, they keep essentials on their ships, spend it all on booze and whores or otherwise live a very basic life, so despite you finding the town a bit easy pickings, you aren't getting rich doing it. Shops however are very well protected by the Headsmen since you guess Governor Tolen has a slice of all the businesses here.\n\nFights are pretty common, though they aren't necessarily always to the death like you'd expect. Just a lot of disagreement and drinking make for a rowdy town. So far you've avoided pissing anyone off and kept a low profile. At first you aren't sure if you're actually going to stay here for long or not, but on your fifth night you have another dream of Madeline.\n\nIn the dream she\u2019s very sad and wandering the streets of Klyton calling out and looking for you. You don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what she\u2019s actually doing in real life or you\u2019re just dreaming up the scenario, but needless to say you don\u2019t sleep very well.\n\nThe next morning you decide you need to get even further away. Like completely off the mainland. The problem is you have no idea what really lies across the water. You know pirates are raiding something because you\u2019ve heard the stories. Of course the problem with that is you\u2019re not looking for some place to just stop and plunder. You\u2019re looking for a place of relative civilization of where you can get your bearings before deciding what to do with the rest of your life as well as getting away from your demon spawn girlfriend.\n\nYou ask around and after exchanging a bit of coin, a Hessla merchant ship (They do exist contrary to popular belief) agrees to take you to Jicol. Apparently it\u2019s a city state on a fairly large island to the west. It\u2019s about the only place that Hessla pirates never fuck with due to the well-trained navy and the fact that Jicol has made it quite clear that any attack on their ships or city will result in total war with Hessla and it isn\u2019t one the pirate town would win.\n\nYou spend about a week getting to this new city. The third night aboard the ship, you have faint glimpses of Madeline\u2019s face in your dreams. At first you\u2019re concerned that you\u2019re never going to get far enough, but you have no more dreams for the rest of the trip.\n\nBy the time you get settled your first night in Jicol, your dreams are back to normal and you hope they stay that way.\n\nBrand new city.

No way I\u2019d give it to Swifty here.\u201d You say picking up your not so small rodent creature and petting him a couple times.\n\u201cHow come you don\u2019t enter him in the fights?

Occasionally dice and cards too, but Swifty is a sure thing. Never thought you\u2019d be a rodent racer, but here you are.\n\nStill, sometimes you wonder about your family. How your mother and father are doing and if their lives in Teckleville are better, worse or the same after events that occurred so long ago.\n\nYou also wonder about your sister and if she\u2019s still travelling or settled down. Probably not. She was always more of a wanderer at heart. Whatever she\u2019s doing you hope she\u2019s doing well.\n\nYou get to your humble abode and suddenly Swifty jumps off your shoulder and scurries away into a nearby crack in a wall.\n\n\u201cSwifty! Come here! Hey!\u201d you shout and go to the crack, but he\u2019s gone. You aren\u2019t too worried since he\u2019s run off like that before, but always comes back. He likes the Delantium cheese you give him too much to ever disappear for good.\n\nNot wishing to spend all night fumbling around in the dark outside looking for a rodent, you head inside your small home.\n\nNo sooner have you shut the door when you smell the air. It\u2019s like something is on fire. At first you think it\u2019s your home, but then you realize this isn\u2019t a normal fire smell.\n\nIt\u2019s brimstone.\n\nAnd then you see a pair of eyes in the darkness.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d you shout and go to get the door open, but you\u2019re suddenly pulled back by a clawed hand and slammed to the floor hard.\n\nYou desperately go for your flintlock, but that is smacked out of your grip by a tail that whips your hand. Your next attempt is your cutlass, but a cloven hoof puts an end to that attempt by stomping on your hand and breaking it.\n\nYou then feel a body drop on your chest and putting all the weight behind it. You cough and try to catch your breath and that\u2019s when you finally see what is attacking you.\n\nA red skinned female demonic form complete with horns, wings, a tail and cloven hooves straddles your chest.\n\nMadeline.\n\nWhile the rest of her has changed drastically, you\u2019d never forget her face.\n\n\u201cHello, lover.\u201d She hisses.\n\u201cMadeline\u2026didn\u2019t know you were coming\u2026\u201d you say struggling to breathe.\n\u201cI thought about visiting you in your dreams, but then I thought the personal touch would be much more satisfying.\u201d\n\u201cI can see how you would, but I can\u2019t say I do. Why the hell are you even here and obviously pissed at me?\u201d\n\u201cAfter what you did, you have the balls to ask me that? You fucking LEFT me. Left me with my asshole father and my long lost bitch of a mother! Left me with no explanation or even support!\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s not true. I told Vaughn to tell you to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMove on with my life and how you didn\u2019t have a choice. Fuck you. You DID have a choice. You could have stayed! We could have supported each other!\u201d\n\u201cNo! No we really couldn\u2019t have Madeline. Your father made it quite clear that if he didn\u2019t kill me, your mother sure as hell would have if I didn\u2019t leave. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious what the result would have been. I mean look at you, you\u2019ve obviously embraced your demonic heritage within only two years and I\u2019m NO fucking match for you.\u201d\n\nMadeline briefly looks down at her own body.\n\n\u201cYes, look at me. I\u2019m a daughter of hell, seducer and destroyer of men, yet I still have these pathetic feelings of love for you. I can\u2019t move on like you suggested. I can\u2019t deal with this separation.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d probably be more scared about what\u2019s going to come next, but the pain in your body is making fear a secondary concern and honestly you knew as soon as you didn\u2019t escape that it was probably all over.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026do you really have to Madeline? I mean I know it would be difficult, but I\u2019m willing to go back to the way things were with\u2026\u201d you start to say before you get a punch to your face. It feels like being hit by a piece of steel, but immediately after Madeline goes in to kiss you and even cries a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry\u2026but this is the way it has to be\u2026I loved you and you abandoned me. We can\u2019t go back to the way things were. (Sniffle) But I do know how to make things right.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Madeline starts stripping off your clothing. You\u2019re really not in any condition to stop her, though you do try to feebly get away once. (Which results in another punch) Madeline being a succubus easily manages to get you \u201cready\u201d and then positions herself on top of your dick and begins to grind against you.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t anything pleasurable about any of this, especially how hard Madeline is riding you, tightly squeezing your arms and making unnatural noises the whole time. You also feel like your dick is on fire the entire time. The only thing you can do is hope it ends quickly, which fortunately it does and you soon release.\n\nAfterwards, Madeline then suddenly becomes \u201cgentle\u201d and for a brief moment lies on top of your body.\n\n\u201cOur baby is going to be how I remember the good times with you and I\u2019m going to be an attentive mother no matter what.\u201d She whispers in your ear.\n\u201cMad\u2026\u201d you start to utter before she puts a talon to your lips.\n\u201cGoodbye my love.\u201d She says sadly and then with a quick strike of her finger she rips your throat open and licks your blood as you bleed out.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Dispose of Madeline", "result": "This isn\u2019t the work of someone with just a crush. This is obviously an obsession and the fact she got the goblins to do it, means she\u2019s not just crazy she\u2019s dangerous and that\u2019s a bad combination.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be able to reason with her. She\u2019s already proven she\u2019s beyond that. Dismissing her isn\u2019t going to work either. Not to mention she killed one of your productive members. Sure he was an idiot when it came to picking women obviously, but he still did his job and excelled in that area.\n\nShe\u2019s going to have to be dealt with in a more permanent manner.\n\n\u201cZal, Vaughn, come on. We\u2019re going to deal with this crazy bitch and I want you both with me in case she gets ideas to sic her goblin buddies on me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait, do we need to kill her? I mean isn\u2019t she important?\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cShe might come from money, but her daddy isn\u2019t on the council. At best the militia might do an investigation, but they aren\u2019t going to find her.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou sure we\u2019re going to be enough? Should we bring some more guys? There are a lot more goblins than us.\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll grab a couple more Talons on the way out, but we\u2019re not going to be bushwacked like Camid and I know we\u2019re much better fighters. As soon as we kill a few of those green buggers they\u2019ll probably start running away. We\u2019ll be fine. Now let\u2019s get this shit done.\u201d You say.\n\nYou and your \u201chit squad\u201d head over to the new headquarters dig site. You remember Madeline was doing her overseeing there today.\n\nAfter entering and walking through several empty rooms and corridors, you find Madeline by herself, just sitting on the ground. She doesn\u2019t get up, she just looks down at the ground. There aren\u2019t any goblins around though, which is strange.\n\n\u201cHey. I guess you figured out what happened.\u201d Madeline says.\n\u201cDamn right I did. Did you really think you were going to get away with it? Did you really think that was going to work?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I had hope and I had to try. Stupid I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou got that one right too, school girl.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your goblin friends?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI sent them away as soon as they told me you were coming. I didn\u2019t want them to get hurt. It wasn\u2019t their fault after all.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t their fault? Some of them were the ones who killed Camid!\u201d you exclaim and move towards Madeline, but Zal holds you back.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. What do you mean you sent them away when they told you were coming? How did they even know, we haven\u2019t seen any of them.\u201d Zal asks.\n\nMadeline looks up and stands.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t just dig a tunnel into the Yellow Devil Den. They\u2019ve dug tunnels all over the sewers. Mostly under them. Made it easier for them to get around without having to walk about in the actual sewers. They may have also dug some tunnels near your old head quarters\u2026you know, you look very peaceful when you sleep\u2026\u201d Madeline says looking directly at you.\n\nYou and everyone else takes a step back. You\u2019re actually a little creeped out now and a lot more concerned.\n\n\u201cEveryone, prepare for an ambush!\u201d you say and you all form a circle expecting goblins to pop up out of secret compartments in the floor and walls.\n\n\u201cI told you I sent them away. They isn\u2019t going to be some big fight. There isn\u2019t going to be a fight at all. This is the end. I wish you could have loved me, the way I love you, but at least we\u2019ll die together, and I guess that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nAt this point you hear an explosion outside the new headquarter\u2019s entrance. It isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s enough to cause a rumbling and the ceiling of starts to fall to pieces. Vaughn, Zal and the other two Talons instantly run back to the entrance only to find that\u2019s its collapsed and soon so will the rest of this place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how with one well place bundle of explosive power can make an otherwise stable structure fall completely apart. I\u2019ll certainly miss finishing my education.\u201d Madeline says in almost a monotone way.\n\nAs the rest of your cohorts run around desperately trying to get out of this death trap, you do the only thing you want to do and that\u2019s plunge your sword into Madeline. She puts up no resistance and just touches your face before falling to the ground.\n\nAs the clods of dirt and rocks begin to bury you and yours, all you can do is curse loudly to whatever gods may be listening before you are silenced forever.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Hire Scales", "result": "You must have lost your mind, because you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually considering this.\n\n\u201cFuck it, give me that egg.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Tom asks.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m serious. I know enough about Mr. Reynolds through my dad that I don\u2019t want to have deal with him. And as you said, he\u2019s probably going to have some sort of weird catch as part of the agreement he isn\u2019t going to reveal until afterwards. At least with the lizard I\u2019ll know where I stand right away.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it. Okay kid, I\u2019ll get that egg.\u201d\n\nTom heads over to one of his safes and after unlocking it, he takes out two green pieces of an oval shaped object, which he then puts together and hands to you. The broken egg is rough to the touch and more solid than you thought it would be.\n\n\u201cWhile this isn\u2019t as delicate as one might think, still be careful with it. You sure about this? I mean I still don\u2019t think this thing with Jake is that serious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be taken care of and besides, maybe I\u2019ll just be charming enough to convince Scales to join us again.\u201d\n\u201cYou think big kid, just hope you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nTom proceeds to tell you where he thinks Scales makes his home. It actually isn\u2019t too far from the forgotten sewer entrance. Tom goes on to say it might be dangerous just getting to Scales, since that part of the sewers has been non-functional and abandoned for as long as he can remember.\n\nArmed with this knowledge (And a broken egg) Tom wishes you luck before you leave.\n\nOn your way out, you\u2019re stopped by Zalmora and Vaughn.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Wait, is that an egg?\u201d Vaughn asks.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to use it to try to convince Scales to assassinate Jake. Tom said Ed used to do it all the time.\u201d You reply.\n\nVaughn\u2019s jaw almost drops and expresses obvious disbelief.\n\n\u201cHave you gone completely barmy? I wasn\u2019t here that long while Scales was still around, but even I know damn well that the only reason why Ed even had control over that lizard is because he raised him from that egg! And you can see that didn\u2019t work forever. You go looking for Scales and you\u2019re going to find death!\u201d Vaughn exclaims.\n\u201cWhy do we need Scales to assassinate Jake anyway? I mean I told you that I think it\u2019s a better idea to just let Jake continue rampaging through the woods to take the heat off of us.\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a good idea to just let disobedience within the organization to go unpunished like that. Besides, I also thought that given this Scale\u2019s reputation, maybe we could get him to join again.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYep, completely barmy.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cI agree\u2026but the idea does have some merit. If we did get Scales back, we\u2019d be in a lot better shape, muscle wise at least.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\nVaughn at this point just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cOkay, I can see this craziness is catching. I\u2019m leaving before I catch it too. See you later, assuming Scales doesn\u2019t eat you, and Zal, I would think that you\u2019d know better than to even entertain this idea.\u201d Vaughn remarks and walks away.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026are you coming with me?\u201d you ask Zalmora.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that actually. I just said your idea has some merit. It\u2019s at least thinking in the long term. Scales could certainly track down Jake and kill him. I would imagine he\u2019d also scare everyone else into coming back or even better a return to following the original plan of sending the spoils of their activities to us on a regular schedule.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cYou still really think our organization split up on the outside and inside the city is the best solution?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I really do believe that and I gave my reasons already.\u201d\n\nWhile she hasn\u2019t offered to go, you get the impression Zal might be more inclined to help you if support her idea, but if Zal wants to help she can come with you with you needing to ask her. You\u2019re not going to barter with her or be some pawn just because you\u2019re sleeping together every once in awhile.\n\n\u201cWell I guess I better head out.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Right. Don\u2019t let me keep you. Just remember, Scales has never been a friendly sort and probably the best way to handle him is to defer to him as the alpha. If he thinks you\u2019re a threat, he\u2019s going to react accordingly. Then again, if he thinks you\u2019re too weak, he might just eat you, but I\u2019m guessing not acting aggressively might help. Anyway, if you even think you\u2019re in grave danger, just get the hell out of there. Be careful okay?\u201d Zal says and starts to leave, but before she does she kisses you goodbye.\n\nThat sort of makes you feel more worried than you were before.\n\nYou leave the Crimson Talon headquarters and enter the sewers. You never cease hating stomping around down here, but possibly stepping in shit or worse is the least of your concerns right now.\n\nYou follow the directions Tom gave you and finally get to the abandoned part of the sewers he mentioned. Actually it doesn\u2019t even look like the rest of the sewers at this point. The tunnel is partially collapsed or has great gaping holes leading to who the hell knows where. Beyond this first tunnel, you can only imagine that it\u2019s going to be in even worse repair.\n\nUsing your lantern and your natural agility you continue to make your way, hopping that all this hoping and jumping around isn\u2019t going to break the egg in your pack any more than it already is.\n\nYou go through a couple more old collapsed sewer tunnels and then you notice the man made structure is starting to disappear into a crumbling abyss. You also notice how weak the ground (or rather what\u2019s left of it) is in general. One wrong move and you\u2019re probably falling to your death. You cautiously move across what\u2019s left the stone flooring.\n\nYou\u2019re doing pretty well until you suddenly hear some noise behind you. At first you think it\u2019s something sinister lurking down here or possibly even Scales himself, but when you hear the word \u201cShit!\u201d you know the voice immediately and turn around thrusting your lantern ahead.\n\n\u201cZal?!\u201d you call out.\n\nYour light illuminates enough that you can see a figure far behind you half hanging over the edge of the abyss. She doesn\u2019t answer she\u2019s just struggling to get back up.\n\n\u201cZal! What the fuck are you doing here?! Wait! I\u2019ll come help you!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cNo! You stay over there! This fucking floor is weak enough without both of us in the same area.\u201d\n\u201cZal, you\u2019re gonna fall!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m almost back up, just keep going!

At least on the job you have the necessary skills to pull it off. This is more like a roll of the dice. Not to mention, YOU haven\u2019t even met Scales. If he sees you, he\u2019s likely to just assume you\u2019re an interloper. At least he knows me. Though I\u2019m not sure if he liked, disliked or was indifferent to me. Never could tell what that lizard was thinking in the short time I knew him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the egg?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well let\u2019s hope that\u2019s enough for him not to kill us.\u201d\n\nYou and Zal proceed into the natural cavern. After walking a bit, you make a remark that all of this might be pointless anyway and you might just head back because it wasn\u2019t your intention on getting lost in a system of underground tunnels.\n\nZal doesn\u2019t really argue, but she does ask what you\u2019re going to do about an assassin though. Just as you\u2019re about to answer, you hear a faint noise, which is enough to put you on edge because it\u2019s been eerily quiet down here.\n\n\u201cYou hear\u2026ulp!\u201d Zal says and then before your eyes a scaled green claw covers her mouth and another holds a dagger to her throat. You also notice a long tail wrapped around one of her legs and a pair of glinting reptilian eyes shine behind her.\n\n\u201cNO! WAIT! SCALES! I have something for you! Don\u2019t kill her!\u201d you shout and take off your pack in haste while still trying to eye on Zal who looks like she\u2019s trying to remain as calm as she can under the circumstances.\n\nYou pull out the two large pieces of the egg and then hold them out.\n\nScales\u2019 moves forward a bit with Zal still in his clutches. His eyes briefly stare at the egg and then fixate on you again. You can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s angry or what, all you do know is his stare doesn\u2019t put you at ease.\n\nSuddenly, Scales slashes Zal\u2019s neck open and throws her body aside like a rag doll and before you can even shout out he\u2019s grabbed your hands causing the egg pieces to fall to the ground.\n\nAs you feel the claws dig into your flesh and Scales give you the predatory stare, all you can think about is how Zal is dead, but you also realize if you\u2019re going to get out of this alive, you\u2019re going to have to continue to talk because it\u2019s very obvious that you\u2019re not fighting your way out of this or running.\n\n\u201cScales! Please, all we wanted to do is return this egg to you. Edmond is dead. We weren\u2019t following his orders or anything like that. We were going to ask for help, but it\u2019s obvious that you want to be alone. I will go back and never bother you again. You have my word.\u201d\n\nScales briefly looks down at the egg pieces and then back to you. His head turns a bit as if he\u2019s studying you, then his grip on your hands releases, allowing you to slowly pull them back towards your body.\n\nScales then crouches down and starts inspecting the egg pieces. You take this as an opportunity to leave and you back away into the darkness, not even taking your lantern. You have no idea how the hell you\u2019re going to safely cross back over that crumbling walkway, but that\u2019s going to have to be another struggle for later.\n\nYou turn around and as quick as you can in the darkness put some distance between you and Scales. You don\u2019t look back, though you soon find that you don\u2019t need to because you hear a noise followed by a great whipping force hitting one of your legs which takes you off your feet.\n\nYou hit the ground, but you don\u2019t stay there for long because clawed hands soon pick you up. You struggle for one of your daggers, but this is met by what you can only imagine are teeth sinking into your arm. You scream out as Scales sharp teeth not only rip your flesh, but also break bone.\n\nYou are thrown to the ground again and then Scales pounces on top of you. You can only see his eyes in this darkness, but it\u2019s the last thing you\u2019re ever going to see.\n\n\u201cThank you warm blood, but can\u2019t let you leave. Might bring othersss.

I\u2019ll inform her\u2026I have to ask though. How come you don\u2019t like Zal?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s an underhanded manipulator.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just get rid of her then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t deny her skills as a thief and she\u2019s very capable in that regard. The fact is, she wants more power, but for whatever reason she doesn\u2019t want the actual position of being the boss. I assume it\u2019s because then she\u2019d actually have a target on her back. No, much safer to just stand in the shadows and criticize and play mini-puppeteer\u2026sort of like what she\u2019s doing with you.\u201d\n\u201cZal is not manipulating me.\u201d\n\u201cOh no? You don\u2019t think that this little idea that you came up with isn\u2019t some shit she whispered in your ear? Contrary to popular belief around here, I\u2019m not the damn fool people seem to think I am. You don\u2019t think she hasn\u2019t tried her little feminine wiles on me long before you showed up and got me out that cage? So since this is probably all her idea, SHE can be the one to do it!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen Tom quite so angry before, or at least extremely annoyed. Not wishing for this to get worse, you back away and leave Tom\u2019s office.\n\nYou soon meet up with Zal.\n\n\u201cSo, how did it go with Tom?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cHe says he wants you to go talk with Jake and making a formal split about there being no hard feelings and such.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm. I see. And you\u2019re not going to be there at all?\u201d\n\u201cTom says he wants me here. Says you\u2019d be better for the job seeing as you have a past with Jake and how he hates me.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose I can see the logic in that. (Sigh) Very well, I suppose I can do it. I guess it was sort of my idea in the first place. Guess I better get that old bottle of absinium. Jake\u2019s gonna want a peace offering\u2026and probably something else. Just hope he doesn\u2019t pass out like he always does. Ugh.\u201d\n\u201cZal, you shouldn\u2019t have to go do this if you don\u2019t want to. Why don\u2019t I go instead or we can go together?\u201d\n\nZal smiles at you and pats you on the face a couple times.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet dear, but if you show up there by yourself, Jake\u2019s gonna kill you. If he see both of us there together, he\u2019ll probably do worse than kill you. And more importantly he could even kill me, so no you\u2019re not going. For once Tom made the right decision even if he\u2019s hoping I probably get killed in the process.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cTom said some pretty interesting things about you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he did and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m sure you can make up your own mind about me. I\u2019m off.\u201d\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t you need to know where Jake even is?\u201d\n\u201cI know the general area of where he\u2019s probably located and I know Jake. He\u2019s not going to be hard to find for me. See you later maybe.\u201d\n\nAnd with those last words, Zalmora takes her leave of you presumably to go gather a few more items before heading out to seek Jake.\n\nYou have some mixed feelings about all this, but really this is probably the best way to handle all this.\n\nWith that plan in motion, it\u2019s business as usual in the organization.\n\nA week passes and there still isn\u2019t any word from Zal. No word from Jake or anyone from the Bloody Smiles either.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t certain that Zal was successful and just stayed or she was killed, what is certain is that enough time has passed that it\u2019s pretty clear that the Bloody Smiles are no longer sending anything back to the Crimson Talons. A \u201cclean break\u201d or not, Jake has gone his own way.\n\nTom doesn\u2019t seem to care about it anymore. He\u2019s not exactly happy, but he seems to have an \u201coh well\u201d approach and isn\u2019t concerning himself with the situation any longer.\n\nAlmost everyone else in the organization has some thoughts on the matter and most of them aren\u2019t good.\n\nA lot of folks are just planning to go find Jake and follow him instead, a few have just mentioned going independent. Still others have mentioned maybe it\u2019s time for new leadership within the Crimson Talons.\n\nYou\u2019re more in favor of ousting Tom. After all you\u2019ve been putting most of the major effort into this organization, while Tom doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit at all and you don\u2019t see why he should be running things if that\u2019s the case.\n\nNot to mention, he\u2019s the one that sucks, why should you leave?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before you, Vaughn and a few others confront Tom in his office. He\u2019s pretty surprised.\n\n\u201cUm, has something come up?\u201d Tom asks.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re stepping down as head of Crimson Talons. You\u2019re no longer fit to lead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, is that right? And who is? You?\u201d\n\u201cThis organization could do worse.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cPfft, not much worse.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cWhy are we still talking, let\u2019s just gut this old asshole and get on with it.\u201d Camid, one of the younger members shouts.\n\u201cGut him? I thought we were just removing him from power.\u201d Vaughn remarks.\n\u201cWell how the hell did you think we were going to do that Vaughn? We can\u2019t just let this asshole walk away! That\u2019s what HE did with Jake and the rest! And that\u2019s why he\u2019s a pussy leader. We do the same thing and we\u2019re pussies too!\u201d Camid remarks.\n\u201cJust because the man\u2019s a pussy doesn\u2019t mean we need to kill the guy.\u201d\n\u201cOh big surprise coming from someone who takes dick like a pussy.\u201d Camid shouts.\n\nVaughn\u2019s temper at this point starts to rise at Camid\u2019s remark and now those two are nearly coming to blows.\n\nWhile you\u2019re telling them to shut the hell up and focus, you notice that Tom is getting something out of his desk. It\u2019s probably going to be a flintlock pistol.\n\nWasting no time, you leap halfway across Tom\u2019s desk in an effort to stop him from pulling out a pistol. You were correct as you manage to grab his hand in the drawer and indeed see it grabbing a pistol.\n\n\u201cLet it fucking go!\u201d you say.\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Tom shouts, but instead of struggling for the pistol he instead grabs a sharp quill off his desk and stabs you deep in the eye with it.\n\nYou scream in agony and roll off the desk clutching you face. Despite the pain and the screaming, you manage to pull the quill out of your destroyed eyeball, which makes a sickening squishy sound. Blood leaks out on your face.\n\nBy this time however, Tom has gained complete control over the situation and everyone else who was rebelling have stopped doing whatever they were doing and stepped back.\n\n\u201cYou fuckers think you can take over? You assholes can\u2019t even get along with each other! And you, I actually liked you kid, but I can see that I was severely wrong on that front. Y\u2019know if you weren\u2019t happy here, you could have just left. I\u2019ve never held anyone here against their will. But no you had to try this shit, well that ain\u2019t happening and now you have to pay. I\u2019m the fucking boss around here and you\u2019re the example.\u201d\n\nAnd with those last words, Tom makes you an example by shooting you in the other eye. This time the wound is fatal.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Stay independent", "result": "Staying with the Crimson Talons, just seems like a bunch of trouble waiting to happen. They\u2019re disorganized, their new leader is some guy that YOU had to rescue, they\u2019re obviously on the hit list of the authorities here and you aren\u2019t getting the impression that they\u2019re going to be your style.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 Tom I appreciate the offer, but I think I\u2019m going to stay on my own.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI figured. Can\u2019t really blame you, though I am disappointed since I think not only would you be an asset, but I think you might have learned a few things yourself. It might not seem like it, but some of the folks here are pretty good at their craft.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well maybe another time\u2026so we\u2019re good I trust?\u201d\n\u201cYeah we\u2019re good\u2026actually here\u2019s something for your rescue effort. It would be more, but well as you can see, a bit down on fortune at the moment.\u201d Tom says handing you a few gold coins from a pouch.\n\nTom at this point walks with you to entrance back to the sewer where he gives you directions to the next closest exit to the city streets from there. He then mentions a few cheap inns in the area you should end up in.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t think I need to tell you, that I\u2019d like to keep our hideout a secret.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cSure, secret\u2019s safe with me. Not like I got anyone to tell anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019m sure you realize that it would be bad for you if you did rat on us to anyone.\u201d Tom says in a tone that\u2019s slightly more hostile than he\u2019s been towards you.\n\u201cHey, I ain\u2019t no rat.\u201d You proclaim.\n\u201cOf course not. Well good luck kid, wherever your endeavors take you.\u201d Tom says and with that you exit the hideout and the door slams behind you leaving you back in the sewers.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Back in the shit. Well at least I\u2019m a little richer this time. Okay, I think he said this way\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd so begins your life in Klyton...", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 2B: The More Things Change\n\n\n\nYear 17\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, here\u2019s the rent.\u201d You say handing over a few silvers to Trobart.\n\nThe innkeeper takes the silver and gives you a scornful look.\n\n\u201cBout fucking time! You\u2019re always late! And don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how you get this!\u201d Trobart says.\n\u201cOf course you know how I get this, but it doesn\u2019t stop you from taking the money anyway, you mean old bastard.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWatch yer, fuckin\u2019 tongue! One word from me, and the militia would take your ass in quick!\u201d\n\u201cPfft, yeah right. You call the militia and they\u2019d probably shut this whole place down. You\u2019re selling booze without a license in the basement and one of your rooms is being used by an unlicensed whore.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you cunt face!\u201d Trobart shouts and stomps off. You just shake your head at the old man\u2019s misplaced anger.\n\nYou head to your room with no more distractions, and then wearily sit on your shitty straw mattress and count what\u2019s left of your ill-gotten loot. Enough to eat for a few days.\n\nGranted this hasn\u2019t been the best month, but you swear you thought you\u2019d be doing a lot better than this by now. This city unfortunately though is proving a lot more vigilant than you\u2019d like. You certainly aren\u2019t in Teckleville anymore.\n\nWhat\u2019s really not helping is the Crimson Talons running around carelessly committing clumsy burglaries and heists and bringing the militia down even harder on everything.\n\nYou\u2019re sort of glad you didn\u2019t join up with them now, because at this rate, the militia is probably going to track them down and execute the lot of them.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t solve your current problem.\n\nPart of you wonders if maybe you should just move on from this city, but you really loathe the idea of travelling again and you aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019d go. Hessla maybe?\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering your possible future here, you get a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cHeeeeey youngster! (hic!) You got any spare\u2026.coppers fer the faith?\u201d\n\nGreat, it\u2019s that drunken priest that has a room across from you. You thought the men of Joachim were supposed to be into purity and restraint. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d think Joachim was the god of alcohol and hopeless drunks based on this guy\u2019s behavior and actions.\n\n\u201cNo and I told you to stop bothering me Virgil! Don\u2019t you have a collection box you can pilfer booze money from?\u201d you shout.\n\u201cYeah\u2026but no\u2026but I got some (hic) news\u2026\u201d Virgil answers.\n\u201cYeah, I already know about Joachim\u2019s blessed light. You tried to tell me about it the first time I came here and you nearly threw up on me in the process.\u201d\n\u201cI did? Geez, sorry son\u2026but this is different! (hic) Some\u2026somebody\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomebody what?\u201d\n\u201cSomebody was lookin\u2019 fer ya.\u201d\n\nWell that peaked your interest.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cYeah\u2026(hic).\u201d\n\u201cHold on.\u201d You say and go answer the door.\n\nNo sooner have you opened the door when the odor of Virgil hits you full force. You immediately cover your nose and mouth.\n\n\u201cShit, Virgil. When the hell was the last time you washed? You fucking smell worse than a troll\u2019s ass. Granted I\u2019ve never smelled a troll\u2019s ass, but I think it\u2019s a safe bet you smell worse than one.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGuess again. Hahahahahahaha! (hic) So can ya spare a copper?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, so what\u2019s all this about someone looking for me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that. Yeah, this big guy. I mean not like ogre big, but just human big ya know? Old guy too. (hic) I mean not as old as that asshole who own this place, but probably around my age.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s still fucking old then, aren\u2019t you like seventy?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you. I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m in my forties\u2026I think\u2026yeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so big guy in his forties was looking for me. What did he want?\u201d\n\nOf course NOW Virgil decides to be uncooperative.\n\n\u201cNo! No! Fuck you, I\u2019m not tellin\u2019 you shit now. (hic) Who\u2026who\u2026what do you think I am some kinda asshole fer you to abuse? Callin\u2019 me seventy fuckin\u2019 years old. I oughta kick yer ass in the name of Joachim! Yer lucky I\u2019m a man of faith\u2026(hic)\u201d\n\nAt this point Virgil mumbles and stumbles away, bumps into the door to his room and then after a few tries he finally gets it open and slams it behind him.\n\nYou suppose you could always ask him again later when he\u2019s feeling less feisty. He will have likely forgotten all about your so-called insult later, of course he probably will have forgotten about the guy looking for you too.\n\nYou close the door and think on who he could have been talking about. Your dad? Dad\u2019s not a big guy though and you honestly doubt if he would bother to come look for you.\n\nMaybe it was Tom from the Crimson Talons? You can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d want to see you directly for though. You\u2019d imagine if he were trying to recruit you again he\u2019d send an underling to invite you to see him. Tom wasn\u2019t a huge guy either; of course given that Virgil is on the short and scrawny side, he probably thinks you\u2019re a big guy too.\n\nOther than those two, you\u2019re drawing a blank. It\u2019s a little concerning that some big guy is looking for you though.\n\nYou hear another knock on the door.\n\n\u201cVirgil?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s Randi. I got some information that you might want to know.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice says\n\nRandi is the red headed whore that lives down the hall. Unusual that she\u2019d seek you out, since she\u2019s snotty with you at the best of times. You guess it\u2019s because you turned down her overly aggressive offer the first time you stepped into this inn.\n\nYou answer the door and she\u2019s as scuzzy as ever. You feel like you\u2019re catching something just by standing this close to her.\n\n\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s this information? Because if it\u2019s some big guy that was looking for me, I already know because Virgil told me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Well did he tell you what this big guy wanted too?\u201d Randi asks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to know then.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Well?\u201d\n\u201cWell what?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I know you\u2019re not used to hearing this, but spit it out! Tell me what this guy wanted.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your fucking secretary. You want to know, you need to pay, ten silvers.\u201d\n\u201cTen fucking silvers? You don\u2019t charge that much for a blowjob!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well if you want a blowjob, then you can pay half that price, but if you want to know what that guy wanted, it\u2019s ten silvers.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re wondering who this guy is and why he\u2019s looking for you, you\u2019re not exactly keen on giving away most of your hard earned money to some whore who you\u2019re not even fucking.\n\n\u201cYeah well go find two dicks to suck then, because you\u2019re not getting ten silver from me.\u201d You say and shut the door on Randi who shouts some obscenities at you from the hallway.\n\nYou\u2019ll just remain alert and keep an eye out this guy looking for you. Remain on your guard too, since you still don\u2019t know if this man means you harm or not. Hopefully Virgil can tell you something later. You might have to offer a couple coppers, but it\u2019s far cry from ten silvers.\n\nFor now though you decide to get some sleep after your long night of thievery. As your lids get heavier, you think on where you could ply your trade with a little more ease and a lot more loot. The rich areas are well patrolled, the government district is well patrolled, the merchant district is well patrolled, and the poor areas are\u2026still patrolled and the folks don\u2019t have shit.\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you that you\u2019ve never really tried the university district of the city. Might be worth a look, after all it should be filled with stupid rich kids not aware of their surroundings and the Talons don\u2019t seem to go running around there, so there might be less heat.\n\nLater\u2026\n\nYou wake up midday. After getting yourself ready for today\u2019s endeavors, you knock on Virgil\u2019s door, but there is no answer. He\u2019s either still asleep or he\u2019s out collecting donations for Joachim. Probably the latter considering you didn\u2019t contribute to his booze fund.\n\nYou leave the Welcome Mat Inn, though a little more cautiously than usual. Nobody seems to be approaching or giving you suspicious looks though. Still, wishing to keep a low profile, you stick to the back streets as much as possible and eventually when you get to the better part of town, you catch a coach for your remaining trip to the university. By the time you arrive, the day is beginning to end, but you soon find that the university is still fairly active.\n\nAfter a few hours of just scouting and walking around, it\u2019s much like you figured. A lot of scholarly types with their noses in books and rich kids that do a lot of partying. The dorms have security, but oddly not as much as one might think.\n\nYou find that despite being dressed in your lower class clothing, nobody is really giving you a second glance. It might be due to your youth though; you probably just look like a struggling student. Wasn\u2019t like your dad was exactly rich when he attended this place either.\n\nIt occurs to you how strange it is to be at the university at all. You never thought you\u2019d ever \u201cattend\u201d your dad\u2019s old place of higher learning. You\u2019re sure at one time he had hopes you would, but it probably wasn\u2019t under these circumstances.\n\nOut of curiosity you pay a visit to the section to where the medical school is located. Seems weird that your father spent so much money and time putting himself through the place while you\u2019re here basically casing it.\n\nYou\u2019re not that well versed in the value of medical supplies and drugs, but you figure the Crimson Talons could be willing to fence whatever you bring. Hell, you probably could just sell the stuff yourself. You know more than enough folks in your area that bitch about not being able to afford shit from the local apothecary, let alone proper medicine.\n\nOf course since this is your first time here, you\u2019re still getting used to all the twisting corridors that this university seems to favor. You end up stepping into a class in session a couple times, before stumbling upon an unattended supply room where you pilfer various bottles of pills and liquids.\n\nWhen you attempt to leave the facility, you go in the direction where you think you came from, but soon find that you made a wrong turn somewhere.\n\nSomehow you manage to find yourself in what you think must be an office area since you see various doors with names on them. (All of them with \u201cDr.\u201d in front) As you\u2019re passing one, the door opens and you find yourself face to face with an older woman with gray hair.\n\n\u201cHey. You here about the job?\u201d the woman asks.\n\u201cHuh? What?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cI put out several announcements around campus for an escort job. Hmmm\u2026.you don\u2019t look like a warrior and you\u2019re a little young. You one of those students over from the magic college?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no actually, I just got lost. I\u2019m trying to find my way out of this place.\u201d\n\u201cLost? What were you doing here in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cWell my father used to go here and I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026you do you look a little familiar. What\u2019s your father\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nYou tell this woman your father\u2019s name and she instantly lights up.\n\n\u201cHah! I knew it. You look a lot like your father. He was in my microbiology class when I used to teach it. Did very well too. How he doing?\u201d the woman asks.\n\u201cOh he\u2019s doing fine uh Miss\u2026umm\u2026\u201d you reply\n\u201cOh I go by Dr. Gossey and nowadays I focus purely on zoology and the biology of the creatures and animals that live in our fascinating world! So are you a student here too and trying to follow in your dad\u2019s footsteps?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that I suppose. I\u2019m actually just checking out my options right now. You know, to see what I might be interested in.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Good. Glad to see a young person thinking about their future. Hey, would you consider yourself to be an adventurous spirit?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose in some ways I am.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve got a job that needs doing and I don\u2019t have time to do it myself and I\u2019d rather not send my assistant there by herself. You familiar with qweepas?\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t they some really ugly oversized rats?\u201d\n\u201cIn simple terms basically, but they\u2019re much more than that. They\u2019re actually much more intelligent than the average rat. They aren\u2019t even native to the continent, but a lot of them over the years have undoubtedly snuck aboard Hessla pirate ships and now they\u2019re slowly starting to gain a foothold as a pest on the coast. One can only imagine how far they will have spread in another ten years.\u201d\n\u201cSo what is it that you need exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI need someone to go into Hessla or around that area with my assistant and get me some live specimens. About ten should do. Like I said, I\u2019d send my assistant alone, but I know how dangerous Hessla is especially for a single female, so it would be better if someone went with her.\u201d\n\u201cSo, am I just to be there as hired muscle?\u201d\n\u201cYes, though as I noticed before, you don\u2019t seem to be a physical type\u2026not to say you aren\u2019t well proportioned for a young man your age, it\u2019s just I was hoping to get a taker from the gladiator team or someone of similar intimidating size. I only mentioned this at all to you because for one, I haven\u2019t had anyone else come in as strange as that may be. And two I knew your father. I figured it wouldn\u2019t be polite to not offer his son a chance to earn some money towards his education goals, whatever they may be. You could even get a jump start on potential class credits.\u201d\n\nThis is getting a little strange, but you might as well ask.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this job pay then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThirty gold pieces upon completion.\u201d Dr. Gossey replies.\n\u201cAnd all I have to do is escort your assistant?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and make sure the qweepa specimens get here alive. Those are very important to my research. My assistant will have everything else required for this job and the trip will essentially be completely paid for.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need a decision now?\u201d\n\u201cWell it would be nice, but I understand if you need to think on it. Hessla isn\u2019t a safe place and knowing your father, I\u2019m sure he wanted better for you and you grew up in a protected environment and are probably less familiar with handling folks with a more criminal mentality.\u201d\n\nDr. Gossey\u2019s assessment of you nearly makes you laugh.\n\nWhile this is technically a \u201creal\u201d job, you can\u2019t say you aren\u2019t totally unopposed to performing it. Thirty gold is certainly better than what you\u2019ve done in most weeks since your time here and it would give you a chance to go to Hessla for free. Maybe see if things are potentially more lucrative over there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the job", "result": "What the hell, it might make for an interesting change of pace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the job.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou will? Are you sure?\u201d Dr. Gossey asks.\n\u201cYes, and you don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m not unfamiliar with the seedier elements of life.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes I suppose there is no way of completely distancing yourself from such things. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re worldlier than you appear since I fear my assistant is a bit sheltered. Well, I suppose sheltered isn\u2019t quite the right word, more like disconnected from reality on these matters. Elana\u2019s a good student, but as I said, I fear if she went to Hessla by herself, she\u2019d say something to the wrong person and soon find herself sold into sex slavery or something similar. Anyway, just make sure you get those Qweepas safe and sound here.\u201d\n\u201cIs there some sort of place that sells them or something in Hessla?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just know that they are common enough there to be a problem. Whether that means you buy them or catch them, makes no difference. As I said, that\u2019s going to be Elana\u2019s primary concern, but obviously if you can help in that matter too, it would be greatly appreciated.\"\n\u201cOkay, so when does this job begin?\u201d\n\u201cWell since you agreed to it already, say in three days? You\u2019ll meet Elana at the carriage station in the morning. You\u2019ll recognize her by her tan skin, long curly brown hair, a large pack for the trip no doubt and she\u2019ll probably be a bit too well dressed for the occasion.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, hope I don\u2019t miss her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to give her your description as well and insist that she not leave until she finds you.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good to me. I\u2019ll meet your assistant then.\u201d\n\nDr. Gossey goes on to thank you and exclaim that she\u2019s glad you came along when you did and hopes you have a safe and productive trip. She also gives you directions of how to get out of the medical school, since you were lost in the first place.\n\nWhen you exit the medical school, you decide to call it a night and head home since you figure if you need to get up in the morning in three days, then you\u2019re going to have \u201cfix\u201d your internal clock again so you don\u2019t over sleep.\n\nWhen you finally get back to the neighborhood, you revert back your cautious ways until you finally enter the Welcome Mat and your room. You manage to make it without being accosted by any of its denizens this time.\n\nYou spend tomorrow mostly \u201ctaking the day off.\u201d You go get something to eat a few times, but that\u2019s about it. You still don\u2019t see Virgil, but you do have a vague feeling that someone is watching you every time you leave the damn inn.\n\nOn the second day of one these food trips, one of the local food merchants who doesn\u2019t normally make much small talk, breaks that habit when you\u2019re looking over the fruit cart.\n\n\u201cHey, some big guy was looking for you yesterday.\u201d The merchant remarks.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. Got a better description than that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUh, sort of a bushy beard, but the rest of his face was obviously pretty weathered. Shaved head. Probably in his forties or fifties, but still pretty fit. Carried a pack with him, but no weapons. Well at least none out in the open. Said to tell you that he\u2019d carrying an important message for you from your family and that it\u2019s very urgent that you meet him at the Raggedy Man Inn.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, and that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll just be taking these today.\u201d You say and pay the merchant for your food before leaving.\n\nWell that was way more productive than asking Virgil. It\u2019s all a little sinister now that you have a little more information though. Why the hell wouldn\u2019t a simple courier just meet you at the inn you\u2019re staying at? You suppose it\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t know, but if he\u2019s already spoken to Randi or Virgil, one of them has no doubt blabbed already. At least Randi probably did.\n\nYou don\u2019t know much about the Raggedy Man inn except it\u2019s in an even worse part of Klyton than you already stay at. Klyton might have militia patrols marching all over the place, but they\u2019re still lax in certain areas. Makes you a bit wary that a large man wants to meet you there. You can\u2019t imagine your father or mother would send someone like that, let alone want him to meet you under HIS conditions. Your sister maybe? Possible you suppose, but you\u2019re skeptical.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re not meeting this guy unless he comes directly to you and when that happens. You\u2019re going to be\u2026\n\n\u201cHeeeeeeey! Youngster! You got some coppers fer the (hic!) faith?\u201d Virgil suddenly says as you step into the Welcome Mat.\n\nHe\u2019s obviously forgotten his outrage at you. Fortunately he may have even remembered to take your advice about washing last time since he smells half way decent this time.\n\n\u201cActually I do Virgil, but I need a favor from you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure\u2026sure! I\u2019ve always liked ya son! (hic!) You need Joachim\u2019s blessin?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, nothing like that. I just need you to relay a message. Remember that big guy looking for me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Oh YEAH! Yeah! I remember him! Hey he was lookin\u2019 fer you\u2026yesterday\u2026said he wants you to\u2026\u201d Virgil starts to say before you interrupt.\n\u201cGood, good, I want you to tell him, the next time he sees you that I left for Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? You\u2019re movin?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that, but I want you to tell him okay? Don\u2019t forget.\u201d you say and hand Virgil a few coppers.\n\u201cK\u2026well Jochim\u2019s blessin\u2019 on ya if yer leaving then. You always were one of da (hic!) good ones.\u201d\n\nVirgil pats you on the back and then stumbles off.\n\nYou return to your room and as an added pre-caution, you put a chair against the door. You have no idea how you\u2019re going to get a good night\u2019s sleep for tomorrow, but you\u2019re going to try\u2026\n\nAnd you fail.\n\nYou get a couple hours in before you wake up and can\u2019t go back to sleep. Seeing as you aren\u2019t going to get any more sleep, you pack your stuff and decide to leave your room in the middle of night and just head to the carriage station early. You don\u2019t really know when Elana is going to show up there anyway, so you might not even have to wait that long.\n\nOn your way there, you half think you\u2019re being followed the entire time, so you do a lot of back tracking and take side streets until you reach your destination.\n\nYou\u2019ve never been to the carriage station before, but it\u2019s mostly empty right now. Still, it\u2019s well lit and there are a few militiamen stomping around. You never thought you\u2019d be happy about that!\n\nYou find a bench and wait. Soon, you start to get a little sleepy again despite your attempts at still trying to stay awake. You also start to wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be better to just stay in Hessla when you get there.\n\n\u201cI oughta just go meet this guy and stab him in the face like I did with Klint\u2026\u201d you mutter to yourself.\n\nLater\u2026\n\n\u201cHey! Wake up! We have to get a move on! (Sigh) I told Dr. Gossey I didn\u2019t need an escort.\u201d You hear a voice exclaim while some hands shove your shoulders a few times.\n\nYou groggily open your eyes and realize you\u2019re in a much more horizontal position from when you first closed your eyes. After getting the blurriness out, you see a finely dressed woman with tan skin and long curly hair before you.\n\n\u201cElana?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes! And you\u2019re the escort Dr. Gossey hired I presume. You ARE aren\u2019t you? I\u2019d hate to think I just woke up some random sleeping bum.\u201d Elana answers.\n\u201cYes, the doctor hired me. How long have I been asleep?\u201d\n\u201cHow should I know? All I do know is I had to load this carriage up myself. I thought YOU would be helping! Anyway, we have to get going, hurry up!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m ready, let\u2019s get in the carriage.\u201d\n\u201cWait. YOU are not going in the carriage.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Then where the hell am I supposed to be?\u201d\n\u201cYou ride up top with the driver. I have some studying to do on the way and I don\u2019t want you disturbing me. Besides, if you\u2019re supposed to keeping an eye out for danger, you\u2019ll do it better from there anyway.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too damn early in the morning to deal with this, so you decide not to and just go over to the carriage and climb up to where the driver is. He nods and greets you.\n\n\u201cSo are we ready to go?\u201d the driver asks you.\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s go!\u201d Elana shouts from inside the carriage.\n\u201cWell you heard the lady.\u201d You say.\n\nAnd with that, you\u2019re on your way out of Klyton and on the road to Hessla. Right now though you\u2019re just trying to adjust your eyes to all the damn sunlight. It\u2019s been awhile since you\u2019ve been up this early.\n\nYou watch the countryside pass by as the horses travel at a good pace. So far no trouble yet. You look behind you and see the supplies on the roof of the carriage and something you didn\u2019t notice right behind you and the driver. A blunderbuss.\n\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s for when bandits attack?\u201d you ask the driver.\n\u201cHuh? Oh that? I suppose so. Honestly though, haven\u2019t had any problems in all the years I\u2019ve driven this route. Still, I keep it loaded just in case.\u201d The driver replies.\n\u201cNever?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Never even had any problems in Hessla, despite its reputation. A lot of people think its some anarchic pirate paradise, but the place is probably just as orderly as Klyton. The Governor of Hessla has his own personal security force called the Headsmen to patrol the place. They\u2019re a lot more draconian than the militia too. Usually they just execute offenders on the spot without trial.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cSure. I mean yeah without them then the place might be a little more lawless like it was in the past, but nowadays? You\u2019re just as safe from getting mugged there as you would in Klyton. Hell, maybe even more so given that Klyton has the Crimson Talons running around.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yeah.\u201d\n\nWell this sucks. Already you\u2019re finding out that Hessla isn\u2019t the place you imagined it was. It\u2019s kind of why you took most of your important belongings with you just in case you decided to ditch the job and just stay in Hessla.\n\n\u201cDriver! Slow down! The ride is too bumpy and I can\u2019t focus on my reading!\u201d Elana shouts while banging inside the carriage.\n\nA few moments later\u2026\n\n\u201cDriver! Speed up! I\u2019d like to get Hessla sometime this month! And YOU up there, I hope you\u2019re doing your job and keeping a look out!\u201d\n\nThen again, Hessla might not be that bad, if you already had a bit of coin to throw around while you assessed the opportunities there. You think that there is probably a good amount of supplies here on the carriage you could sell. Let alone the horses and carriage themselves. The driver doesn\u2019t exactly look like a fighter and might even have a few coins to his name.\n\nAnd most importantly, Elana probably is carrying a purse full of coin for this trip.\n\nWouldn\u2019t take much to just grab the blunderbuss and hijack this whole carriage.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hijack the carriage", "result": "Yeah, you\u2019re done with Klyton, and this whole job attempt\u2026\n\nYou reach for the blunderbuss and upon grasping it, the carriage hits a bump in the road, which temporarily causes you to teeter and sway. Unfortunately this is enough time to allow the driver to realize what you\u2019re attempting to do.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even say anything he just lets go of the horse reins and elbows you in the face though it isn\u2019t enough to drop the firearm. He then attempts to take his blunderbuss back.\n\nYou struggle with the driver until he realizes he isn\u2019t strong enough to take it from you. Just as you\u2019re about to yank it completely away, the driver lets go and you pull so hard you lose balance. The driver then takes advantage of this by pushing you off the carriage.\n\nYou fall off the carriage with the blunderbuss still in hand, and land hard on your back, but luckily still out of the way of the carriage wheels. However, upon you impact with the ground, your hand was around the trigger of the blunderbuss, which you accidently pulled.\n\nThe shrapnel hits back wheel of the carriage and shatters a portion of it. The carriage manages to continue for a second before the back wheel\u2019s structure is completely destroyed and soon the carriage tips over on its side. The horses drag the carriage a bit longer, before the harness breaks and they\u2019re free of the wreck.\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019re partially watching from the distance and still wincing in pain from falling. You didn\u2019t break anything, but your back hurts like hell. As quick as you can walk, you make your way over to the tipped over carriage.\n\nYou\u2019re fairly certain the driver had to have fallen off. If he didn\u2019t die, you\u2019re going to finish the job. You aren\u2019t sure about Elana, chances are she\u2019s alive and still in the carriage, but if she insists on getting mouthy like she\u2019s been with you before, you\u2019ll teach her a lesson too.\n\nWhen you finally get within the area of the carriage you see some of the supplies scattered all over the road and the body of the driver. He\u2019s face down and not moving. You go over to check by prodding him with the blunderbuss and he\u2019s still not moving. Looks like he probably broke his neck.\n\nWhile you\u2019re inspecting the driver, you hear rustling in the carriage, along with some groans. Looks like Elana lived. If she wants to continue living, she better comply.\n\nYou go over to the sideways carriage, climb on top it and open the door. Looking downward, you see that Elana is still in a semi-prone position opposite of you.\n\nElana may have a bossy upper class way about her, but she wasn\u2019t completely unwise in the ways of being in potential danger.\n\nAlready dazed and scared from the crash, upon seeing you standing menacingly over her with a blunderbuss in hand she reacts without even thinking that you MIGHT potentially be helping her rather than robbing her. (Though that was a correct assumption on her part because you totally were going to rob her)\n\n\u201cOkay, you\u2026shit!\u201d you say before you\u2019re interrupted by Elana pulling a small ornate pistol and firing.\n\nThe bullet isn\u2019t even very big, but they don\u2019t need to be when they hit something vital.\n\nYou clutch at your throat and fall backwards off the carriage. You don\u2019t even die right away, you gag, cough blood and convulse a bit. You even manage an attempt to get back up, but by the time Elana drags herself out of the carriage, you\u2019re a corpse.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stick with the job at hand", "result": "Tempting, but you might as well stick with it out a little while longer. Oddly part of you doesn\u2019t want to dishonor the agreement with Dr. Gossey even if her assistant is a bitch.\n\nElana doesn\u2019t make many more complaints fortunately and when she does it\u2019s mostly at the driver anyway, though you can imagine you\u2019ll soon be on the receiving end completely.\n\nBy the time you reach Hessla, night is starting to fall. Elana orders the carriage to stop and then asks the driver where is the best place to stay in the town. The driver suggests the Cozy Krak Inn. He mentions that it is fairly expensive though that usually means it\u2019s never completely filled, but Elana tells him she isn\u2019t worried about the price.\n\nThe carriage makes its way through Hessla, which is definitely not how you expected it look. You imagined pirates and vagabonds of all types getting into fights and drinking in the streets, but just like the driver said, it isn\u2019t actually all that bad.\n\nWhen you get to the Cozy Krak Inn, you see a large decorated building, which wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the richer areas of Klyton. It\u2019s actually a little more creative looking since it has a whole sea theme complete with some wall murals of sailors battling a giant squid and the inn sign also being in the shape of a squid.\n\n\u201cUgh, how gauche. I suppose it will have to do.\u201d Elana remarks and gets out of the carriage. You step off from the top.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go in and getting the room, you grab the supplies from the carriage.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019m just supposed to be here for protection. I didn\u2019t hear anything about being your porter. Besides, doesn\u2019t a place like this usually have someone to do that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m telling YOU to do it. I\u2019m not risking having the locals run off with valuable equipment and you\u2019re getting paid to protect EVERYTHING, so do your job and look out for the stuff!\u201d Elana remarks and doesn\u2019t even give you a chance to retort before she\u2019s entered the inn.\n\nYou just stand there speechless for a moment.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026there\u2019s a cart over there which should help you get it in all one trip.\u201d The driver points out in an attempt to be sympathetic to your plight.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You grumble and begin to unload the carriage.\n\nYou should have just hijacked it.\n\nAfter you\u2019re done unloading everything, the driver mentions that if you\u2019re looking for a place to unwind, the Sultry Siren is a good location. He then bids you good night and takes his leave.\n\nYou enter the inn and find that it resembles more of a mansion than any inn you\u2019ve ever seen. No creaky wooden floors, dim lighting or drunken louts sitting at a nearby bar. You see a desk where Elana is talking with someone and a couple of mean looking men holding poleaxes standing just inside the doorway.\n\nYou arrive just in time for Elana to finish bitching at the desk clerk and start bitching at you instead.\n\nShe first goes on to complain that there is no lift so she has to walk to her room on the top floor like a commoner. This is even worse news for you since now you have to lug everything up several flights of stairs.\n\nAfter getting to the room, she complains that it doesn\u2019t match anything she\u2019s used to in Klyton and goes on about how inferior it is. You almost feel like saying you live in a place run by a cranky old man and how your closest neighbors consist of a drunken priest and a whore.\n\nTrying to make the best of this, you remain upbeat.\n\n\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t going to be here long hopefully. Let\u2019s just try to get some rest.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Elana says.\n\u201cI\u2019m just laying down.\u201d\n\u201cNot on the bed you\u2019re not!\u201d\n\u201cBut there are TWO beds and I\u2019m not going to try anything!\u201d\n\u201cPfft. I\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d Elana says and then brandishes a small ornate pistol. Smaller than other ones you\u2019ve seen actually, but you still don\u2019t want to risk getting shot by it and move out of the way when she thoughtlessly points it at you.\n\n\u201cWill you stop waving that thing around?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI told Dr. Gossey I didn\u2019t need an escort and could take care of myself.\u201d Elana remarks.\n\u201cYeah, okay you\u2019re not a woman to be messed with, got it. But I don\u2019t see why I have to sleep on the floor when there are two beds.\u201d\n\u201cThe floor? You\u2019re not sleeping on the floor either. This is MY room. You want a room here, you pay for it yourself!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What? Are you serious? Dr. Gossey said this trip was paid for!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for me, never said anything about you. Your payment is AFTER the job is done. In fact, shouldn\u2019t you just be standing guard outside my door?\u201d\n\nYou have no words. You just don\u2019t. You thought dealing with the lowlifes that hang around the Welcome Mat was a chore, but it still pales in comparison to this. If this wasn\u2019t a paying job, there is no way you\u2019d deal with this.\n\nHowever, since it is, you don\u2019t say anything and just grab a chair in the room and exit.\n\nPlacing the chair nearby, you sit down and make a mental note about never working a real job ever again. The kicker is, you still have a bunch of over grown rats to acquire. Still, you agreed to this so you continue to make the effort and sit outside like a loser.\n\nEventually enough time passes and you start feeling tired or at least bored enough that you\u2019d rather be doing something else. You briefly think about finding another place to stay or even going to the Sultry Siren like the driver suggested, but you really don\u2019t feel like dealing with the stairs again or spending your money. You then wonder if maybe you shouldn\u2019t take this opportunity to break into some of the other rooms.\n\nAs you\u2019re pondering potential criminal activity, you spot a group of five rough looking men walking down the corridor. They don\u2019t look the sort who would stay here.\n\n\u201cIs this the room?\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s further up the hall.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cWhat? Where that guy in the hood is sitting?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I believe so.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Metzger. I thought you said this was an easy one.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one guy there and he\u2019s smaller than all of us. You really think he\u2019s going to give us trouble? Metzger says.\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s some highly skilled assassin? I mean he\u2019s got a hooded cloak and all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBy Dolak\u2019s barnacle encrusted balls, if you were any dumber\u2026(Sigh) Just because someone is wearing a hooded cloak don\u2019t make them a highly skilled assassin. Besides, assassins kill people not sit outside hallways like guard dogs.\u201d Metzger remarks.\n\nAt this point these five men are nearby you, yet are still talking like you aren\u2019t here. You feel like you should stand up at this point.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but notice you lot seem to be talking about me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, and what if we are?\u201d Metzger asks.\n\u201cWell, I suppose I might need to show off my assassin skills.\u201d\n\u201cHah! You\u2019re no assassin and even if you are, you\u2019re too damn young to have been at it for very long, let alone skilled enough to take on five of us. My guess is, you\u2019re that rich bitch\u2019s escort or something. Not sure why she\u2019d take a little thing like you though as a guard. Guess being rich doesn\u2019t mean being smart which is evident by the very fact she\u2019s staying here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cNobody stays at the Cozy Krak Inn, or rather no right thinking Hessla native does, unless they want to be taken as a fucking slave. Fucking clueless visitors.\u201d Metzger laughs.\n\nWell this isn\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cSo you guys are all slavers huh?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, and since I\u2019m in a generous mood I\u2019m going to LET you walk away from this, because Yrid said you weren\u2019t the target.\u201d Metzger remarks.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Yrid?\u201d\n\u201cThe guy who drove you here. Sheesh, didn\u2019t you even bother to ask his name? In fact you weren\u2019t even supposed to be here, he said you\u2019d probably be at the Sultry Siren fucking a whore or getting drunk given how much your boss was bitching at you.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m starting to think that was a better idea right now.\u201d\n\u201cHah, got that right. So, I trust you\u2019re stepping aside then\u2026\u201d Metger says and starts advancing with his buddies.\n\nThis is a really difficult situation. As much as Elana has been a complete bitch to you, you aren\u2019t sure if her getting sold into slavery isn\u2019t disproportionate retribution.", "action_results": [{"action": "Step aside", "result": "You don\u2019t exactly feel good about this, but then you don\u2019t see as you have much choice.\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026I\u2019ll step aside.\u201d you say.\n\u201cSmart boy, now clear off!\u201d Metzger says and pushes you aside before unlocking the door with a key.\n\nYou don\u2019t stick around as the five of them enter Elana\u2019s room. Just as you\u2019re about to head down the stairs, you hear a scream followed by something breaking and then some laughter.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to think about it and make haste out of this \u201cinn.\u201d Even when you killed Klint there was at least some justification, but you\u2019re seriously wondering what the hell you just allowed to happen.\n\nYou head to the Sultry Siren where you proceed to drink. You\u2019ve never really drank too much before in the past, but given what you just let transpire, you feel like maybe the best thing you can do is block out your thoughts.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026are you interested in just the ale or could I recommend one of the lovely sirens in the back?\u201d the barkeep asks after you\u2019ve had a few.\n\u201cUm\u2026I dunno\u2026no. I\u2019m having a bit of weird night and I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind right now that I\u2019m trying to forget.\u201d you say taking another drink.\n\u201cHm, sounds like maybe one of our lovely sirens is exactly what you need.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t even hear the barkeep\u2019s pitch anymore; your mind is just sort of a hazy blur between your thoughts and the ale. What did you do? What could you do? What are you going to do?\n\nWhat are you going to do\u2026\n\n\u201cDo you know where I could get some qweepas?\u201d you suddenly ask the barkeep.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he replies.\n\u201cQweepas. They\u2019re these\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know what they are. Overgrown ugly rats and general pests around town. If you want to know where to get some, you could try Gilo\u2019s Gridiron. Well either that or just hang around the docks or leave some food around in a dark place. It isn\u2019t like they\u2019re that hard to find around here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Gilo\u2019s Gridiron?\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s just an eatery run by a Halfling chef. He sells qweepa on a stick. Tastes pretty good from what I hear, but I\u2019d never know because I\u2019m reluctant to eat a damn rat. Still, halflings do have a reputation for making anything taste good, so maybe I should be adventurous some day.\u201d\n\u201cSo is he open now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s too late now, he\u2019ll be open in the morning though.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know of a cheap place to sleep for the night?\u201d\n\u201cUm, the Barnacle down the street is pretty cheap. In fact you can just go into their public flop room for free. Wouldn\u2019t really advise that though unless you\u2019re a light sleeper or completely destitute. The Headsmen might keep relative order around here, but they can\u2019t stop every potential crime and you\u2019re likely to get robbed there. It\u2019s just common sense you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, common sense. You really need it to survive in this world.\u201d You say and take your last drink before leaving for the Barnacle.\n\nYou end up paying a few coppers for one of their better rooms there and get some rest. The next day, you have a bit of a headache, but you try to ignore it. You\u2019ve still got a job to do.\n\nFirst thing you do is head over to Gilo\u2019s place. Gilo is pretty much a small one-man operation as far as the cooking goes though he\u2019s got his son and daughter running around taking orders from customers. You were going to ask Gilo if he has any live qweepas, but the man seems to be too busy to do anything except cook and order his children around. You can sort of see into the kitchen, but there is no way you can enter it without someone seeing you.\n\nYou take your leave and walk around to the back of Gilo\u2019s to check out the back door and that\u2019s when you see his little boy tossing out a bunch of bones in a box. It\u2019s a pretty big box (for a Halfling child) and the boy is struggling to carry it.\n\n\u201cHey kid, you need help with that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? No, not really. Just dumping out some qweepa bones. We usually keep them in these boxes until we kill \u2018em.\u201d The boy says.\n\u201cYou catch a lot of them huh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but nowadays we sort of just breed them. It\u2019s a lot easier than catching them.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cSure. They get so tame they hardly even bite. It\u2019s a good thing people eat so many; otherwise we might get too many. They breed pretty fast.\u201d\n\u201cSo you just got boxes of tame qweepas in there?\u201d\n\u201cYep. Hey look I gotta get back to work or my dad will hide me.\u201d The little boy says and goes back inside.\n\nAnd then you get the idea.\n\nLater in the middle of the night, you return to Gilo\u2019s and break into the back door which has such a simple lock it\u2019s child\u2019s play to you, then again you don\u2019t imagine most people would bother breaking into this place.\n\nYou stumble about the kitchen for a moment before you hear the squeaking and go over to where you figure the qweepas are being kept.\n\nYou grab a box of qweepas who are squeaking their heads off and get out as quickly as you can. You then head to the carriage station where you fortunately don\u2019t have to wait long for a carriage to Klyton. You have to share it with some young couple who must have just got married or something because the two are so into each other you think they\u2019re going to have sex right in there in the carriage.\n\nStill, at least it makes the trip not boring and they aren\u2019t questioning why you\u2019re carrying a box full of big rats. (Which you have to keep from escaping every now and then)\n\nBy the time you arrive in Klyton, it\u2019s midday again. The couple gets off and you pay for a ride to the university. You\u2019re just hoping Dr. Gossey is the sort of woman you think she is and will accept the qweepas along with your tale of what happened to her assistant.\n\nEventually you get to the university and the medical school. Thankfully Dr. Gossey is in her office when you arrive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back! And so quick! I hear lots of squeaking from that box you\u2019re carrying. I trust you got them?\u201d Dr. Gossey says.\n\u201cYep, but I ended up getting more than just ten.\u201d You say.\n\nYou show Dr. Gossey who looks into the box.\n\n\u201cOhh, I see. Looks like you got a lot of younger ones\u2026how are they so tame?\u201d Gossey asks putting her finger near one which just sniffs at it.\n\u201cThe Halfling cook I got them from breeds them for food. They apparently eat them all the time in Hessla.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMakes sense. Though I suppose a few wild ones would have been interesting to research as well, but tame ones will probably be easier for intelligence testing. I really didn\u2019t expect so many. You want one as a pet or something?\u201d\n\u201cUm, nah. I\u2019d just like my thirty gold pieces.\u201d\n\u201cOkay sure. Just put that box over there and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Gossey goes to get your money, you put the box over on a table and just stare at the qweepas squeaking and going about their trapped lives. You then see some of them biting at one with darker fur which is desperately trying to run away and climb out, but can\u2019t due to the attacking qweepas pulling at her.\n\n\u201cHey! Stop that. I thought you guys were tame.\u201d you say and brush away the bullying qweepas along with taking out the qweepa being attacked. The little creature runs up your arm and then perches on your shoulder and nuzzles up against you, almost as a sign that it thanks you for rescuing it.\n\nDr. Gossey comes back with a pouch full of coins.\n\n\u201cHere you are. Hey, I see one on your shoulder. Did you change your mind?\u201d Gossey asks.\n\u201cYeah I think so.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cOkay, well I guess that concludes our business then. So, since you were so efficient on this job, could I count on you for others in the future?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. I dunno. Yeah, sure I guess.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! Just remember I post notices all around campus. Just keep an eye out and you can usually find me in my office or in the lab, but um\u2026actually just meet me in the office. The lab is a bit off limits to anyone who isn\u2019t facility right now. I feel like I\u2019m forgetting something\u2026oh wait! Where is Elana?\u201d\n\u201cOh, she insisted on staying in Hessla.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? For what purpose?\u201d\n\u201cShe said she found some new species of crab when she was exploring the shores near Hessla. Said she wanted to do some extra research and get a few to bring back, but she wanted me to bring the qweepas back to you immediately. She wouldn\u2019t hear anything else. I\u2019m sure you know how she is.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes she is pretty firm when she wants her way. I can imagine you probably tried your best to talk to her. I suppose Hessla\u2019s bad reputation is a bit exaggerated anyway and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine and I\u2019ll see her in a few days. At least you brought back the qweepas and that was the most important thing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you told me.\u201d\n\nWith Dr. Gossey\u2019s acceptance of your story she bids you goodbye and immediately goes over to look at her new qweepas. You take your leave with your own still on your shoulder.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long couple of days and right now all you want to do is head back to the Welcome Mat and your room. When you get there, you\u2019re immediately accosted by Virgil who is surprisingly less drunk than usual. Must be a slow day.\n\n\u201cHey! I thought you moved to Holgard!\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t move there.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t? But that\u2019s what you told me to tell that big guy looking for you.\u201d\n\nWith all that\u2019s gone on, you completely forgot about all that.\n\n\u201cOh right. Yeah I did. So what happened with that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat do ya think happened? I told \u2018im you left for Holgard and he thanked me with some coin and took off. I suppose if you\u2019re quick, you might be able to catch him on the road to Holgard.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t that important and if it was, I\u2019m not going to worry about it. Here you go Virgil.\u201d You say and toss him a gold coin which he profusely thanks you for and says how Joachim\u2019s blessing is upon you.\n\nYou enter your room and collapse on your bed. Your qweepa scurries off your body and onto the bed to sniff around. You watch the creature for a little while and then pet it.\n\n\u201cWell Elana. It might be shitty and run down, but at least you know you aren\u2019t going to run into slavers here.\u201d You say to your new pet.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 21\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, here\u2019s the rent.\u201d You say handing over a few silvers to Trobart.\n\nAs usual he grabs the silvers and gives you mean glance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting real tired of your shit! I KNOW you got the money to pay me on fucking time! Telling you right now, you keep pushing me like this, and you\u2019ll be out on your thieving ass!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t throw me out of this palace.\u201d You say.\n\nWhether Trobart caught your sarcasm or not, he doesn\u2019t acknowledge it with more verbal abuse, he just storms off. Sometimes it\u2019s just too much fun to mess with him.\n\nReally, you could probably afford to live somewhere better now, but this place is cheap enough that you\u2019re reluctant move. Besides if you lived some place more expensive, you wouldn\u2019t be able to spend your money on fun things like wine, women and better equipment on occasion.\n\nYou head back to your room where Elana comes up to greet you before scampering off again. One thing\u2019s for sure. You haven\u2019t had any problems with normal rats or other pests with Elana around. She\u2019s aggressively territorial and more than willing to make a meal out of them. Even Virgil doesn\u2019t knock on the door to bother you as much since she nearly bit his toe off.\n\nYou then hear a knock at your door. Well, it doesn\u2019t stop him completely.\n\n\u201cVirgil, I think you should know Elana\u2019s hungry right now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice that your girlfriend is starving, but I\u2019m not Virgil, whoever that is. I\u2019m from you friends in Klyton\u2019s most infamous club.\u201d You hear a voice answer. Sounds female.\n\u201cCrimson Talons?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Tell the militia why don\u2019t you? You going to let me in or not?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends\u2026why are you here? Nobody from the Talons has ever sought me out before.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well there\u2019s a first time for everything. Look, I\u2019m just here on Tom\u2019s orders. I\u2019m not shouting between a door like this. Either open the door, or I\u2019ll let him know you aren\u2019t interested\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, hold on.\u201d You say.\n\nYou tell Elana to stay and not attack (at least not immediately) and you go to open the door cautiously. Upon opening it, you see a dark longhaired woman who while is certainly older than you is still in fit condition. She\u2019s attractive in a trashy sort of way. (Sort of reminds you of an older version of Annah)\n\nWhile you\u2019ve been to the Talon\u2019s headquarters more than a few times, but other than Tom and a guy named Vaughn who is usually the fence for your stolen items, you can\u2019t really say you\u2019ve ever paid too much attention to most of them (let alone learned their names), so you don\u2019t really recognize her. However, with her looks combined with her attire and she definitely looks like the sort that would belong to the Crimson Talons.\n\nThe woman walks in without you even inviting her in and takes a look around.\n\n\u201cWow, some place you have here. I can see why you didn\u2019t want to join the Talons when you\u2019re obviously doing so well on your own.\u201d She says.\n\u201cRight, because that abandoned building you all squat in and have to sneak about by going in and out of the shit filled sewers is so much better.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cActually, I was paying you a compliment asshole. This place IS better. I mean yeah it\u2019s still a dump, but as you said, at least you\u2019re not stepping over shit every five minutes on your way here and it\u2019s all to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026not counting the rats of course.\u201d She adds when she sees Elana who is curled up in the corner where you told her to stay.\n\u201cElana\u2019s not a rat, she\u2019s a qweepa.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Elana? I thought it was weird I didn\u2019t see some strumpet on your bed when I walked in here. Well whatever it is, it\u2019s ugly and its teeth are too big.\u201d Zalmora says while taking a seat on your bed.\n\u201cSo are you just here to insult my home and my pet or are you actually going to tell me who you are and why Tom sent you?\u201d\n\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t insulting your home. Anyway, I\u2019m Zalmora and Tom wants to see you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d have to talk with him about the details, but basically he wants you to reconsider joining us.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve wasted a trip, because as you pointed out I\u2019m doing fine on my own. Besides, didn\u2019t several of your members just get arrested by that botched bank job recently?\u201d\n\u201cOnly two got caught and they weren\u2019t arrested because the militia killed them with they were resisting.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well that\u2019s different then. At the rate you lot are going I don\u2019t predict good things for you in the future. You can tell Tom thanks, but no thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he thought you might say that, and honestly if I were in your position I\u2019d probably feel the same way.\u201d\n\u201cGood, then we understand each other, goodbye\u2026\u201d you say and go to open the door again, but Zalmora doesn\u2019t even move, she just stretches out on your bed and makes herself more comfortable.\n\n\u201cAlthough, I also have to tell you that your cooperation on this matter is in your best interest.\u201d She says.\n\u201cSo, what then? Did Tom send you over here to fuck me in an effort to convince me to join? You seem to be getting quite comfortable on my bed.\u201d\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have that in mind, but if he really wanted to get results in that way, he should have sent the half-elven whores in the gang instead. If I had to guess why he sent me, it\u2019s because as much as he\u2019s loathed to admit it, I have a decent history of convincing folks. In any case, if you don\u2019t join, don\u2019t bother coming around with your stolen shit anymore, we won\u2019t be fencing it.\u201d\n\u201cSo is that your argument? If I don\u2019t join your little group, you aren\u2019t going to fence for me anymore? Fine. I\u2019ll just take my shit to Fookins the Fat.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cFookins? You\u2019re going to trust that goblin to fence your shit?\u201d Zalmora chuckles.\n\u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll just sell it myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t doubt that you could, but I get a vibe from you that you\u2019d rather not want to bother. If you were about that aspect of our game, you would have been doing it long before now.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you might be right, but obviously you lot aren\u2019t giving me a choice.\u201d\n\u201cSure we are. Join us and reap the benefits, or don\u2019t and suffer the consequences. I guess this would also be a good time to add that if you don\u2019t join us you might have a target on your back.\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t take long to get to physical threats. You immediately draw your weapon and Elana who was previously at rest, is now alert and prepared to attack on your command. Zalmora doesn\u2019t move though, she just continues to look up at the ceiling with her legs crossed. She either doesn\u2019t realize the seriousness of her situation, or she\u2019s so much of a skilled fighter that she isn\u2019t worried.\n\n\u201cYou can put that away, I\u2019m not going to kill or even attack you.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cYou just fucking threatened me in my own damn room!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cActually I didn\u2019t. Tom did and honestly I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got the balls to follow through on said threats. Other freelancers in the city? Maybe. You? Nah. You rescued him from a cage; he\u2019s never going to forget that. He\u2019s likely to be pissed and disappointed that you don\u2019t join, but he\u2019s not going to actively put a contract on your head. He\u2019s not like our last boss Edmund.\u201d\n\nAt this point she sits up and gets off your bed. You\u2019re still on your guard, but she keeps her distance.\n\n\u201cSince I can see you\u2019re a bit tense right now, I\u2019ll leave to let you think it over.\u201d\n\nZal\u2019s approach to this is confusing the hell out of you. It almost feels like she\u2019s deliberately trying to convince you NOT to join.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to think about. Your words have not swayed me, quite the opposite really. Maybe Tom should have sent those two halfbreed whores to convince me instead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTruly? Is a quick tumble all it would have really done to convince you? Well, let\u2019s get to it then.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWait, what, really?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cPfft, no!\u201d Zal laughs. \u201cLook, it\u2019s up to you if you want to join. I\u2019m not going over the benefits of joining, because I think you know what those could possibly be AND I think you\u2019re smart enough to know you\u2019re only going to get out of it, what you put in to it. Like I said, you once rescued Tom from a cage, so you\u2019re already in good standing with him. A lot better than most. I\u2019m just giving you a heads up on the downsides of not joining. If you\u2019re comfortable with those, then I guess the choice is easy. You know where to find us if you change your mind, but remember ONLY come to us, IF you change your mind.\u201d\n\nZal opens your door and begins to leave, but then stops.\n\n\u201cJust on a personal note, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing you join us. It would be nice to have another skilled rogue around to work with. Your independent actions in the university district aren\u2019t completely unknown to me. And who knows, we might just have that tumble after all.\u201d\n\nZal then nods at you with a smile and leaves.\n\nWell she didn\u2019t sway you until that last bit. Not the tumble part, (though you certainly wouldn\u2019t turn that down) but more of the idea of working with someone else.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about it too much, but you do sort of miss working with another person. You did it for years with your sister and then Annah for a short time. You\u2019re convinced that if tragedy hadn\u2019t struck with her, she probably would have gotten better.\n\nWorking by yourself has its advantages and over the years you\u2019ve gotten used to it, but there are more than a few times where it would have helped to have another person by your side. There\u2019s also the convenience that you\u2019d be able to have the Talons still fence shit for you and the possibility that you wouldn\u2019t have a target on your back, even if Zal says the latter is unlikely.\n\nStill, you really aren\u2019t sure about the whole joining the Crimson Talons thing. That\u2019s more people than you\u2019d care to work with and you\u2019d have to ultimately answer to someone. Let alone the other concerns you have.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the Crimson Talons", "result": "If Tom is coming to you, then it\u2019s obvious that he needs the help and that means you can go in and negotiate preferential treatment and benefits in exchange for your presence.\n\nWhat the hell, this might work out in your favor if you know how to play the game.\n\nYou immediately leave your room and catch up with Zalmora who hasn\u2019t walked too far from the Welcome Mat yet. You tell her you accept the offer and she seems to take satisfaction in that she managed to sway you.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re stomping through the sewers and embracing that unique aroma that only the sewers can provide.\n\nWhen you get to the Talon hideout, you\u2019re noticing a lot more rowdy types. Most of which look more like common thugs that would just mug you in an alley. Looks like the Talons aren\u2019t just recruiting the best, they\u2019re also recruiting the dregs. Guess they need to recoup their losses somehow.\n\n\u201cOkay, I imagine you want to go speak with Tom by yourself, so here you are.\u201d Zalmora remarks leaving you outside his office door.\n\nYou finish making your mental notes of what you\u2019re going to say and then enter. When you do so, Tom looks up from his desk and stands up to greet you.\n\n\u201cBy the gods, you actually showed up.\u201d Tom remarks.\n\u201cGood thing you sent someone so convincing, otherwise I might not have.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I might actually have to start rethinking my general dislike for her. Especially since she\u2019s proving to be one of the better members here nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cHm, yes well I still haven\u2019t joined yet. I\u2019m just here to stake out my options.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine you would, but that\u2019s perectly reasonable. I certainly didn\u2019t expect you to join without a few personal requests. So, take a seat, and let us talk about your future here!\u201d\n\nWhen the pair of you sit down, Tom goes into his speech. You didn\u2019t notice it before, but the man looks a lot wearier from the last time you met with him.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s no secret that you\u2019ve been doing okay for yourself by keeping your activities mainly to the university in Klyton.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t have much choice given you lot have run over most places and the militia excessively patrols the rest. Between the pair of you, I find that the university is the best place an independent like myself can make a fair living plying my trade.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYou know I never actually meant to be territorial with you. Other independents sure, but you were different and I have tried to tell my people in the past to leave you be and that there was plenty of room, but I can\u2019t keep up on everything they do when they leave my sight.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. It all worked out.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. In fact I briefly thought about expanding some of our activity out there. Never did mainly because we had things pretty good elsewhere and well let\u2019s just say professional respect for you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course since you\u2019ll be joining us, this changes things a bit. Now I understand if you want that area mostly to yourself, but times are getting a bit lean what with us losing several members and the militia seemingly cracking down everywhere.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like where this is heading.\n\n\u201cTom, if you start sending that mostly unsubtle rabble up at the university, they\u2019re going to be so fucking obvious that the militia WILL become more of an issue there! And if the militia start showing up there in force, that defeats the whole reason why I picked the place to begin with.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI know. I know. And I completely understand. That\u2019s why I want YOU to become, I dunno. A mentor of sorts.\u201d Tom says.\n\u201cMentor?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you could take those you think are the most promising and teach them not to draw attention and rob someone without just smashing them in the face and taking their shit by force.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not teaching a bunch of idiots something they should already know how to do when they joined up! I mean this is YOUR organization, you should be weeding out those who got what it takes and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me I\u2019d like to, but natural talent is a little lean right now and we need to make up the numbers in eagerness.\u201d\n\nTom rubs his eyes and exhales a bit before continuing.\n\n\u201cKid, as you might have guessed, the Crimson Talons are in fucking trouble and I need all the help I can get in keeping it together. I dunno if you know him, but one of my brasher members Jake is constantly chomping at the bit to do as much fucking violence as possible whenever he goes out on a job. Honestly his behavior is infectious to the other members at this point.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s that much of a problem, why not just kill him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause for one thing, he\u2019s really good at what he does and is a good earner. Second, he actually keeps the rest of them in line. With him around at least all I have to do is give an order to him and he can make sure everyone else follows it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty dangerous that he has that much power.\u201d\n\u201cWell I might be more worried if he actually displayed any signs of wanting to be in charge. As far as I can tell, all he ever wants to do is go out and commit crimes and fuck Zalmora. He\u2019s not a long term planner and definitely doesn\u2019t seem to want the hassle of being in charge and I can\u2019t say I blame him with how I feel about it right now.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so, but I\u2019m still not keen on playing mentor and this definitely isn\u2019t what I planned on when Zal talked me into coming here.\n\u201cI know. I know. (Sigh) Look, here\u2019s the deal. You get to keep everything you steal. You don\u2019t have to contribute anything to the general Talon funds. All I want you to contribute is your knowledge and your influence.\u201d\n\u201cMy influence? Not sure if I\u2019m exactly a leader myself.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you just haven\u2019t been given the proper chance. As I said, I\u2019m getting too fucking old to manage all of this myself. And I don\u2019t have anyone really reliable to help. I mean Jake is a guard dog at best. And I\u2019d rather not give any more power to Zalmora than I have to. I know you though. You\u2019ve got an honor that the others lack and we need some of that around here otherwise this whole organization is going to either fall apart in a few years or we\u2019re all going to get nabbed by the militia. With you with us, I think we could at least change direction a bit. And don\u2019t just think about the organization\u2019s future, but think about your own as well. I mean sure you\u2019re doing okay on your own, but with proper resources behind you? You could be doing so much better. Who knows maybe in so many years, YOU could be running this organization.\u201d\n\nTom made a similar argument to you before about joining last time. You weren\u2019t sure about it last time and you\u2019re still not sure about it this time. However, you get the impression if you don\u2019t involve yourself Tom isn\u2019t going to be around to lead much longer and who knows what the hell will happen. They might start encroaching your territory and you wouldn\u2019t really be able to stop them. In fact they might get so wild that the militia cracks down even worse than it already does.\n\nYou really aren\u2019t sure if this is a good idea, but you figure you have a bit of experience now under your belt so you can better afford to take a risk and as always you could just disappear if things aren\u2019t going well.\n\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll see how this goes.\u201d You say.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 22\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re done robbing everyone at the gladiator frat house, you get the fuck outta there. What you don\u2019t fucking do is stick around to drink, party and compete in a dick sucking contest!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nFlameflower and Sunshine both roll their eyes in unison.\n\n\u201cIt was hardly a competition. I easily beat all the other girls there that night.\u201d Flameflower remarks.\n\u201cWhat? I would have beaten you had you not spiked my drink with lotus! My technique was all fucked up thanks to that!\u201d Sunshine says.\n\u201cLook, nevermind all that! You wanna go suck dick, go suck it on your own time! But when you\u2019re on a job at the university you\u2019re on MY time and you will stick to the damn program! Otherwise you can go take your asses back to Jake and continue risking life and limb on whatever crazy heist he attempts to implement.\u201d\n\u201cUgh! I dunno why you\u2019re getting so mad for, we managed to pick even more pockets by sticking around for the extended festivities. Whatever. You\u2019re just like how your uptight dad was.\u201d\n\nFlameflower and her sister take their leave of you and then one of them turns her head to look at you briefly and then giggling follows between the pair of them.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why I bother with those two.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBecause elves are easy on the eyes, even if they are half breeds.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cWell it certainly works in their favor at the university. Hard to believe they were ever organized enough to work for my father\u2019s inn at one time. That was surprising to learn when they first approached to work with me. Do elves age at all?\u201d\n\u201cNot like we do. Those halfbreed bitches are older than me and they still look like fucking teenagers. Oh speaking of unnatural things, I think the magic college is more doable than you thought.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You actually went in there?\u201d\n\u201cI told you I was.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me you were thinking about it and I distinctly told you to stay away from that place. Too risky fucking around with potential magic security.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever even been there?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell then what would you even know about it? And for your information, it isn\u2019t the magic fortress that you seemed to think it was anyway. I walked in and walked out with this!\u201d\n\nZalmora reveals a blue gemstone of some sort. It gives off a faint blue glow, but nothing else.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what is that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, something magical I imagine. Maybe it provides light so you don\u2019t need a torch or lantern.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cOr maybe it captures souls! How did you even get this?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I walked into the college and wandered around until I found something that caught my eye. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t attract any attention, well other than maybe a few love sick apprentices who didn\u2019t look like they got out much.\u201d\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t protected or anything?\u201d\n\u201cNope, I just found it in a bowl on a shelf in an empty classroom of some sort. Would have taken more items, but I figured I\u2019d stick to mostly casing the place first. I told you, the place isn\u2019t any better protected than any place else it seems. Your ideas that the place is protected by magic traps and living statues are unfounded.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced and I think you just got lucky.\u201d\n\u201cWell either way, I\u2019m heading there again in a few days and hauling out more shit. I know a few people that would be more than willing to buy stuff like this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd maybe you better not. I\u2019m telling you, this is not a good idea and all its going to do create trouble for all of us. The university is huge, you can easily make a lot of coin without the extra danger of fucking around with magic.\u201d\n\nNow Zalmora rolls her eyes.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know those two halfbreed bitches might be whores in thieves clothing, but at least they\u2019re having fun with all this. You know, the only reason why I wanted to be transferred here instead of sticking with Jake is because I thought this might be a nice change of pace to work around a subtler thief. It\u2019s one thing to be professional, but by the fucking gods, you\u2019ve managed to suck out ALL the fun out of this. If it were up to you, you\u2019d still be meekly sneaking around the campus all by yourself and never maximizing the full potential of what is here!\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019d be perfectly fine with that. This was all Tom\u2019s idea for me to play mentor, not mine.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cHah! I don\u2019t need a damn mentor. I\u2019ve been thieving before you were even thought about! And I don\u2019t need your damn permission either to go rob the magic college. Maybe you can intimidate the rest of the unskilled Talons into acting the way you want, but I\u2019m doing what the hell I want.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? And I can go report you to Tom and have you transferred back. You\u2019re ONLY here because I said it was okay in the first place!\u201d\n\u201cFine. Go tattle on me like a fucking bitch then. Always knew you had a stick up your ass, but I didn\u2019t realize you were a snitch too.\u201d\n\u201cOh don\u2019t give me that snitch shit. Tom\u2019s the boss, he told me I had independent jurisdiction here of who was obeying my way of doing things and who wasn\u2019t. So if I don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re doing shit, guess what? You don\u2019t get to stay and that\u2019s it!\u201d\n\u201cI see. You\u2019re not a snitch, you\u2019re a pretender to the throne.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pretender to the throne. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re the boss of the Crimson Talons. The only thing that\u2019s stopping you totally is the fact that Tom is officially in charge. But if he\u2019s allowing you this much leniency and is basically doing what you say anyway then maybe you need to just cut the pretending and take over completely. I\u2019d certainly be more likely to respect AND listen to your orders if that was the case. But then I always preferred men who take what they want\u2026guess that\u2019s why I never minded Jake, even if he is an idiot most of the time. See you around.\u201d\n\nZalmora at this point takes her leave of you.\n\nYou\u2019ve been working with Zalmora directly only for a few months, but now you\u2019re starting to see why Tom thinks she\u2019s manipulative. She basically just suggested that you go kill him and take over.\n\nFor what purpose though you can\u2019t say. If she really doesn\u2019t like Tom, why doesn\u2019t she just do it? Though you suppose keeping her own hands clean and being a puppet master is more her thing. After all if you were in charge, you\u2019d catch the blame if things didn\u2019t go well.\n\nYou suppose it\u2019s an idea to consider, but again even if you wanted the hassle, you\u2019re still not really someone that wants to just kill someone without a good reason. Tom\u2019s been okay with you too, more than okay actually. He is a bit of a weak leader though. You do sort of wonder how he hasn\u2019t caught a knife in the back yet, or the front for that matter.\n\nAnd Zalmora might be right, might be time to take more risks. The thieves under your \u201ccommand\u201d listen to you, but the actual respect is probably minimal. It might be worth while to keep your options open to become more of a true leader just in case, you wanted to reconsider being head of the Crimson Talons one day.", "action_results": [{"action": "Start becoming a leader", "result": "Why not? It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re ever going to get a real job and this is probably the closest thing to \u201cmoving up\u201d in your line of work. And it is true, if you became leader of the Crimson Talons, you could shape it how you wanted.\n\nYou rush to catch up to Zalmora who hasn\u2019t walked too far away yet.\n\n\u201cZal, hold on.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes?\u201d she answers.\n\u201cLook, you\u2019ve got some good points. Maybe I\u2019m just used to playing things safe because it\u2019s traditionally what I\u2019ve had to do in the past.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose most of the Talons haven\u2019t exactly made things easier in this city with all the really reckless behavior that half of them participate in. But there\u2019s gotta be a balance right? I think the way you go about things is the direction we should be moving in, just we need to start thinking bigger and quite frankly we\u2019re never going to do that with Tom in charge.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what, you suggesting we should kill him then? I don\u2019t see why you don\u2019t do it since you seem to be really keen on getting rid of him.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to lead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I do?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re standing here speaking with me and thinking about what I said.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a killer either\u2026look I\u2019ve only ever killed one person and I only did that because he had just mortally stabbed my girlfriend at the time. It was sort of the heat of the moment and I dunno\u2026I\u2019ve just never been that motivated to just go murder someone again. Especially someone like Tom who has been more than all right with me.\u201d\n\u201cEh\u2026well I guess it\u2019s a good thing you aren\u2019t as blood thirsty as Jake is. Maybe though you could talk him out of stepping down.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if that\u2019s going to work, but in any case I don\u2019t think even with a promotion by murder is going to spontaneously cause people to follow me. I\u2019m going to need to build more respect and like you said, that means taking a few more risks. So making some bigger scores would help in that area as well. In other words, I\u2019m going to come with you on this job to the magic college.\u201d\n\nZal smiles a bit at your comment.\n\n\u201cSo the magic college isn\u2019t off limits anymore?\u201d Zal asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not off limits to US. I don\u2019t want anyone else trying to pilfer from the place until we completely do a thorough casing of the place. Exits, entrances, possible traps or security, valuables, everything. And even then I only want us going in and trying this until some of the others prove themselves capable of being professional enough. I might be becoming a little more flexible on risk taking, but I\u2019m not completely abandoning caution.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s sounds reasonable. Okay, so when do we get started?\u201d\n\nYou go over the information that Zal has already acquired during her trip to the place. You have no reason to disbelieve her claims that the place isn\u2019t as secure as you thought, you just think that maybe there is more than meets the eye. You tell her that you will go in and do your own inspection and then both of you together can go grab everything you can in one big haul.\n\nUsing Zal\u2019s previous knowledge, you begin your own scouting of the college. She wasn\u2019t wrong about magical looking items just laying around in class rooms. In general you attempt to stay out of sight. Maybe Zal was comfortable charming horny apprentices, but you doubt if you\u2019re going to get anything other than suspicion. As it turns out it\u2019s fairly easy to stay out of sight anyway since the college of magic is relatively empty. Makes sense you guess since there isn\u2019t exactly large amounts of wizard types nowadays either.\n\nYour scouting reveals a little more than Zal\u2019s attempts. You find a huge storage are area in the basement that contains a shitload of items. Most of it is furniture, though very nice looking furniture, if very dusty. However some of this stuff is literally encrusted with jewels or made of precious metal like silver and gold!\n\nYou can\u2019t believe it\u2019s all just laying around in this place without even a locked door! Granted a solid gold conference table would be pretty damn hard to lift up out of here even by several people, but the smaller items like the various knick knacks you could just take and you could just start prying out the gems on some of these chairs at least.\n\nYou wonder why all this valuable stuff is down here; maybe these are all some sort of relics of a more magical era? They don\u2019t seem magical though, so you have no idea; you just decide to take a few of the smaller gold vases before leaving.\n\nYou start looking around thinking that maybe there is some sort of stone statues looming nearby ready to come to life or something, but you leave this odd storage area without any problems.\n\nYou leave the magic college without incident and later reconnect with Zal and explain what you found; she seems pretty enthusiastic about heading there with you together.\n\nLater on that week, the pair of you sneak into the magic college at night. Zal says that since you apparently found a small treasure room of sorts, she wants to go there first. You figured she would so you lead her to where you found it.\n\nWhen you arrive, her eyes light up.\n\n\u201cI almost thought you were exaggerating. I have to admit this is almost too easy. I guess being a wizard means being too arrogant to know when to lock up your valuables.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cWell come on, let\u2019s start prying out those gems and grabbing the smaller stuff. I think we\u2019ll have to be making more than one trip down here.\u201d\n\nZal at this point pulls out her dagger and goes to work on a nearby chair, or throne to be more accurate. You join in by looking for the ornaments that were by the vases you took last time.\n\nYou don\u2019t get too far along in your looting when you start to get an uneasy feeling. You look over at Zal, but she\u2019s still busy prying gemstone.\n\nThen out the corner of your eye you see some figures suddenly appear, you turn around and then catch a bolt of lightning in the chest!\n\n\u201cYvette! I told you to wait, before attacking!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, when we reappeared I panicked.\u201d\n\u201cI told you invisibility never lasts long.\u201d\n\u201cGet that one before she gets away!\u201d\n\nThe apprentices and mages of this college apparently weren\u2019t completely unaware that strangers were coming and going into their domain. And apparently one of the professors decided that stopping a pair of thieves would be a good training lesson.\n\nUnfortunately for you, Yvette\u2019s lightning bolt zapped you really good. The impact threw you into a wall, burned a hole in your body and fried your internal organs. She didn\u2019t even mean to kill you; she just didn\u2019t know her own power.\n\nHardly matters, you\u2019re still dead and so are all your plans of being the Crimson Talons leader.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Keep things simple", "result": "You\u2019re not falling for Zal\u2019s manipulation. Tom can keep the headaches because you\u2019ve got enough of it just dealing with the ones that you\u2019re trying to teach here. So things are going to remain the same and no unnecessary risks. You\u2019ve managed to keep things together and not call attention to yourself with that rule and you\u2019re not changing it.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t give a shit what Zal calls you, you\u2019ll be letting Tom know the situation. Given how he feels about her, you\u2019ve no doubt that he\u2019ll side with you.\n\nLater you report to Tom just as you planned and also stress that you don\u2019t want to see Zal anywhere near the university since she\u2019s made it clear that she\u2019s going to do her own thing regardless of what you say. Tom thanks you for telling him this information and says he\u2019ll make sure that the university district is off limits to her and if he finds out otherwise, there will be severe consequences.\n\nHonestly, you don\u2019t have too much hope that Tom is going to really enforce that last rule. Over the course of the next few months your attention is partially directed towards thinking Zal is going to perform her activities to the university district anyway, but either she obeys the rules or she\u2019s more adept at keeping a low profile than you thought.\n\nEither way, there isn\u2019t some alarm raised on campus that is causing militia to start cracking down on the place. The rest of the Talons working under you don\u2019t give you any trouble, save for Sunshine and Flameflower on occasion and even they aren\u2019t that bad and eventually you do become somewhat lenient with them since it would seem they are more than capable of balancing their business with pleasure. You sort of wonder why they didn\u2019t just become prostitutes though seeing as they\u2019re doing as much fucking as they are stealing.\n\nAs for the rest of the Crimson Talons, things are business as usual elsewhere in the city, but then what do you really care? You\u2019re mostly divorced from those operations. Your slice of the pie is all you ever wanted and you still got that.\n\nYear 23\n\nYou hear a knock at your door. You really hope that isn\u2019t Virgil, you\u2019re not in the mood for his begging today. Elana makes her usual hostile squeaks until you tell her to calm down.\n\n\u201cWhat!? It\u2019s too fucking early to be banging on my door like this! The sun\u2019s not even setting!\u201d you yell.\n\u201cYeah well it\u2019s important. The boss man wants to see you.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cWha\u2026(sigh) hold on.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t expect this.\n\nYou get dressed as quickly as you can and open the door. Zal walks in and looks at Elana who is under a dresser and still giving the occasional angry squeak.\n\n\u201cUgh, that ugly thing still has way too many teeth.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cWhat the hell does Tom want and why would he send you of all people to come get me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHow should I know? He never tells me anything as you well know. And he probably sent me because it pleases him to send me on menial tasks like this. So you coming or what?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, just give me a few more moments.\u201d\n\nYou finish getting your gear and leave with Zalmora though you don\u2019t know why she\u2019s walking with you. You haven\u2019t directly interacted with her since last year.\n\n\u201cZal, you are aware that I know how to get to the Talon hideout right? You don\u2019t need to escort me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI know, but I sort of felt like we should talk along the way.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like arguing.\u201d\n\u201cWho said anything about arguing? I said talk. I feel like we drifted apart after the incident at the university.\u201d\n\u201cDid we? I didn\u2019t know we were so close.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe we weren\u2019t, but I still feel like we sort of took a wrong turn somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was when you weren\u2019t obeying my orders, accusing me of being a snitch, and then trying to manipulate me into killing Tom.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026okay\u2026I can see where you might have some feelings about that. And I didn\u2019t say you had to kill Tom, I mean I think you might have been able to convince him into stepping down. That would have been just as good.\u201d\n\u201cSure, either way you would have been leading from the shadows.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so against taking lead of the Crimson Talons. I mean yeah I get that you don\u2019t have any interest in leading and you like to play things safe and low key. I think that\u2019s not living up to your potential BUT I get it. Let me point out though, whether you intended to or not, you\u2019re actually a leader now. All those thieves that work directly with or under you? They speak highly of you, you know. I mean you have to know this right?\u201d\n\u201cGet to point Zal.\u201d\n\u201cMy point is, you\u2019re already half way there! Why not take the lead? The Crimson Talons could do better under you. I mean you\u2019d at least eliminate all this talk about possibly getting into the drug trade again.\u201d\n\u201cDrugs?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Jake and a few others want to get back into selling Yellow Devil. I\u2019m pretty against the idea obviously, but I can\u2019t deny that there wouldn\u2019t be benefits to the organization.\u201d\n\u201cWell what\u2019s Tom say?\u201d\n\u201cDunno, that might be what he wants to talk to you about. But again if he\u2019s asking you for advice on this matter, I think it would just be better if you were in charge to make the final decision on it.\u201d\n\nObviously Zalmora is still pushing for you to take control of the Crimson Talons and to you it\u2019s weird that she would still be attempting it. Even if you did, she has to know that you\u2019re aware of her agenda and wouldn\u2019t be a puppet.\n\nUnless it\u2019s something deeper than that, but\u2026no. She\u2019s teasingly flirted a few times, but it isn\u2019t like you and her have actually ever had anything together.\n\nYou and her are silent for a while until you\u2019re in the sewers and nearly to the hideout.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you really don\u2019t want to be head of the Crimson Talons?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cNot really, and if you lot are getting into drugs, I\u2019m thinking I might be gone altogether.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said you should just take power and shape this organization how you want it to be.\u201d\n\u201cZal, I\u2019m not your damn puppet. You want Tom gone, you do it yourself, then YOU could shape it how YOU want. Now just stop pushing me, because I\u2019m not interested.\u201d You snap.\n\u201cI see. My apologies for bothering you. I can see my advice was never desired or needed. I suppose I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d\n\nZalmora then nods to you and begins walking back the way you came. You watch her walk off and just shake your head wondering why you even joined this crazy organization in the first place. Though you\u2019re also wondering if you won\u2019t be leaving it soon.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wonder for long as something else happens that you didn\u2019t expect.\n\nBefore you even reach the hideout door, it opens and several Talon members come rushing out at you with weapons in hand. You\u2019re taken off guard and they soon knock you to the sewer muck and after kicking you around a bit, Jake comes out with a big axe in hand.\n\n\u201cAh, and now to deal with the second threat to the new regime. Pfft. Never liked you anyway. Always thought you were better than all of us, getting your own little section of the city to yourself, getting special treatment from Tom. Well that ends today.\u201d Jake remarks.\n\u201cWha\u2026where the hell is Tom?\u201d you utter while spitting up blood.\n\u201cGeez, thought Zal said you were smart. Then again you followed her here, guess you weren\u2019t too smart. Haven\u2019t you figured it out yet? He\u2019s fucking dead! Just like you soon will be. I\u2019m sure all those that worked with you will fall in line quick when they see your bloody head hanging on the wall.\u201d\n\nJake laughs a bit with the men loyal to him and doesn\u2019t waste any more words on you. He\u2019s here to kill you and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do and you\u2019re not going to stop him.\n\nThe last thing you see is the blade of an axe coming straight at your face.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Stay independent", "result": "The cons far outweigh the pros. You\u2019ve found your niche by plying most of your trade at the university district. You\u2019re staying out of the Talons way and more or less keeping a low profile from the militia. You see no good reason to change that.\n\nYou guess you\u2019ll have to become more of a \u201csalesman\u201d of sorts if you steal anything that isn\u2019t actual money though. You suppose the drugs you pilfer from the medical school won\u2019t be too hard to get a good price for or find buyers. Maybe it\u2019s time to branch out your skill set anyway. You are working on your own so you really need to be a jack-of-all-trades and try not to rely on outside sources. Especially since you still believe that the Crimson Talons are destined for nothing good in the future.\n\nThinking no more about it, you pack some of your tools in your bag and set off for the university.\n\nLater\u2026\n\nAfter picking a few random pockets, you pass by one of the bulletin boards to see if there are any big parties being announced in the near future (or even tonight) since those are always usually profitable to attend.\n\nYou take note of a couple listed and then you see a notice for a job.\n\nATTENTION!\n\nIn need of two people to assist in gathering several eggs from a Creptian Blueshell. Location will most likely be in the shores north of Hessla.\n\nTrip will be paid for and a reasonable monetary reward will be provided upon completion of the task.\n\nPlease see me in my office at the medical school for details if interested.\n\nDr. Gossey\n\nWhile you\u2019ve seen a few of these notices in the past since your last job with Dr. Gossey, you\u2019ve actually been reluctant to try it again for several reasons, but you\u2019re feeling a little adventurous. Might be good to get out of the city for a while anyway, because if that Zalmora woman comes around again to convince you to join, you might just be silly enough to do it.\n\nYou head over to the medical school and unlike last time you easily find Gossey\u2019s office without getting lost. (Though you sort of know this place fairly well by now considering all the medical paraphernalia you\u2019ve stolen from this place)\n\nWhen you arrive, you find that she\u2019s conveniently in her office. When she sees you she greets you warmly.\n\n\u201cWell, this is a surprise. I was wondering if we\u2019d ever bump into each other again. I haven\u2019t seen you since the last time you got those qweepas for me. I guess classes are keeping you busy?\u201d Gossey asks.\n\u201cYeah, I tend to study a lot, but anyway I\u2019m here about the job posting.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh good! I already got one person to help and since you did such a good job last time in acquiring the qweepas, I think I can safely hire you right away. Are you familiar with Creptain Blueshells?\u201d\n\u201cMm, not especially no.\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019re sort of like a cross between a snail and a crab, but about as big as a large dog. I mean they don\u2019t move very fast and they aren\u2019t usually overly aggressive in the scheme of things, but considering we need to take some eggs\u2026well I can guarantee they aren\u2019t going to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cI see. I don\u2019t suppose they sell these creatures as a delicacy in Hessla do they?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. They\u2019re far too poisonous to most life forms for that. In fact beside their shells, that\u2019s probably their number one defense. Don\u2019t let them spit on you.\u201d\n\u201cThey spit?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, but as I said, you\u2019ll have extra help this time. A student from the magic college is coming on the trip, along with my assistant Kelium. Between the three of you, I don\u2019t anticipate you\u2019ll have any problems as long as you remain cautious.\u201d\n\u201cMagic huh? Hmm, well that sounds like evening the odds a bit at least.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure, but I know this still has its danger, so it will be fifty gold upon completion. I\u2019d offer a little more, but the other student needs her payment too.\u201d\n\nFifty gold pieces is a nice chunk to go towards your secret savings. And as far as the crab snails monsters go, the wizard can probably handle the heavy lifting what with the fireballs and lightning and such.\n\n\u201cSounds reasonable. So when do we get going?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell since we have you now, I suppose I can get the trip going in three days. I\u2019ll explain to my assistant what you look like and you can just meet up with him at the carriage station in the morning. You\u2019ll probably have to stay in Hessla for the night when you reach it, but from there you should travel north along the coast to seek out the Creptians, but don\u2019t worry on that front, my assistant will have a map and I think you\u2019ll find Kelium much more agreeable than the last time you worked one of these jobs.\u201d Gossey remarks.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to hear. Did Elana graduate then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strangest thing. She never returned. I don\u2019t really want to think about what might have happened to her, but that\u2019s all in the past, and I\u2019m sure you did your best in trying to convince her that staying in Hessla alone ran a risk. Oh well, all in the past. But right now, all you have to do is make sure you get some of Creptian eggs. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d Gossey remarks.\n\nHaving come to an agreement with Dr. Gossey and her explaining what Kelium looks like along with the magic student Yvette, you take your leave of the university and head back home.\n\nYour next few days mainly consist of you preparing yourself for the trip. You pack your short sword, and a couple extra knives along with your flintlock. You also go and steal yourself some anti-venom from the apothecary. (Along with a few other items) You figure it can\u2019t hurt.\n\nFinally on the day you\u2019re supposed to meet everyone, you go to the carriage station and seek out your companions for this trip.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long when you see a tall pale man wearing a cap loading up a few bags on a carriage and near him is a shorter woman with light brown hair. You\u2019re guessing that\u2019s them. You also look at the driver and see that it isn\u2019t Yrid.\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re Yvette and Kelium right?\u201d you ask, and both of them turn to address you and confirm this question, then you announce who you are.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. More people to talk with on the trip.\u201d Kelium says easily hoisting another bag on top of the carriage with one arm.\n\u201cHi.\u201d Yvette says demurely.\n\nNot exactly what you expected. Kelium seems like less like a scholar and more like an athletic type. And you were expecting Yvette to be dressed in a robe or something similar. Maybe even holding a staff or something. At least neither are dressed screaming of \u201cHey I\u2019m rich, come rob and enslave me!\u201d though.\n\nAll three of you pile into the carriage, which is already better than last time. You and Kelium sit on one side while Yvette sits on the other and you\u2019re soon on your way.\n\nKelium talks for half of the trip and almost never shuts up. He goes on about his studies and how he\u2019s been helping Dr. Gossey and what he plans to do when he graduates. It probably would all be very fascinating if you actually cared. Still, at least he\u2019s pleasant enough and he\u2019s talking so much about himself he doesn\u2019t ask anything about you at all. You occasionally just give a general agreement with whatever he\u2019s saying.\n\nYvette is quiet and is just mainly listening to Kelium. She doesn\u2019t talk at all. Maybe wizards are just like that. All that isolated studying.\n\nEventually Kelium does shut up because he starts to get sleepy. He mentions that he was studying up on Blueshell Creptians all night just to be extra prepared. He then mentions for you two to wake him when you arrive in Hessla and soon he\u2019s fast asleep complete with snoring.\n\nYou take this opportunity to sit over on the other side of the carriage.\n\n\u201cUm. What are you doing?\u201d Yvette asks a bit suspiciously.\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting over here, because that snoring giant over there is taking up most of the room, not to mention he\u2019s loud enough even without being seated right next to him. I\u2019d like to reach Hessla and not be deaf in one ear.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cOh. Okay then.\u201d Yvette says and then gets over as far as she can when you sit down.\n\u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t trust me do you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm\u2026no, I mean yes. I mean um\u2026\u201d Yvette stutters.\n\u201cHah. It\u2019s okay. I understand being cautious, but I\u2019m really not going to do anything, I mean you\u2019re a wizard. I\u2019m not risking getting a spell cast on me.\u201d\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s not that! It\u2019s just well\u2026I\u2019m not used to being cramped in a small space like this with a bunch of people. I like a lot of personal space.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Got it. Also understand. You want me to go back and sit over there?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. You seem nice.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. Don\u2019t hear that one often. So I\u2019ve never met a wizard before. Tell me everything.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell and I\u2019m not really a wizard. I\u2019m still just an adept. I actually took this job as part of my own assignment of taking what I learned in the classroom and applying it to the field. I was sort of too nervous just to do it alone.\u201d\n\u201cWell it is a scary world out there at times.\u201d\n\nYou proceed to speak with Yvette for the rest of the trip who slowly starts to open up a bit. She goes on to tell you that the magic school isn\u2019t even all that big. She\u2019s only one of twenty-three students! Apparently the university is almost on the verge of closing it down since naturally magically talented individuals seem to be born less and less these days.\n\nHowever, magic is still a mighty force in this world and one of the Klyton Council members is a mage himself (Though not a particularly powerful one), so the school remains open.\n\nJust as you\u2019re starting to get Yvette to laugh at your dumb goblin jokes, you\u2019re arriving in Hessla and the driver stops.\n\n\u201cI guess we should wake up Kelium.\u201d Yvette says.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d You reply a bit disappointed. You were starting to enjoy your personal time with Yvette.\n\nWhile Yvette wakes him up, you get out to speak to the driver and ask him to take you to an inn that\u2019s better than the Barnacle.\n\n\u201cAnd DON\u2019T even fucking think about taking us to the Cozy Krak Inn!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t going to sir. I\u2019ve never even heard of the place. I was going to suggest going to the Sea Dog.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a slavers den?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no. It\u2019s run by an old ex-pirate and is more or less friendlier than most inns.\u201d\n\u201cIt better be.\u201d You say.\n\nYou get back in and see that Kelium is awake and the carriage soon takes you to your destination.\n\nThe Sea Dog is better than the Barnacle, but not by much. However, it at least isn\u2019t trying to appear like something it isn\u2019t. Kelium grabs all the supplies he packed, he doesn\u2019t even ask for help.\n\nThe ex-pirate that the driver mentioned reminds you of Trobart from the Welcome Mat because as soon as you enter he\u2019s glaring at you with his one good eye and asking what the hell you want.\n\nWhile you would probably return the verbal abuse, Kelium takes it all in stride and simply pays for the rooms. Unfortunately only two are available. Naturally it\u2019s decided that Yvette will take one room and you\u2019ll have to share one with Kelium. Not looking forward to that mostly because the guy snores so loudly.\n\nHowever as it turns out Kelium isn\u2019t ready to go to sleep.\n\n\u201cI partially slept on the way here, so I\u2019m wide awake! We should hang out and go find a proper tavern! Or better yet let\u2019s go find a gambling house! Dr. Gossey gave me all this money for the trip; I bet I can fucking double it!\u201d Kelium exclaims.\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you need to be alert for the trip north tomorrow?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine! Besides, we don\u2019t have to leave first thing in the morning. Come on, let\u2019s go have a little fun! This place has got to have less restrictions than Klyton!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I really think you should just stay put and try to get some rest. I mean I haven\u2019t slept so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome on man! You\u2019re not one of those guys that studies all the time are you? I mean I figure you took a job like this because you\u2019re an adventurous type! I mean yeah you got a job and I got an assignment, but shit, I ain\u2019t never been to a different town before. I wanna explore the scenery a bit! Maybe we can get Yvette to join us too! I saw you checking her out! She\u2019s a bit too quiet and bookish looking for me, but hey whatever you like man.\u201d\n\nOn one hand you don\u2019t really have anything against going out and spending someone else\u2019s money and maybe having some fun, but you also don\u2019t relish the idea of having to look after this fool because with his boisterousness you just know he\u2019s going to get himself into a whole mess of trouble and you already got monster crab snails to deal with tomorrow and EVERYONE needs to be prepared for that shit.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go party with Kelium", "result": "What the hell, might as well make this trip fun and he\u2019ll probably just leave anyway.

I doubt if this would be Yvette\u2019s thing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right, don\u2019t need her slowing us down. Okay! So where do you know that\u2019s a good place to go?\u201d Kelium remarks.\n\u201cWell we could try the Sultry Siren. That\u2019s usually the popular place.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! Lead the way.\u201d\n\nYou and Kelium head to the Sultry Siren, which is a lot busier than the last time you came here, then again the last time you were here, you weren\u2019t paying excessive attention to the environment.\n\nKelium immediately takes a liking to the place going on about how this was the sort of thing he was talking about. He orders drinks for the pair of you and wastes no time in wanting to get involved in one of the gambling games going on.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather go see one of the ladies they got here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe later. I wanna see if I can win some more money first, then I\u2019ll be able to pay more for special requests!\u201d Kelium says excitedly.\n\u201cUm, sure. I\u2019m gonna warn you though, a lot of these folks pretty serious about their gambling. I\u2019d say play a few times and then stop before you lose ALL your money.\u201d\n\u201cMe lose? Hardly. I\u2019m not unfamiliar with games of chance and it all comes down to probability! You just have to know the system and the beauty is, it isn\u2019t even cheating. I used to play private games against folks at the University all the time until everyone realized they would just be throwing their money away. These fools probably put all their misguided faith in Yag or whatever that silly deity of luck is called.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well you might also want to be careful if you intend on winning all the time too. In fact that might even be more dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBah, stop worrying! Here! Go get yourself the best, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d Kelium remarks and hands you a bunch of silvers as if it was nothing.\n\nYou quickly pocket them and briefly think about stopping Kelium since he\u2019s already throwing large amounts of money around like some clueless tourist. However you then remember you\u2019re supposed to be having fun and Kelium is a big boy and can probably handle himself.\n\nYou take your silver and indulge in the best looking whore the Sultry Siren has to offer. You have so much fun with Ariel that you lose track of time until she tells you to get out because you\u2019ve run out of coin.\n\nJust as well since you probably need to go check to see if Kelium has lost all his money yet.\n\nTo your surprise he wasn\u2019t joking about knowing \u201cthe system\u201d and he\u2019s up by at least a few hundred already.\n\n\u201cHey! You have as much fun as I\u2019ve been having? Here, go have some more fun!\u201d Kelium exclaims and shoves another pile of coins at you.\n\u201cThis is great and all, but don\u2019t you think you better stop? I mean it looks like you\u2019re ahead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo way, I\u2019m nowhere near finished yet! More drinks for everyone!\u201d\n\nWell it looks like Kelium is spreading the wealth around even though he\u2019s winning. Most people seem to be cheering him on. You see a few disgruntled folks perturbed about losing, but nobody looks like they\u2019re ready to kill him yet. In fact you\u2019re amazed it hasn\u2019t happened already given how much he\u2019s won.\n\nMaybe you were worried over nothing.\n\nYou take Kelium\u2019s coins and get yourself a few drinks before heading to see Ariel again.\n\nThis sort of merriment goes on for another few hours and by the time you\u2019re done with your third round of fun with Ariel (and a couple of her friends) you\u2019re only slightly less drunk than Kelium who is STILL winning despite the fact he shouldn\u2019t even be standing at this point.\n\nDespite your intoxicated state, you\u2019re still aware of your surroundings and now you\u2019re starting see less cheering and more glaring eyes of hatred. You think this would be the time to leave.\n\n\u201cKelium, (hic) it\u2019s getting a bit late, we got that thing to do tomorrow.\u201d You say, pulling at his arm.\n\u201cB\u2026b\u2026bbut I haven\u2019t\u2026be\u2026begun\u2026(hic) to havffffun yet!

He can\u2019t just leave without letting us have a chance of winning back our money.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cPfft, wouldn\u2019t matter anyway. I\u2019ve been watching this asshole all night and while I can\u2019t prove it, I KNOW he\u2019s gotta be cheating. There\u2019s some magic shit going on or something maybe.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cHey waitaminute, maybe it\u2019s THIS guy who\u2019s been in control the whole night! Maybe this guy is an illusion or something.\u201d a third says.\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s redic\u2026(hic) ulous. I\u2019ve been spending all my time with the ladies in the back the whole time! I\u2019m not a damn wizard!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nUnfortunately the men aren\u2019t convinced and begin advancing on you. You back away, and tell them they can take all the money, but Kelium really isn\u2019t keen on that idea even in his near passed out state.\n\n\u201cWhaaaaa!? (hic) Fuck dat! Haf at you!\u201d he says and clumsily tries to draw his sword.\n\nThis is a very bad move and the men waste no time in turning this situation into what might have been just a beat down, into a stabby bad time.\n\nKelium is instantly run through by the time he draws his blade, then he\u2019s knocked to the floor dead.\n\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d you say and start to run.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you\u2019d probably be able to get away, but you\u2019re just not in the best coordinated condition and you end up barely getting out the door before one of the gamblers trips you up and you go sprawling to the ground.\n\nYou feel a crushing blow to your head, which is then followed by someone roughly turning you over.

My father has to bust his ass making my tuition payments!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026in any case. I\u2019ve been to this town before and its reputation is well earned. There are people here that make the dregs of Klyton look like priests of Joachim and if you run afoul of them, it isn\u2019t going to be good for you.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I can handle trouble.\u201d Kelium says and flexes his muscles a bit and pulls a sword out of his bag.\n\u201cYeah, maybe you could handle one person, but the problem is these sort don\u2019t travel alone, they ALWAYS travel in packs and I can honestly say that YOU are not going to handle five or even three by yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWell wouldn\u2019t you help me? I mean isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\u201cYour job or assignment is to get some monster crab eggs. MY job is to help you in that task. My job is NOT however looking after your ass while you look for fun or trouble. Now I suggest you get some rest which is what I\u2019m going to do because giant snail monsters that spit poison sound like they need full attention.\u201d\n\nYou fully expect Kelium to argue some more with you, but he doesn\u2019t. You also expect him to just leave the room by himself, but he doesn\u2019t do that either thankfully. He just says he thought you were going to be fun and starts reading through some of his papers.\n\nFeeling a little pleased with yourself, you lay down on your bed and attempt to get to sleep before Kelium genuinely starts to get tired again, because if he starts snoring there is no way you\u2019re going to get any sleep.\n\nMuch later, you groggily wake up and find that your speech was less effective than you thought.\n\nKelium is not in your room. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even look like his bed has been slept in. You just shake your head and groan.\n\n\u201cStupid fucker probably got himself enslaved or his throat cut.\u201d you mutter, as you get yourself prepared to go look for this idiot.\n\nThe first stop you make is Yvette\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cHey Yvette.\u201d You say knocking on the door.\n\u201cUm\u2026yes?\u201d she answers, but not opening the door.\n\u201cIs Kelium in there?\u201d\n\u201cNo, why would he be? What are you implying?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what? Nothing! I\u2019m just asking because he\u2019s gone, and it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s slept in his bed either. I\u2019m guessing he took off to have fun in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear. Um\u2026well hold on, I have to get ready. I\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d Yvette says.\n\nYou half wonder if Kelium is in there and he\u2019s climbing out of a window. If that is the case, it\u2019s going to be real obvious if he and Yvette slept together last night. You aren\u2019t sure why Yvette would bother hiding it though; it isn\u2019t like you really give a shit.\n\nAs it turns out however, that isn\u2019t the case at all and you don\u2019t even have far to go to find Kelium.\n\nYou find him just outside the Sea Dog, stripped nearly naked and lying unconscious by the street.\n\n\u201cWell, at least that\u2019s one less thing to worry about.\u201d You say to yourself and begin the undesirable task of dragging his ass back inside. It\u2019s sometime at this point, Kelium begins to rouse from his unconsciousness.\n\nIn between the name-calling and laughter by the locals, you manage to get him back to the room where Yvette joins you both.\n\nKelium has a wicked hang over, but manages to explain what he remembers. He says that after you fell asleep he went out to explore the town and soon found himself in a card game at some place that he can\u2019t remember the name of. He claims he was winning and also says that someone must have drugged his drink and robbed him of everything.\n\n\u201cI told you not to go out. You\u2019re just lucky that getting robbed blind was all that happened to you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, fuck. You sound like some old bitch. Shit. My head. Alright fine. Just let me get my spare clothes, and we can go get these fucking eggs.\u201d Kelium says.\n\u201cWait, we\u2019re going now? Are you in condition to do this? Maybe we should wait a day.\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fucking fine! Besides, I just lost all my money. We can\u2019t afford to stay here another night. We need to get these eggs today and then get the fuck outta this shitty town.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t even ask HOW you\u2019re supposed to get back to Klyton if he\u2019s lost all his money. Though you\u2019ve brought a little with you, so you suppose you\u2019ll be footing the carriage bill. Like Yvette, you aren\u2019t sure if Kelium is in the best condition to go do this, but you\u2019re certainly not going to be paying for more time at the inn either, so if he thinks he\u2019s good to go, then you are too. Besides, you\u2019re going to be happy when this is over with and you\u2019re questioning why you ever decided to do this again.\n\n\u201cAdventurous\u2026I should have that drunk Virgil check me for demonic possession.\u201d You mutter.\n\nAfter Kelium gets dressed and gathers his supplies (Which at least he\u2019s carrying), the three of you set off on your journey to get these eggs. Unfortunately, its not just a simple matter of sticking to the coast and finding them along the shore, Kelium says you\u2019ll probably have to go into a cave seeing as they like to lay their eggs some place dark, wet and safe.\n\n\u201cUm, we have to enter a cave?\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Kelium asks.\n\nWhat Yvette doesn\u2019t answer right away, you step in.\n\n\u201cI think Yvette is a bit uncomfortable with small spaces, especially dark ones crawling with monsters.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHuh? Well that\u2019s just tough because she signed up for this task voluntarily. Nobody held a flintlock to her head. Besides, it\u2019s most likely a big open cave given how large blueshell creptians are.\u201d Kelium remarks.\n\u201cOh, well that changes everything.\u201d\n\nYou travel a bit longer until you start climbing up a small hill. Kelium occasionally looks at the ground and tries to find signs of creptians. He seems to know what he\u2019s doing, despite his condition, though at this point you\u2019re more on the look out of other potential bad types like say bandits or something similar. Meanwhile Yvette looks like she\u2019s expecting trouble everywhere since she\u2019s looking around constantly.\n\n\u201cYvette, calm yourself. Out of the three of us, you\u2019ve probably got the most power here to deal with anything.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI dunno what you think I can do. I know. I\u2019m not some high mage like in the old stories. As I told you, I\u2019m just starting out and I haven\u2019t even been out of the city before.\u201d\n\u201cHm, so you can\u2019t just summon a ball of flame or shoot lighting?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026well not what you\u2019re probably thinking. I mean maybe I could conjure a small palm sized ball of flame. Not sure if that would take down a Blueshell Creptian though, and it takes all my focus just to do it.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than nothing I suppose.\u201d\n\nSuddenly you hear Kelium yelling about something. You were so busy speaking with Yvette you didn\u2019t even notice Kelium disappeared\u2026again.\n\n\u201cHEY COME HELP ME! SHIT!\u201d Kelium shouts.\n\nYou and Yvette run over to the other side of the hill you were on and see Kelium with his sword in hand and scrambling for cover behind a rock. You also see what you can only guess is a blueshell creptian. It looks exactly how you pictured. A big snail, with big crab like claws and a blue shell.\n\nNearby the creptian you see a large sloping hole in the ground, you can only imagine that\u2019s where it has made its home.\n\n\u201cHEY! MOVE IN MAN! ATTACK!\u201d You hear Kelium shout as a glob of blueshell spit hits the rock he\u2019s hiding behind.\n\nYou pull out your flintlock and fire at the blueshell and find that the shot doesn\u2019t even penetrate its hard shell. In fact it doesn\u2019t even turn its attention to you, so far it\u2019s just slowly crawling over to Kelium\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cYvette, can you cast some sort of light spell or cause something to glow?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, but how is that going to help?\u201d Yvette says.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll help me search that cave for the eggs while it\u2019s distracted.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going in there alone? What happens if there\u2019s another one in there?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be running out of there really quick I guess. You just try to distract that blueshell and when I get the eggs we can all get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I think maybe we should try to work together to kill the blueshell, then deal with the cave.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to, or at least not with what we got. Look, I\u2019m going to be as quick as I can. All you have to do is stay away from that thing and find some cover. It doesn\u2019t move that fast.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d\n\nObviously Yvette has some doubt about this plan and if she does there\u2019s a chance she could panic, but you really don\u2019t have confidence in her plan either especially since it means you\u2019d have to get closer or at least aim for a place that isn\u2019t armor plated.", "action_results": [{"action": "Proceed with your plan", "result": "It might seem slightly cowardly on your part, but you\u2019re not a damn massive warrior, you sneak about and steal shit. You\u2019re playing to your real strengths, which isn\u2019t going head to head with some big ass armored monster.\n\n\u201cYvette, look this is going to work. I\u2019ll go grab the eggs and you just try to help Kelium. And if shit starts getting too much for you, I want you to just run back to Hessla. There is no damn point in all of us dying.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut nothing, you just have to trust me on this. I\u2019ll be fine, I just need to see in that cave, so cast whatever spell you need to, to make that happen.\u201d\n\nYvette is reluctant, but your words and the urgency of the situation causes her to comply. She says some sort of weird shit and moves her hands about and then suddenly a little ball of light appears in front of you.\n\n\u201cThat will follow you around and should last quite awhile, but you still need to hurry!\u201d Yvette exclaims and then starts casting another spell.\n\nYou don\u2019t waste any time running down towards the blueshell lair. The creature still doesn\u2019t notice you, but you certainly hear Kelium shouting at you about what you think you\u2019re doing.\n\nYou enter the blueshell dwelling and your boots are immediately covered in some sort of slime that the monster no doubt left. It smells pretty bad in here, but it isn\u2019t like the stench of something rotten, it\u2019s more like a strong chemical smell that burns your nostrils.\n\nThe deeper you go, the more slime there is and the stronger the smell, you\u2019re practically gagging at this point. Whether there is another blueshell in here or not isn\u2019t going to matter much longer because you\u2019re about to leave before you become overwhelmed by just the smell.\n\nThen that\u2019s when you get lucky and spot something that you guess are eggs. They look oval shaped and seem to have a hard shell so that\u2019s good enough for you. You grab as many as you can and shove them into your bag. You\u2019re really going to have to bathe after this.\n\nWith the eggs in the bag you run out of this foul cave as quick as you can partially vomiting the whole time. In fact you actually start to feel like you\u2019re going to pass out and that\u2019s when you start to wonder if this slime on your hands from the eggs isn\u2019t also poisonous. You wipe them as much as you can on your clothing and soldier on. Just as the little ball of light that\u2019s following you starts to go out, you see the light of the outside and then you also see a sizable fire and smoke. You were so busy with your task, you sort of blocked out the distant sounds of the battle outside.\n\nUpon exiting the cave, the smell hasn\u2019t improved, though now charred crepitan flesh is filling the air. Small fires burn on the sparse grass and you see the burning carcass of the creptian. Whatever power Yvette didn\u2019t think she was capable of she was clearly wrong.\n\nYou hear some sobbing which you can only guess is her, you follow the sound and see her sitting on the ground with her face in her hands.\n\n\u201cYvette? What\u2026What\u2019s going on? I certainly hope you aren\u2019t crying because killed that thing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo! (sob) I\u2019m crying because I didn\u2019t kill it quick enough! Look over there!\u201d Yvette shouts and points to a body not lying too far away.\n\nYou walk over and see Kelium and he\u2019s completely blue. He was hit face first with the spit (He\u2019s got translucent blue goo all over his head) and whatever happened afterwards obviously took effect immediately. His face is twisted in a manner that its very apparent his death was pretty painful.\n\nStill feeling a bit sick yourself, you quickly take some of the anti-venom you bought. You just hope it helps and you aren\u2019t slowly dying. You go back over to Yvette who is still upset.\n\n\u201cYvette, it\u2019s bad what happened, but it really isn\u2019t your fault. I mean this was a dangerous job, any one of us could have died. I mean you killed the beast which means you have more power than you thought you did, that should count for something right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cBut what about Kelium? I mean we were supposed to keep him safe! What are we going to do?\u201d Yvette answers.\n\u201cOkay, first off, you don\u2019t even need to worry about it. I know how to handle Dr. Gossey. I know it\u2019s going to sound strange, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to be as upset as you are. But I do have to ask, what exactly was your assignment?\u201d\n\u201cJust to practice my magic in the field and report the results. They have a way to tell if I\u2019m lying or not.\u201d\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t need to cut off a piece of that burning crab snail as proof then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll get marked down for being the cause of someone\u2019s death during my assignment.\u201d\n\u201cYvette, you need to put that guilt out of your mind. Seriously. Kelium\u2019s death wasn\u2019t your fault. It really wasn\u2019t. To be honest, if Kelium hadn\u2019t gone out and gotten himself wasted last night, this whole expedition might have gone a little more cautiously. Under the circumstances I\u2019d say we did the best we could have done. Just tell them you tried to be the voice of reason. All of this has truth to it, you just have to know how to spin it and you have to believe it yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026dunno\u2026I just wasn\u2019t brought up that way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course you weren\u2019t, but there really isn\u2019t a good reason why you should possibly suffer a lowered grade because other people fucked up right? Come on, let\u2019s get back to Hessla, I\u2019ll go over everything with you along with way there and on the way back to Klyton. I want to head over to the shoreline though and wash this slime off first though.\u201d\n\nYou spend your remaining time with Yvette going over the fine art of \u201ctelling the truth.\u201d Again, it\u2019s silly to you anyway, because she REALLY didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she\u2019s just blaming herself. However, if it\u2019s going to help calm her when she has to go before this magical lie detector then you don\u2019t mind helping. Not like she deserves getting a bad grade.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re taking the carriage ride back to Klyton, you\u2019re feeling a little better. You guess you\u2019re not dying of blueshell poison, then again it just got on your hands, you didn\u2019t get a load of the stuff in your face like Kelium did.\n\nAt some point you fall asleep on the trip to Klyton and Yvette wakes you up when you arrive.\n\n\u201cHey, wake up, we need to switch carriages to go to the university.\u201d Yvette says.\n\u201cHuh? Wha? It\u2019s night.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, but we should still get to the university a little after midnight. Should be enough time to get some sleep before seeing Dr. Gossey. Of course I also have to go before my professor to give my report too. What\u2019s on your agenda?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026nothing. No classes. In fact I\u2019m not heading to the university.\u201d\n\u201cWait you don\u2019t live on campus?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Nah, I prefer keeping my personal life and school a bit separate in that regard.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I see. Where do you live?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nowhere special really\u2026so hey I have an idea, why don\u2019t you just worry about your wizard report tomorrow. Like I said, I\u2019ll go see Dr. Gossey and talk to her about what happened. I\u2019ve worked for her before and I know exactly what to say, she\u2019ll understand, trust me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still nervous about the report.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine. Just keep in mind what I said. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and have nothing to feel guilty about.\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what else to do to alleviate her fears, so you just go for it and kiss her on the lips before she can even do anything about it. She\u2019s in shock and pushes you back.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what?! Why\u2019d you do that for?!\u201d she exclaims.\n\u201cI dunno. I like you\u2026and you still seemed to be worried so I did the only thing I could think of that calm you.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?! That\u2019s what you thought? You think I\u2019m just some empty headed damsel that\u2019s going to fall for all the honeyed words you\u2019ve been telling me since we\u2019ve been on this trip? I know how you\u2019ve been looking at me; I\u2019m not stupid you know! In fact you\u2019re right this ISN\u2019T my fault! It\u2019s YOURS! If we had worked together as a team, Kelium might very well have lived!\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck\u2026forget it. I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t turn me into a toad.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to, you obviously already have the manners of one!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Okay\u2026I\u2019m just gonna leave. Good luck on your report.\u201d You say and just take you leave before Yvette can continue yelling at you.\n\nWell that could have gone better. You just couldn\u2019t help it though; you thought her whole modest demeanor was cute and alluring, probably because you don\u2019t encounter many girls like that. Maybe it was for the best though, not like you would have had much of a future with a girl like that.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re going home with a bag of slimy monsters eggs. You push Virgil out of the way when you get to the Welcome Mat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in no mood, you fucking drunk.\u201d You say and slam the door behind you.\n\u201cSheesh, you\u2019re very emotional.\u201d You hear him retort.\n\nYou collapse on the bed and sleep. (At some point in the night, Elana curls up by your feet.)\n\nLater\u2026\n\nYou wake up and immediately make your way to the university. You sort of hope you don\u2019t bump into Yvette, because you\u2019d rather not get into that mess again.\n\nAfter an uneventful trip, you get to Dr. Gossey\u2019s office where you see her writing something out.\n\n\u201cHey, that was quicker than I thought! I trust you have the eggs in that bag?\u201d\n\u201cYep, but careful, they still got some of that poisonous slime on them, you can just take the whole bag. No way I\u2019m getting that clean again.\u201d You say and place it on a table.\n\u201cNot surprised. Hope you didn\u2019t get sick\u2026but I guess if you\u2019re here then you must have had the forethought to prepare yourself. Um\u2026where is my assistant and the other one?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Yvette had to give a report to her wizard professors, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll show up here later to collect her coin. As for Kelium\u2026well\u2026\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Damn. I guess I should ask how it happened.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak ill of the dead\u2026but he wasn\u2019t exactly careful. I tried to tell him not to directly attack the blueshell and that the eggs were good enough, but he really wanted to impress you by bringing back one alive. He didn\u2019t really think that out however and well to make a long story short, he got himself killed and if it hadn\u2019t been for Yvette\u2019s magic, I probably would have died too. It was terrible.\u201d\n\nDr. Gossey shakes her head.\n\n\u201cSounds like Kelium. He always was eager to impress and please. I always told him safety should always take priority. Certainly a loss, but at least you got the eggs, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nAnd of course just like you figured, Gossey\u2019s concern was more about the goal than the lives involved in it. You take your fifty gold and once again leave a bit richer.\n\nYou know exactly how you\u2019re going to spend some of it too. You leave the university and head to Madam Moonlight\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in awhile, will you be having your usual?\u201d the elven madam asks.\n\u201cUm, no not today. Got kind of a special request this time.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell if you got the coin and it doesn\u2019t involve killing someone, we can probably accommodate.\u201d\n\nYou explain in some detail about what you want exactly and the madam says that\u2019s a simple request and thought you were going to ask for something elaborate like an orc hermaphrodite to shit and piss on you while you sucked a centaur cock.\n\n\u201cWhat?! NO! That\u2019s disgusting! Why the hell would anyone want that?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, we cater to all types here. Don\u2019t judge.\u201d Moonlight scolds.\n\u201cLook whatever, just set me up and no horse cocks or shitting orc freaks!\u201d\n\nAfter a few minutes the Moonlight comes back to take you to your girl. You enter the room and see a short woman with light brown hair dressed in a robe.\n\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Yana and I need you to help me complete my spell ritual. I need your wand in my magic circle\u2026\u201d The woman says while seductively walking over to you.\n\u201c(Sigh) NO. Your name is Yvette and you\u2019re shy. Not some fucking aggressive trollop! Got it?\u201d you order.\n\u201cOkay okay, got it! Sheesh, you\u2019re very emotional.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\n\u201cLook, I dunno anything about what that old bastard does in his spare time, I just pay my rent and mind my own business.\u201d You say.\n\nThe militiamen give you a look like they don\u2019t quite believe you.\n\n\u201cJust an innocent in all this eh? Bullshit. Trobart says you\u2019re a rogue through and through.\u201d One of them remarks.\n\u201cYeah, and one of your neighbors, Randi I believe? She says you even have ties to the Crimson Talons.\u201d Another adds.\n\nYou nearly want to laugh, but you resist since you don\u2019t want to piss off the militia unnecessarily.\n\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re going to believe a whore and some guy that sells alcohol illegally in his basement? They\u2019re just trying to save their own asses by making false accusations! You turned my room upside down and didn\u2019t find ANY stolen goods. And if I was a Crimson Talon, do you really think I\u2019d be living in the shithole that I\u2019m currently living in?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say you were a Crimson Talon, just said you had ties to them. And if you think just because we didn\u2019t catch you with anything that you\u2019re off the hook. You deny that you\u2019re a criminal, but as I said, it\u2019s obvious that you have no visible means of support, so you have to be doing something illegal.\u201d A militia officer says.\n\u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t have a proper job? You\u2019re just making baseless assumptions.\u201d\n\u201cAm I now? I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re just some second rate pissant sneak thief that is so pathetic at your own lowly trade that you managed to avoid our eye for so long. In fact I can imagine you probably TRIED to join the Crimson Talons, but they just kept you on as an associate bitch because you weren\u2019t good enough to be a real member.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting theory. Is this going somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE going to be going somewhere if you don\u2019t shut the fuck up and listen closely to my offer!\u201d the militia officer exclaims, getting in your face.\n\nYou sit back in your chair and remain silent. The militia officer continues to stare at you assessing your every tell your face might be giving off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this criminal scum. You\u2019re on our fucking list now. I\u2019ve got your name, I\u2019ve got your ass. Your best bet would be to just get the fuck out of this city, but I know you. You probably think you\u2019re smarter than me. Well you ain\u2019t and you\u2019re gonna get caught. Maybe not now. Maybe not even next year, but you WILL fuck up. And when you do, I\u2019m going to make sure they put you in the smallest hanging cage we got. Believe that.\u201d\n\nThe militia officer then pulls back a bit and adopts a less combative stance along with a calmer voice.\n\n\u201cNow, all that being said\u2026we do have bigger fish to catch and if you did\u2026 say have ties to the Crimson Talons then MAYBE you might know where their hideout is. If you helped us with something like that, then well maybe I might be inclined to not keep such a close eye on you.\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s times like these that make being a criminal not so much fun, though honestly as the years have been going on, you\u2019re starting to wonder why you ever thought it was fun in the first place.\n\nYou haven\u2019t really much contact with the Crimson Talons since Zalmora visited you that one day asking you to join. All you did hear is that Tom isn\u2019t in charge anymore and was killed by one of the more aggressive members who took over. Word says he\u2019s a real tyrannical asshole, which might explain why none of the Talon members that have gotten arrested haven\u2019t actually ratted on him themselves.\n\nIt also explains when you have bumped into a couple of their members randomly in the taverns, they\u2019ve been less than friendly and warned you to stay out of their territory. (Which you most certainly have been doing for years now)\n\nYou do know that their headquarters is still in the same location. You don\u2019t know why the militia doesn\u2019t know where it is though given how they\u2019ve increased their own activity as of late. The militia can be remarkably blind at times.\n\n\u201cLook, if I did have dealings with the Crimson Talons, I\u2019d help you out, but I just don\u2019t associate with such people. Apologies.\u201d You say.\n\nThe militia officer doesn\u2019t look pleased by your answer, and you sort of wonder if he\u2019s going to end up throwing you in jail anyway, but he lets you go.\n\n\u201cOkay then, but remember I gave you an out today and you turned it down. Be seeing you soon criminal.\u201d\n\nYou get up from the chair you\u2019ve been sitting on for who knows how long and walk out the door, though not before one of the militia shoves the back of your head. It\u2019s frustrating, but any dealing with the militia that you walk away from is a victory.\n\nFrom the militia barracks you make your way back to the Welcome Mat, which is practically destroyed at this point. At least it is on the inside. The law-abiding inhabitants (Or at least the criminal ones that didn\u2019t get caught) are busily trying to gather and clean up the mess the militia made of their homes. You imagine Trobart, even with his ratting bullshit on you isn\u2019t going to be able to keep this place any longer.\n\nYou enter your own ruined room where upon Elana comes out from whatever hole in the wall she was hiding in and squeaks at you.\n\n\u201cHey Elana, glad to see they didn\u2019t get you girl. Now let\u2019s hope they didn\u2019t get anything else either.\u201d\n\nYou find a chair that wasn\u2019t destroyed and check the hiding spot you have in the ceiling of your room. After checking and pulling out your small locked container you breathe a sigh of relief. Your small savings are still intact.\n\nYou\u2019ll be needing it too, because everything else was taken. Your weapons, your tools, everything that you use or need in your profession. Granted it wasn\u2019t a lot, but it\u2019s still a loss. You\u2019ll also be needing to find a new place to live.\n\nAs you\u2019re pondering your next move, your door with the broken lock opens up. It\u2019s Virgil and he appears to be sober for a change.\n\n\u201cDamn, they really did a number on yer room too I see.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still my fucking room. What the hell do you want, I don\u2019t have any money so you can go get drunk.\u201d you say.\n\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t askin\u2019. Sheesh, I was just coming in here to see if you were around. I wanted to apologize for bothering you all the time for money actually.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I mean I dunno if you noticed but I haven\u2019t been around as much lately.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I did notice a reduction in our usual encounters over the past month.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get my life back together. Get myself right with Joachim again. Part of that is me apologizing and trying to make amends for all the times I bothered you.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? You got a bag full of coins for all the times I gave you money for booze?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I wish I did. I know how you like money\u2026I might even give you a lecture about that, but I\u2019m not really in any position to do so. I first need to get myself right with Joachim and then I might be able to guide others into his light like I was supposed to be doing in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if you preaching at me is any better than you hitting me up for booze money.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure to you it isn\u2019t, but I\u2019m here to apologize anyway and if there is something within my power to help you, just let me know.\u201d\n\u201cWell, thanks I suppose. Can\u2019t really think of anything I need from you though, unless you got an idea of a new cheap place to live at that isn\u2019t completely a shithole.\u201d\n\u201cNot really, unless you want to sleep in one of the poor rooms at the Church of Joachim. That\u2019s sort of where I\u2019ve been staying lately. Would have been living there before, if I hadn\u2019t gotten asked to leave for my...weakness. Guess I might be living there for good now. Just as well. It was time to move on.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work out for me, but thanks for the offer.\u201d\n\nVirgil nods and then says something about Joachim\u2019s blessing be upon you.\n\nYou finish packing up and when you\u2019re only a few steps away from the Welcome Mat, it suddenly occurs to you. Your family\u2019s old inn. It\u2019s still abandoned. You could easily stay there and that would at least save you some of the costs.\n\n\u201cShould have thought about that in the first place.\u201d You say and make your way to the inn. Of course as you begin to do so, you realize you\u2019re being followed. That officer wasn\u2019t fucking around when he said he was going to have eyes on you all the time.\n\nIt takes some time, but you end up losing them, but now you\u2019re practically on the other side of the city! If this is how it\u2019s always going to be, it\u2019s not going to matter where you stay.\n\nMaybe it is time to leave Klyton, which you suppose you don\u2019t mind since things haven\u2019t been the greatest here, but you just hate being chased off like this.\n\nOf course there\u2019s always the option the officer suggested.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any loyalty to the Talons, so if it did help you out in the long run, well it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world. It might even help you with less competition around that is actually making it harder for everyone else. Ever since the change in leadership, the Talons have also been selling Yellow Devil which has been causing a bit of a minor crime wave, what with all the extra junkies running around causing problems. (Even at your stomping grounds, the University)\n\nOf course being a rat is a pretty damn serious offense in the criminal world (Even if it goes on all the time) and if the Crimson Talons ever did find out, it probably wouldn\u2019t go well for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Klyton", "result": "You\u2019re a lot of things, but you ain\u2019t no rat. Besides, it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s going to make a difference anyway except maybe getting yourself killed if word got out.\n\nYour best bet is to seek greener pastures so to speak. Without another thought you make your way to the carriage station.\n\nHolgard comes to mind, but there's always some sort of rebellion or power struggle going on there. You'd rather not have to deal with being in the middle of that mess. The Delantium Kingdom is at war with some other nation, so you'd rather avoid the possibility of suddenly getting press ganged or conscripted into military service.\n\nThe only other place is Hessla, which at least you\u2019re somewhat familiar with. The trip to Hessla is uneventful and when you arrive the same power structure is in place. Tolen is still the governor and his Headsmen provide the order. At least some things remain consistent.\n\nAfter spending a few days in Hessla you realize you\u2019re going to have to find some more reliable way of earning coin because thievery here is too high risk with low reward. Most people here aren\u2019t exactly rolling in coins. Shops are always well protected so is anyone who does have a lot. At best you might get a pirate that\u2019s flush with ill gotten loot, but you\u2019d probably have to get one right off the ship because they spend it like water.\n\nNot to mention the Headsmen are probably more vicious than the militia. They might not be as observant, but they don\u2019t need to be. Unlike you, folks here tend to have no qualms about ratting out thieves where upon the Headsmen deal out swift justice.\n\nYou need to find something suited to your skills.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is piracy given that you\u2019re here in the heart of it. Granted you\u2019re no sailor and you have little knowledge on what exactly is involved, but it is something you imagine your trade might come in handy.\n\nNot really knowing how this is done, you head to one of the docks looking for work.\n\nFirst one you try is a big dark skinned bald man who is standing by a large ship with several cannons mounted in it. He looks intimidating, and seems more surprised that you even approached him rather than annoyed.\n\n\u201cUm, you lost landlubber?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cLandlubber?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely you. You ain\u2019t a sailor and you sure as hell aren\u2019t a pirate.\u201d\n\u201cThat obvious?\u201d\n\u201cGiven that you even approached me, you might as well be wearing a sign. So whadda ya want?\u201d\n\u201cI want to be a pirate.\u201d\n\nThe man stares at you in disbelief for a moment and looks you up and down before laughing heartily.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a little old to be having dreams of running away to be a pirate? Get the fuck outta here.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not that old, I\u2019m probably younger than you. And what difference does it make how old I am?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this here is the Dominator and as I already pointed out, you\u2019re no sailor and we ain\u2019t got time to train you and you\u2019re not nearly young enough to act as a tag along cabin boy. The pirate shit is easy. Any thug off the street could be one. But bein\u2019 a sailor? THAT\u2019S the hard part.\u201d\n\u201cAre you the captain of this ship then?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I\u2019m Zamed, the first mate. The captain of this fine vessel is Captain Illam and he\u2019s less tolerant than I am so you\u2019re not going to see him at all.\u201d\n\u201cI have skills! I can fight! I mean I\u2019m an accomplished thief! I\u2019m very stealthy! I can pick almost any lock\u2026ANY lock if given enough time!\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s not really helping you. Last thing we need is someone on our ship potentially sneaking around and pilfering hard earned loot. And as for yer fighting skills, I doubt if you were doing too much of that if you were sneaking about. I\u2019d wager you wouldn\u2019t be much good in a boarding action or a coastal raid. You even know what its like to be in a real fight and so close to a man that when you stick your blade into him that you can smell death upon him?\u201d Zamed says getting in your face and staring you down.\n\n\u201cActually I do.\u201d You say staring up at Zamed.\n\nZamed continues to study you and then slowly moves back to his original position.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026so maybe you might qualify in that regard, but that still doesn\u2019t mean shit. As I said, we only take on skilled sailors and I KNOW you aren\u2019t one of those.\u201d\n\u201cBut how am I going to learn how to be a sailor if I don\u2019t get any on experience?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, not mine.\u201d\n\u201cBah, this is bullshit.\u201d You say and start to walk away, but Zamed calls to you.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t normally do this, but since you even had the balls to approach me I\u2019ll help you out. You see those docks over there? Go over to that ship and ask if they\u2019re looking for any new crew. The captain has lower standards on his ship, he might accept you.\u201d Zamed says.\n\u201cThat big one over there?\u201d\n\u201cHah. No, that one is Captain Yan\u2019s vessel, and you\u2019re not getting on that one. She only accepts women. You want the smaller one. The Steadfast run by Captain Rifiv.\u201d\n\u201cFigures.\u201d\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s your best shot if you\u2019re serious about this life. Besides, don\u2019t let the looks fool you. It\u2019s not called the Steadfast for nothing. Rifiv might be well past his prime, but back in his day he was nothing to sneeze at. He\u2019s probably lived longer than most his contemporaries. Anyway good luck I guess.\u201d\n\nYou leave Zamed and head to the Steadfast. If this doesn\u2019t work out, you aren\u2019t sure what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\nWhen you get near the vessel, you see a group milling around it just talking with each other. Several of them notice you approach and one addresses you.\n\n\u201cLooking for something?\u201d a scruffy man wearing a rag on his head asks.\n\u201cThis is the Steadfast right? I want to join the crew.\u201d You say.\n\nThey all look at each other and then the scruffy man addresses you again.\n\n\u201cYou got any skills?\u201d he asks.\n\nYou go on about your abilities the same way you did to Zamed. They don\u2019t look too impressed either, but they don\u2019t look disappointed either.\n\n\u201cHmm, well we\u2019ve certainly had less skilled people on this vessel. We weren\u2019t actively looking for anyone new though. However, the captain doesn\u2019t tend to mind a few extra hands, so you might get lucky. Come on, let me just go take you to him. The name\u2019s Scully by the way.\u201d\n\nYou follow Scully up the gangplank and wait as he knocks on the door of what you guess is the captain\u2019s cabin. He gets an answer to come in and after a couple minutes, Scully comes back out and tell you to come in as well.\n\nThat\u2019s when you meet this Captain Rifiv. He's practically an old man who is having a hard time walking with a cane. He's dressed better than everyone else on the ship, but that isn't saying much since even his fancy overcoat has patches sewn on it.\n\n\u201cSo Scully says you want to join up. Also tells me your primary background was as a small time thief in Klyton and you have NO experience on the sea at all. That correct?\u201d Captain Rifiv says.\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWhile the premise is still in the same family of taking other people\u2019s shit, you do realize being a pirate is a lot different than what you\u2019re used to right?\u201d\n\u201cI do, but I\u2019m willing to learn.\u201d\n\u201cBetter learn quickly then, because if you fall behind or I don\u2019t think you\u2019re pulling your weight then I\u2019ll have you chopped up and thrown overboard for mermaid food. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cClearly.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll see then. Scully show him where he\u2019ll be sleeping and everything else. And after you\u2019re finished doing that, gather the rest of the men because we\u2019re going to be setting off soon.\u201d\n\nWell time to see if you\u2019re cut out for this line of work.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 28\n\nWhen you joined three years ago, you figured it would be a couple months maybe. You didn't know how far away all these places you're raiding were going to be, let alone how long it would be before you returned home.\n\nThe raids themselves aren\u2019t exactly fun for you either. You realize you\u2019re really not the bloodthirsty type who gets off on killing folks all the time. There\u2019s been a lot of times you\u2019ve hung back just so you can avoid most of the direct combat.\n\nAnd that\u2019s starting to getting a bit noticeable mainly because enough of the crew has died that it can\u2019t afford to have any slackers. Fortunately Captain Rifiv hasn\u2019t called you out on it and it\u2019s just been a few of the crew bitching at you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even counting the rape and there\u2019s a lot of that you haven\u2019t been engaging in either. Though some of them seem content on buggering each other. (And no matter how long you've been at sea, you can honestly say there's nothing that would even make you THINK about sticking it to any of this loathsome lot you're with!)\n\nThe only minor upside is you\u2019ve been doing okay as far as loot is concerned. These idiots haven\u2019t been paying attention that you\u2019ve been pilfering the odd coins or baubles from them so you actually have more than your share. However, you aren\u2019t exactly doing all that much better than you were as a regular thief though and worse, you\u2019re stuck at sea most of the time so you can\u2019t even enjoy it like you\u2019d prefer.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that you've learned your way around a ship a lot more, though you question if this knowledge would actually ever be useful since you\u2019re having serious doubts about ever setting foot on another ship ever again.\n\nCurrently you\u2019re somewhere in the far southwest seas at some small port town called Gix. The Steadfast has been using the place as a rest stop in between raids mainly because it\u2019s the only civilized place in this area that is accepting of pirates and has been for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nThis place isn\u2019t Hessla though and isn\u2019t a \u201ccriminal town.\u201d It\u2019s just run by normal people going about their simple normal lives. The locals are a bit live and let live for the most part. They don\u2019t particularly enjoy having violent drunken pirates visiting, but as long as the pirates aren\u2019t messing with them, they\u2019re fine with accommodating them.\n\nSort of reminds you of how Teckleville used to turn a blind eye to you and your sister robbing travelling merchants.\n\nYou miss those days and not even the robbing part. You find that you\u2019re missing home in general. Maybe not even home so much you miss the environment as strange as that might seem. Then again, you never had the wanderlust that your sister had. (You imagine other than the killing and rape, she\u2019d find all this pirate stuff pretty exciting) Had things been different you probably would have never left Teckleville.\n\nMaybe you would have eventually settled down and become boring like everyone else in that town. At this point that doesn\u2019t seem all that bad. You guess you\u2019re just realizing that you\u2019re starting to get tired of this life.\n\nSince you\u2019re hanging out with the Steadfast crew most of the time, you always take the opportunity to stay away from the lot of them when in town. Instead of drinking at the \u201cpirate bar\u201d of the town, you drink at the quieter one that the locals seem to prefer.\n\nThe first time you entered you got a lot of strange looks, but now nobody bats an eye. You\u2019re just minding your business after all. Still, occasionally the barmaid speaks to you and is fairly cordial. Seems to be in a more talkative mood today\u2026\n\n\u201cAnother successful voyage of raiding and pillaging?\u201d Ola asks.\n\u201cI suppose so. Got enough money to spend here.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cDrinking does seem to be one of the more civilized favorite past times of you lot. Good thing of course since we\u2019d have significantly less coin coming into the town. Sort of wondering though, how come you always come in here rather than going to the usual taverns?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I have to spend practically all my time around those assholes, so the moment I actually don\u2019t have to is a blessing.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the folks you sail with, why do it?\u201d\n\u201cGood question, and one I\u2019ve been asking myself more and more each day before finally coming to the inevitable conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\u201cThat this pirate life isn\u2019t for me. As soon as we get back to Hessla, I\u2019m not setting foot on a ship again. (Sigh) Another year at sea though before we return\u2026ugh\u2026I just dunno if I can take it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why not just leave now?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026hmmm\u2026I suppose I could\u2026I doubt if they\u2019d come looking for me. Do you have any transport ships that go to Hessla?\u201d\n\nOla frowns a bit.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have ANY big ships. In case you haven\u2019t realized, we\u2019re a small town not a bustling trading city we hear you lot talk about. If it weren\u2019t for pirates coming here, we probably would never have much contact with the rest of the world. I mean the best you could do is get yourself a rowboat and row to this Hessla place. How far is it?\u201d Ola asks.\n\u201cToo far. I doubt if I could even make it to Jicol in a rowboat. Oh well, guess I can tough out another year.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy not just stay here?\u201d\n\u201cHere? What would I do here?\u201d\n\u201cUm, well you know your way around a ship right? You could work as a fisherman.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, trying to get away from boats actually. Still, sitting in a rowboat and peacefully fishing sounds a lot more attractive right now than what I am doing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are some of your other skills\u2026um, I mean those that don\u2019t involve killing and raping people.\u201d\n\u201cFirst off, I\u2019ve never raped anyone\u2026\u201d you start to say before Ola interrupts.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t? Oh thank Kalhu!\u201d\n\nYou give Ola a bit of a strange look. Granted you two don\u2019t really know each other that well, but she seems way more talkative than she has in the past. If you didn\u2019t know any better you\u2019d say she was flirting with you in some strange way.\n\n\u201cOkay, first who is Kalhu?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe god of this island of course. All the times you\u2019ve been here, you\u2019ve never heard of him before?\u201d Ola says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t really pay much attention to religion. You\u2019re not going to preach at me are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, why would I?\u2019\n\u201cBecause you seem very interested in my future and we don\u2019t know each other very well, so I\u2019m wondering what this is all about.\u201d\n\nOla looks around and finally sits down next to you. A couple people look, but say nothing, you\u2019re a little taken back by all this though.\n\n\u201cThis town is a good place with good people. We like our relative isolation, especially after hearing some of the tales from your pirate shipmates and other pirates we\u2019ve dealt with in the past. But um\u2026isolation has its downsides. There sometimes is um\u2026lack of potential mates. At least not related ones.\u201d Ola says.\n\nYou start to tense up at where this might be going.\n\n\u201cNow some women of this town have sex with the pirates that visit here and that\u2019s good as it provides new blood for the town, but it is sometimes hard on these mothers to raise these children without a father around. A good family should have a mother and father.\u201d Ola says.\n\u201cSo\u2026what exactly are you asking me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking if you would consider\u2026(breathes nervously) being my husband.\u201d\n\nYou had a feeling, but you still weren\u2019t quite prepared. How could you be? It isn\u2019t like you get asked out of the blue to be someone\u2019s husband!\n\nOla goes on to explain that she knows how this might seem strange to an outsider like you, but she says that she fears her arranged marriage to her cousin since he has many undesirable physical traits that would not make for a strong child.\n\nHowever, she also doesn\u2019t wish to submit herself to a one-night stand with some pirate (Apparently she\u2019s a bit on the moral side which is funny that she would come to you in the first place) and wants a husband to stick around to help raise your children. (Yes, she\u2019s already implied that she wants more than one.)\n\nSo she\u2019s picked you as a \u201clast ditch\u201d effort to find a husband who is physically fit (and attractive as she has mentioned as a secondary concern) and is most assuredly not related to her in some way. She also has said in the few conversations you\u2019ve had with her you seem okay personality wise and not being a rapist is a big plus to her. (Curse your parents for instilling some sort of values in you)\n\nFor her part, Ola seems like a nice girl and isn\u2019t ugly. She\u2019s no Annah or Yvette, but you could certainly do worse.\n\nYou\u2019re a bit overwhelmed by all this sudden information though and as much as you don\u2019t want to get back on the Steadfast again, that\u2019s only going to be a year. This is going to be well\u2026presumably until you die because she\u2019s already made it quite clear that passage off this island is a rarity.\n\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t see home again.\n\nBut then again what did you really have going on there? You tried being a thief and that didn\u2019t work out like you planned. You tried this pirate thing and that hasn\u2019t worked out either. All you\u2019ve gotten is headache from your life of crime and not much to show for it ultimately. Also you don\u2019t really have a home anymore anyway seeing as you got permanently kicked out of Teckleville.\n\nThat thought about you finally giving all this up and becoming a normal boring person? Well that day might be today.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get married", "result": "It\u2019s crazy and maybe you\u2019re going to severely regret this later, but getting married and out of this life sounds a whole hell of a lot better than getting on that ship for another year.\n\n\u201cFuck it, let\u2019s do it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Ola asks a little surprised.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m serious. Where and when is this going to happen?\u201d\n\u201cUh, well when I get off work in a little while we could go to the temple of Kalhu. The shaman should be able to perform the ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t need your parents there or anything?\u201d\n\u201cNo, all we need to be is bonded in the many eyes of Kalhu. This is great! This is really wonderful!\u201d Ola beams.\n\nYou still have a few questions even though because while you\u2019re half way committing to this, there is still time to back out if it\u2019s too crazy.\n\n\u201cUm, okay, but wait I do need to ask. This isn\u2019t going to piss off your family is it? I mean you were engaged to your cousin, I don\u2019t want to cause some family drama or feud.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose my cousin will be upset, but you hardly have to worry about him. He\u2019s not really fit and strong like you are. His mother might also be upset, but as far as my family goes you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems. My father might be gruff with you, but his main concern is if you\u2019re going to be a good provider. Now did you do anything before being a pirate?\u201d\n\nYou explain to Ola some of your past, which causes another frown from her. However when you get past all the thief stuff and briefly mention dealing with some wildlife for Dr. Gossey she stops you.\n\n\u201cWait, so you have experience trapping and dealing with fauna?\u201d Ola asks.\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t say that exactly. I mean I had a pet qweepa, but that\u2019s because I had it from when it was a baby. And I had to collect these monster snail crab eggs.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat may be good enough. My cousin is a trapper and needs help sometimes keeping the pest population down in this town. He can teach you all you need to know. You could probably work with him.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t that be weird considering I\u2019m marrying you?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh no, this is a different cousin and he\u2019s married to my older sister so there won\u2019t be any trouble there.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well that\u2019s good to hear, I guess.\u201d\n\nOla goes on excitedly about how she will be a good wife to you and believes that Kalhu must have sent you personally to reward her for her prayers to him. This is all getting a little too \u201creal\u201d for you and you tell her that you need to get a few things from the ship, but this makes her nervous.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming back right?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back, don\u2019t worry. I just really need to get the rest of my belongings off the ship. I mean I have a tidy hidden sum still aboard the ship, if I\u2019m staying I don\u2019t want to just abandon that.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026okay I trust you. But please hurry back!\u201d Ola says and then kisses you on the lips.\n\nShe then walks away with a smile, but it\u2019s very apparent she\u2019s concerned you are leaving.\n\nAnd honestly you\u2019re wondering if you should.\n\nYou leave the tavern and quickly make your way back to the ship. You pace the floor of the empty cabin still wondering what the hell you\u2019re going to do. You feel really bad for just leaving Ola. She didn\u2019t really deserve getting her hopes up, only to get them destroyed. But\u2026\n\nGetting married? Being a pest trapper? Settling down and having a whole mess o babies? What the hell were you thinking?\n\n\u201cHey, didn\u2019t expect anyone to be aboard, well except the captain and he\u2019s always in his quarters.\u201d One of your fatter crewmates says as he comes wandering in the door.\n\n\u201cHey you seen my lucky dice? Gotta game with Fleegle and Hok an\u2019 those dice never let me down yet.\u201d He asks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d you say still lost in your own thoughts.\n\u201cMeh, no matter, those two idiots got the worst luck anyway. I\u2019ll easily take them like I took that long haired lass on the last ship we raided, hahahahaha!\u201d\n\nYou continue to pace and think, but this asshole keeps insisting on speaking to you.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s crawled up yer ass and got you all jittery? Yer about to wear a hole in the floor.\u201d He asks.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like nothin\u2019 to me. You worrying about all the mermaid rumors in these southern waters? Listen I\u2019ve been at sea long before you were even unleashed from yer father\u2019s balls and I ain\u2019t never seen a mermaid. They don\u2019t even fucking exist\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWill you just shut the fuck up?! I don\u2019t give a shit about what you have to fucking say! I got my own problems!\u201d you snap.\n\nThe fat pirate\u2019s demeanor now changes to hostility.\n\n\u201cYou fucking little cunt. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t kick the shit out of you and throw you overboard after I\u2019m done shoving my big fat cock up yer prissy ass. I see you walkin\u2019 around here thinkin\u2019 yer too good for this life and keepin\u2019 to yerself. And that\u2019s fine, but I also see that YOU haven\u2019t been pullin\u2019 yer fuckin\u2019 weight around here. Whenever we go on a raid, you stay in the back like a fucking bitch. Well let me tell you something, the next raid we go on, I better see some fucking bloodshed or I\u2019m gonna make good on my previous threat.\u201d\n\nThis fat ass is twice your size and you don\u2019t have much room to move around. You back down.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, apologies. Just a little preoccupied with something and I didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you.\u201d You say holding your hands up and stepping back. The fat pirate smirks and snorts in distain at your compliance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s at that moment you\u2019ve made your choice.\n\nAs soon as he turns his back, you punch the fat fuck as hard as you can in the base of his skull. The big man being unprepared for this crumples into the lowest hanging hammock and then you do it again. You aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019ve killed him, but he\u2019s not moving. No matter, they\u2019ll probably think he\u2019s just asleep for awhile.\n\n\u201cAll that time at sea and you never learned not to turn your back on a thief. Stupid fat asshole.\u201d You say.\n\nYou quickly gather up your belongings, loot the body of your dead crewmate and leave the ship. Fortunately you don\u2019t bump into any other crewmembers or the captain on your way out.\n\nYou return to the tavern where Ola works. She\u2019s busy at the moment, but smiles when she sees you. While you wait for her shift to be over, you go through your small bag of valuables (as well as your newly acquired one) and try to find something to give to her. With a bit more luck on your side, you manage to find a gold ring. Probably not her size, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\n\nLater that night, you and Ola go to the temple of Kalhu. The shaman there is a bit strange and so is the ceremony, but happily it\u2019s not that long. Within just a half hour, you\u2019re married and you soon find out that Ola\u2019s years of purity have paid off in your favor because apparently she had A LOT of pent up\u2026\u201denergy.\u201d You don\u2019t even make it that far out the temple before she\u2019s ready to consummate the marriage! Certainly no complaint on that front at least.\n\nOver the course of the next few days you mainly hideout at Ola\u2019s cousin\u2019s home (The pest trapper, not the one you just stole his bride to be from) since you\u2019re a little concerned that your fellow crewmates are going to come looking for you. However, they either don\u2019t give a shit that you killed fat ass, or they still think he\u2019s asleep. Either way, they ultimately leave without you and you\u2019re finally in the clear.\n\nYou aren\u2019t exactly religious yourself, but you do give a little silent praise to Yag for your incredible fortune over these last few days. You just hope if he IS watching over you even to the smallest degree that your luck doesn\u2019t suddenly turn to shit for your brand new life.\n\nAnd it is a brand new life now. You\u2019re married and on your way to be just some boring normal person in some boring small town that was much like the one you got run out of over a decade ago. Not to mention you\u2019ll most likely live out the rest of your life and die here.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. Things could be a lot worse. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even still find a little excitement here and there even if it is of the mundane kind. This is after all a whole different experience for you to discover and enjoy if you can.\n\nWhatever happens, your days as a rogue are over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Get back to the ship", "result": "It\u2019s just too much to sacrifice. Maybe you\u2019ll settle down one day, maybe even after you get back to Hessla, but you can\u2019t see yourself doing it here stuck in some island at the ass end of the world to a girl you hardly know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ola, but I just can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re a nice girl, but this is too sudden and we don\u2019t know each other well enough.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI understand. I was not hopeful of my odds anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWe could still, you know\u2026do the other thing if you want.\u201d\n\nOla shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I just wasn\u2019t raised that way. Things might be much easier if I hadn\u2019t. (Sigh) I will remain pure for my husband to be. My cousin deserves that much.\u201d Ola says and gets up to leave.\n\nSeeing as things are a bit awkward here now, you decide to leave altogether. You figure you\u2019ll just spend the remainder of your time on board the ship in the bunks. It\u2019ll be time to leave soon anyway.\n\nSure enough in a few days you\u2019re on your way.\n\nYear 29\n\nHalf of the year has already passed, but it can\u2019t end soon enough. You\u2019re barely getting along with most of the crew at this point and all this violence you\u2019ve been participating in has made you less tolerant in general.\n\nYou\u2019ve already had a couple of fistfights with a few. While this hasn\u2019t done much to improve your popularity nobody is ever accusing you of being a pussy who doesn\u2019t pull his weight. Figures you\u2019d start fitting in towards the end.\n\nOf course you have no intention of continuing being a pirate and are still fully dedicated to leaving this shitty experience behind. You still have no idea what you\u2019re going to do when you get back. Your experience with Ola months ago has made you rethink your ideas of possibly \u201csettling down.\u201d You\u2019re starting to think maybe you might try your hand at being a mercenary or something similar. You have gotten very good at killing and it doesn\u2019t even bother you anymore after all. (It\u2019s just being around all these assholes on this cramped ship that bothers you)\n\nAs you\u2019re looking off into the ocean pondering your potential new career when you get back, you start to hear something.\n\nYes\u2026kill.\n\nYou look around and immediately shout at one of your nearest shipmates.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t say nuthin.\u201d He says and backs away a bit.\n\nYou return to your thoughts and then hear something else.\n\nKill them all\u2026\n\nThe voice is very close, like it\u2019s almost coming inside your head. You rub your eyes and then you notice a medium splash in the waters. When you look harder you see a head briefly pop up. Looks female.\n\nYou need to kill them all and return them to the sea\u2026to be with us\u2026forever\n\nNow your mind feels like a thousand needles are being shoved in it as these voices assault it. You crumple to the deck and you\u2019re so busy clutching your head in pain and trying to fight whatever is attacking you, that you don\u2019t even notice that other crew members are starting to suffer similar affects.\n\nSome of the crew immediately jump overboard, others are wailing in pain and barely moving. Captain Rifiv at this point has come out of his cabin and begun yelling at everyone to shove wax in their ears.\n\nIt\u2019s a little too late for you however. The mermaids already have taken advantage of your less than stable mood and are now directing you to do something you\u2019ve thought about doing many times anyway. Namely killing the assholes you\u2019re sailing with.\n\nYou waste no time in obeying the siren\u2019s call of murdering your shipmates, most of which don\u2019t put up too much of a fight due to their own mind assaults.\n\nYou do fairly well cutting down most of the crew, but even with mermaid help, you still are only one man and eventually Captain Rifiv puts you down with shot to your back which is then followed up by several cutlass chops to the neck and head by some of the less helpless crew.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Rat on the Talons", "result": "Well, ratting on the Crimson Talons probably isn\u2019t the worst thing you\u2019ve done\u2026\n\nYou go back to the militia barracks where you\u2019re immediately stopped by some of its members who ask what you want. When you tell them that you want to speak to the officer in charge because you have information on the Crimson Talons, they tell you to wait while someone goes and gets Captain Branik, who apparently was the one interrogating you earlier.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before you see this captain, who gives you a mildly smug look.\n\n\u201cWell, look who\u2019s back. Thought you didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d Branik says.\n\u201cI just remembered some details that slipped my mind.\u201d You retort.\n\u201cHmm, well out with it then, and if your information is any good then we will have come to an understanding.\u201d\n\nYou give out what you know of the Crimson Talons, but specifically their headquarters location. He says something about how he can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve been there the whole time. You also mention the secret sewer tunnel that leads from outside the city. Branik seems especially pleased by this information and mentions he\u2019ll send people through there as well when they move in to attack the place.\n\n\u201cThis of course is all going to take a little time to put together and confirm, so in the meantime I\u2019d like you to stay in the city. You know, just in case you\u2019re lying and this isn\u2019t some sort of set up.\u201d Branik says.\n\u201cWhat? What would I possibly gain by setting you up for anything? YOU told me to help you!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, but you didn\u2019t do it right away and even managed to disappear from the militia\u2019s watchful eye for awhile. I can\u2019t know if you haven\u2019t already tipped off your Crimson Talon buddies or something more sinister. So to put those concerns to rest, I just need you to stay within the city so that I may easily get a hold of you until this is all over. Be thankful I\u2019m not just throwing you in a cell.\u201d\n\nNo good deed\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the best deal you\u2019re going to get at this point and really you have no idea now if the captain is even going to hold on to his end. Meanwhile you\u2019re probably still going to be having these militia assholes following you all over the city, which you can\u2019t even leave now!\n\nYou just leave shaking your head at the entire situation.\n\nYou honestly don\u2019t know what to do with yourself. You suppose you could live on your savings until all this shit blows over, but again you have no idea when that will be and if that asshole captain is even going to give you a break.\n\nYou still have to find a new place to live and you suppose squatting in your family\u2019s old inn is out now seeing as it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\nLacking any better ideas, you decide to go to the Church of Joachim that Virgil suggested. At least it will be free.\n\nThere are actually more than a few in the city, but you figure Virgil was talking about the one closest to the Welcome Mat so that\u2019s the one you seek out. It\u2019s probably the biggest one anyway due to more poor folks in the area sponging off the charity that the church provides.\n\nWhen you get there you find that it\u2019s feeding the beggars day. Great now you have to put up with that smell along with whatever religious shit that\u2019s going to be preached at you.\n\nYou see Virgil serving up bowls of swill and approach him since you figure he knows where the flop room for the poor is.\n\n\u201cHey Virgil.\u201d You say while trying not to get in the way of the hungry beggars who are eagerly taking their food and leaving.\n\u201cHello. Surprised, but glad to see you. I\u2019m a little busy at the moment, but what can I do for you?\u201d Virgil responds.\n\u201cYou said I could stay here awhile? Having sort of a problem finding a place to live at the moment.\u201d\n\u201cOh sure. We have space so you can stay as long as you like, but erm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut erm, what?\u201d\n\u201cWell I know you\u2019re not exactly poor beggar or destitute mother with children and Brother Thadius is sort of a stickler for the rules.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe if you could donate to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!\u201d you exclaim at which point Virgil tells you to keep your voice down.\n\n\u201cVirgil, you TOLD me that you wanted to make amends to me or whatever and you also TOLD me that I could stay here for free!\u201d you say.\n\u201cActually I never said it was free\u2026(Sigh) but I suppose it is true, I might have given you a false impression. For that I am sorry. However, you could still stay here for free, but it would still require something of you.\u201d Virgil says.\n\nYou at first think Virgil is going to tell you to get him a bottle of alcohol or maybe ask you to steal something. You\u2019re just counting on religious hypocrisy to rear its head, so it\u2019s a bit surprising when he asks you:\n\n\u201cIf you could help me serve these bowls of soup, that I think would be enough to allow you to stay here for free.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026are you\u2026(Sigh) fuck it. Fine.\u201d\n\nYou spend the next few hours serving swill to dirty, smelly beggars, bums, and the destitute. You can\u2019t believe it\u2019s come to this.\n\nAbout the only think that breaks up the monotony is you have to throw out a Yellow Devil junkie who gets a little aggressive with the others. Normally you don\u2019t get excessively hostile to the point of violence unless its necessary, but you\u2019re in a foul mood due to current events. Just as you\u2019re about to really kick his ass until Virgil stops you.\n\n\u201cHey, hey, easy! He\u2019s had enough; look he\u2019s going now. And I think you\u2019ve had enough too. Thanks for your help; you can find a space on the floor in the sleeping area in the back of the church.\u201d Virgil says.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything and just head to where Virgil said to go. When you enter the room, it isn\u2019t quite as bad as you thought it would be. Apparently most of the beggar types actually prefer sleeping in their own personal areas on the streets rather than a relatively clean church. Go figure.\n\nWhat you do see more of is \u201cregular poor folk.\u201d Families who have obviously suffered some hardship causing them to be homeless for whatever reason. You imagine their faith in Joachim keeps them going that things will get better. The fools.\n\nYou find a corner to be in, make a pillow with your bag and try to get some rest despite the sounds of children and people nearby. You can regroup tomorrow, you always do.\n\nNext day\u2026\n\nYou head to the university seeing as you don\u2019t have anything better planned at the moment.\n\nOf course as soon as you start heading that way, militia is on your ass already. This is ridiculous. It\u2019s like they suddenly have some sixth sense of your whereabouts. You try to lose them a couple times and while you do succeed, it once again has taken you out of your way to your destination. Eventually you manage to get a carriage and ride to the university. From there you get to work.\n\nAll is going relatively well, though you do catch sight of more than a few wandering militia. You aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re there specifically for you or just the usual.\n\nOn your way through one of the many student-gathering areas, you suddenly hear someone call out your name. You turn around and get a surprise.\n\n\u201cYvette?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cGlad to see you remembered me. How have you been?\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m okay. And yourself? You probably graduated and are some sort of powerful wizard by now.\u201d\n\u201cOn the graduation part yes, on the powerful wizard bit, well that\u2019s debatable. I\u2019m sort of teaching and doing independent research on possible new spell components. It\u2019s a really good thing that the wizard college has such a generous benefactor on the Klyton Council. Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d be doing with my life.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wizard, surely there\u2019s no limit to what you could do.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose in some ways, but I guess I just like what I get to do now\u2026is something wrong? You seem a bit distracted.\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just surprised to see you, let alone you even talking to me. Last time I remember you were pretty pissed at me.\u201d\n\u201cOh. That. Yeah, I always meant to apologize to you about that, but I couldn\u2019t find you. I asked Dr. Gossey, but she said she didn\u2019t know much about you outside the times you helped her. I only knew your first name, but I didn\u2019t know what your area of study was. I must have went through a lot student lists, but never could track you down. I even tried some divination magic, but nothing turned up. Though I never was very good at that. Still, it almost seemed like you never even went here.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, yeah\u2026wow didn\u2019t realize you looked for me. I\u2019m really flattered.\u201d\n\u201cWell I gave up after about a year. I figured you probably graduated by then\u2026so what are you doing here then? Are you teaching now too? What was your study anyway?\u201d\n\nYvette is flooding you with questions that you weren\u2019t really prepared to answer with well thought out lies. She\u2019s being pretty friendly though and given how things have been going, it\u2019s nice a change. You sort of wonder about the fact that she looked for you for a year. Obviously, she had more in mind than just to apologize.\n\nIf you\u2019d known that, you would have made more of an effort to seek her out too, rather than just fucking a whore that looked only vaguely like her a few times.\n\nWell, hopefully better late than never\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just going to come out and ask. Were you interested in me back then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026\u201d Yvette stutters.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d\n\u201cWell wait no. I mean yeah, but\u2026oh I\u2019m not very good at this.\u201d\n\u201cCalm yourself then just speak your mind.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well, I didn\u2019t NOT like you. I mean I liked all of our time together up until Kelium died. Between that and worrying about my report, your kiss sort of caught me off guard. After my report was a success, I had time to think about your advance and while I would have preferred something less aggressive, I can\u2019t say that I entirely disliked it. Actually it might have even helped my report.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cYes, at the time I was so pissed at you that I ended up telling my superiors the story we agreed upon as well as adding that it was all your fault that things didn\u2019t go as planned. Since I was so mad at you, it came off as believable hence a successful report. I was actually going to thank you for that too.\u201d\n\nYou laugh a bit.\n\n\u201cWell glad it helped I guess. Though I suppose my question is and again this might be a long shot, but are you still interested in me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. I mean it was years ago. We still don\u2019t know much about each other. I suppose the answer is the same as it was back then, I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to seeing you. I\u2019m currently unattached. I have a bit of trouble meeting people that aren\u2019t also magic users and the few I do seem to get scared that I have magic powers.\u201d Yvette answers.\n\u201cWhat about other wizards?\u201d\n\u201cHah, yeah\u2026well after going out with a few magic users in the past, that has not gone very well. I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re doing okay so far, but here\u2019s where the problem is going to come in, your real life.\n\nIf you pursue this relationship, you are going to have to change your life severely because you are entirely sure that Yvette is definitely not going to be good with your roguish ways.\n\nOddly, this isn\u2019t completely unappealing to you. Granted you\u2019ve had an okay day here at the university, but how long before the militia gets more savvy and starts watching your movements here a lot more? You still can\u2019t walk to most places without them around and again you still don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to hold up their end and leave you alone after they bust up the Crimson Talons.\n\nWhen you really think back to what you\u2019ve managed to accomplish as a rogue you aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s worth it anymore. All you\u2019ve been doing is going through the motions because you don\u2019t know any other way.\n\nBut if you really put your mind to it, you\u2019re a resourceful guy; you probably COULD do something different if you wanted to.\n\nIn any case, you still need to know how you\u2019re going to deal with Yvette. You could just tell her the truth about your life, which would prevent a possible shitstorm later, of course it could fuck up things now. Especially since you\u2019ve basically been lying to her up until this point.\n\nOf course if you\u2019ve been lying to her all this time, you could just continue doing it and hope for the best. You could still try to change your life, but just not reveal your past.", "action_results": [{"action": "Lie to Yvette", "result": "This relationship, if there is even going to be one is on shaky ground already. You can\u2019t imagine the truth really helping you out here.\n\n\u201cYvette, I think before we go any further I should reveal something first because it\u2019s only fair that you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cUh oh.\u201d Yvette responds.\n\nYou explain that not long after your job with Dr. Gossey, you had to drop out of college because your parents suffered hardship back home and you had to help them out. After burying them both, you tell her there was nothing for you left in that one horse town, so with what money you had from selling the property you returned here. You tell her that you\u2019ve actually only just recently returned hoping you could maybe find work here at the university and re-attend classes in the meantime on a work-study type program, but you haven\u2019t had much luck.\n\nYou go on to say, you\u2019re sort of giving up on the whole college thing and just trying to find ANY job since your savings are running low.\n\nIt\u2019s a bullshit tearjerker story that you threw together at the last minute.\n\nNaturally Yvette still being the trusting soul you figured she would be, she swallows every line of it.\n\n\u201cOh I had no idea! And I had treated you so terrible before all that happened!\u201d Yvette exclaims.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not like you could have known. Shit happens.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but still. I guess that\u2019s explains why I couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m here now, if you\u2019re still interested of course. I mean I\u2019d completely understand if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cGee, I mean it would look pretty shallow of me if I said I wasn\u2019t\u2026not that I\u2019m saying that. It\u2019s just it seems like you have a lot of other things you need to take care of before entertaining the idea of us going out together.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, trust me, you\u2019ve been the single light during this dismal period, so you can bet I\u2019m going to make the effort to spend time with you. I think I might have a lead on a job actually though, so if you could, maybe wait for me a little while longer? We could just meet up here and spend time until I get my shit together. Would that be acceptable?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that would be nice. Yes, okay. You can usually find me in the magic college dorms or the college itself. Probably best if you go to the college since the dorms have some security that could be problematic if you aren\u2019t a wizard type or with one.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, great. Gotta go now, but before I do, may I have your permission this time?\u201d\n\u201cPermission for what?\u201d\n\u201cTo kiss you of course.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, well okay, but just on the cheek this time!\u201d\n\nYou move in and give Yvette a quick peck on the cheek causing her to smile a bit which you return before you take your leave.\n\nYou make your way back to the church as quick as you can, you don\u2019t even bother worrying about the squad of militia following you around. It\u2019s time to call in that big favor Virgil says he owes you, you just hope he can deliver without some stupid stipulation this time.\n\nYou find Virgil speaking with a couple of the poor folk about the light of Joachim or whatever.\n\n\u201cVirgil! I need your help let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? But I\u2019m in the middle of spreading the word of Joachim.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well you got all the fucking time in the world to do that. These folks aren\u2019t going to get any less desperate within the hour so just talk to me now and be done with it.\u201d\n\nVirgil sensing that you\u2019re going to be as obnoxious as you can be until he speaks with you excuses himself and goes to see you.\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re taking advantage of my kindness.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cYeah, just like you took advantage of mine when you were begging me for coin during your drunk days. Look, I\u2019m just going to ask for a simple favor, one that will actually get you out of your hair in the long run. Can you get me a job?\u201d you say.\n\u201cA job? What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cA job man! A job! Like you go there, you do some shit and then you go back home and eventually they pay you for all the shit you did. You repeat until dead or fired.\u201d\n\u201cYOU want a REAL job? Are you sober?\u201d\n\u201cCompletely.\u201d\n\u201cWow. You continue to surprise me. Maybe Joachim\u2019s light really has\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh no! Don\u2019t start with the religious shit. I just know you have people coming in and out of this church all the time and not ALL of them are the charity cases. Some of them are just here to pray or attend services or whatever it is you lot do.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but what are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cWell I know you religious types have tend to have tight knit communities. Surely you know someone who might be able to give me a job.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, maybe. But is there anything in particular you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\u201cObviously something befitting of my talents!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, but I think thievery is off the table.\u201d\n\u201cHey I used to sell stolen items too.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, wait a minute. You uh, used to pick locks right?\u201d\n\u201cSure did and if I may say so myself, I was pretty damn good at it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I do know someone. He\u2019s an older man by the name of Ned and is a locksmith by trade. I think he\u2019s looking for an assistant.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. Guess that would be a good fit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026too good in fact. You aren\u2019t going to use this as some way of breaking the law are you?\u201d\n\u201cIf I was, do you think I\u2019d tell you? You\u2019re funny. But if it puts your mind at ease, then no I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t leave the city, the militia watches me all the fucking time, and I\u2019m living in a damn church. Obviously my life style has NOT been successful. Time to change it up, especially since I might have a second chance with this girl I like. Yes, I said it. I\u2019m doing this for a girl.\u201d\n\nVirgil smirks a bit.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the grin?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cJoachim works in mysterious ways. Maybe you don\u2019t see it or choose not to, but his influence is there. Little steps to righteousness and perhaps in more time you\u2026\u201d Virgil says before you interrupt.\n\u201cWill you get out of here and just go get me that job! And don\u2019t tell him the truth just say I\u2019m an engineer down on my luck or something.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to lie?!\u201d\n\u201cI want you to fulfill your damn promise without a bunch of bullshit tacked on to it! Now you do what you gotta do, you can always ask Joachim for forgiveness afterwards.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Very well. I just hope you\u2019re being truthful in all this.\u201d\n\nWith the plan set in motion things turn around fairly quickly. In a few days you get the job as an assistant to the locksmith. Turns out he\u2019s a good old guy. Tends to talk a lot about his dead wife and his runaway daughter who he hasn\u2019t seen in decades, but you suppose you understand he has a great sense of loss and wants to vent to someone. You\u2019re just glad he doesn\u2019t ask too much about your life or get too religious on you.\n\nThe pay is\u2026adequate. It\u2019s at least enough to get yourself a new cheap place and keep you in the basics. In the meantime the militia is still following you around. They\u2019re probably wondering what the hell you\u2019re up to.\n\nIn the next month, you go see Yvette who is expecting you since you wrote a letter ahead of time. You meet and catch up on what the pair of you have been doing over the past few years, or rather in your case LYING about what you\u2019ve been up to. You still try to keep the lying to a minimum but keeping the topics either light or focusing on her activity instead which is easy since she really likes talking about her spell stuff. (Which to be honest you don\u2019t completely grasp all of it)\n\nWithin the next few months big news in Klyton hits when its announced that the Crimson Talons have been officially taken down. Captain Branik gets an award from the council and exclaims how brave his people were as they stormed the Talon hideout. Apparently they didn\u2019t take any of them alive though you get the impression that if any did surrender the militia wouldn\u2019t have been the type to just accept it anyway.\n\nYou don\u2019t get any official word from anyone saying that you\u2019re off the hook let alone any thanks that you were the one that gave the information of their hideout. You do notice that the militia doesn\u2019t follow you around like it once did, so you take that as a sign that you must be off probation so to speak.\n\nStill, though you\u2019ve managed to \u201cbe good\u201d for a few months now and things are going good with Yvette and your new job isn\u2019t even all that bad even if it\u2019s a little boring at times.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t any need for you to go back to your old ways. Maybe it\u2019s time to give this new life a longer try.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 27\n\n\u201cIs it too expensive?\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cWell we could afford it, but I shudder to think what the ongoing property tax is going to be like.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI suppose\u2026but it\u2019s so nice!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s also a security hazard. I mean the locks on these doors are just pathetic. There are windows everywhere, which would allow for any thief to break into. There isn\u2019t even any fencing around this place. We\u2019d have to spend more money just to secure this place better.\u201d\n\u201cYou are really paranoid sometimes. You always think someone is going to break in someplace. This is a good neighborhood and ever since the Talons were eliminated the crime rate has gone down anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no reason to be off guard. I\u2019m just saying that as a locksmith I have some experience in these matters.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re a thief!\u201d Yvette laughs and teasingly pokes you.\n\u201cYeah you got me.\u201d You joke back, finding her comment humorous in a completely different way than she does.\n\nYou then embrace Yvette and kiss her during the bit of playfulness. She then places your hand on her stomach. It\u2019s not visibly noticeable yet, but your son or daughter is in there.\n\nYou never thought you\u2019d be in this position, on the verge of marriage with a baby on the way. So much has changed that it\u2019s hard to believe, but everything is good or at least everything save for one thing.\n\nYou still have yet to meet Yvette\u2019s father. (Yvette\u2019s mother unfortunately died while giving birth to her) You\u2019ve managed to avoid it for a long time. Part of that was because it wasn\u2019t like Yvette was in a hurry for you to meet him either. She\u2019d mention him in passing at times, but she always gave the impression that he was a rather distant and cold man who only paid for Yvette\u2019s college out of the barest sense of parental duty.\n\nStill, the man is her father and the fact you got her pregnant BEFORE you married her is something you\u2019re going to have to deal with because Yvette just couldn\u2019t bear to keep a grandchild from him a secret.\n\nYou know that while he isn\u2019t on the council, he does something important in the government, which is something you generally try to avoid. However, it\u2019s better to get this over with.\n\n\u201cI think I should go meet your father.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Now?\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. It\u2019s just; it was a nice day before you brought that up. Are you okay going alone? I just met with daddy again a few days ago and he was as unpleasant with me as ever.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he yell and threaten you? I mean you\u2019re a powerful wizard, I would think that would be a deterrent.\u201d\n\u201cYou always keep saying that and I\u2019m not. But anyway, as I said he never does any of that and short of him hitting me which he would never do, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to cast a lightning bolt at my father for being a jerk. He just was very disapproving. I mean I suppose I get it\u2026but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYvette, look don\u2019t beat yourself over it. I want you to stay in positive spirits okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. But anyway, he should be home right now. Takes most of his work home with him. I don\u2019t think he gets along with a lot of people there either.\u201d\n\nParting ways with your beloved, you head to Yvette\u2019s father\u2019s home which actually isn\u2019t too far away from where you were looking at potential houses.\n\nWhen you arrive it isn\u2019t a mansion, but certainly nice place befitting of someone who works high up in the government.\n\nYou knock on the door and half expect a servant of some sort to answer, but instead an older man with dark circles under his eyes, thinning white hair and what is probably a permanent scowl answers the door. His eyes look you up and down and he even makes a little snort sound as if he\u2019s clearly unimpressed by you.\n\n\u201cUh Mr. Franklins?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re the lowly sneak thief rat who somehow managed to fool my trusting daughter into going out with you. And not only that, but you got her pregnant with your criminal seed before you even had the decency to marry her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you can even answer this, the old man manages to catch you with a left to your jaw. You fall on your ass and hold the side of your face. The old man packs quite the punch.\n\n\u201cOkay. I probably deserved that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cPfft. YOU deserve much more than that, however what\u2019s done is done. When you\u2019re done befouling my porch with your presence, you can come inside and befoul that too.\u201d Mr. Franklins remarks.\n\nYou pick yourself up off the floor and follow Yvette\u2019s father into his house. He sits down in a comfortable chair and just as you\u2019re about to do likewise, he tells you to stop.\n\n\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to fucking sit down. You stand there and listen to what I have to say, because I\u2019m not going to repeat myself. Now, before I begin, don\u2019t bother trying to lie to me. As I said, I know who the hell you are. Who you REALLY are. Just because my daughter only recently told me about you, doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t keeping an eye on you before. I did my research. I\u2019m a little foggy for a few things on your past, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I know that you are\u2026or I suppose WERE a thief of little importance in this city, which you aren\u2019t even a citizen of. It seems the only reason why you stopped is due to pressure from the militia and meeting my daughter again. The first reason I\u2019d dismiss as simple cowardice since you ratted on the Crimson Talons in order to catch a break in the first place. However, the second reason, well that one takes a little more examination.\u201d\n\u201cIf you knew all this why not warn your daughter ahead of time?\u201d\n\u201cPfft. Like she\u2019d listen to me. Besides, by the time I did find out about all this, you and her were together for at least a year, and I knew she was in love. It was in her eyes. Never seen her so happy when she was with you. I know it now more than ever just from how she spoke of you to me. Attempting to break you up at that point would have crushed her and now would be unthinkable. And all of that\u2019s on me for not paying attention sooner and having you removed from her life.\u201d\n\u201cI guess thanks for not having me killed?\u201d\n\u201cWho said anything about killing you? I said removed. I could have just had the militia kick you out of the city and had you exiled. I\u2019m not a fucking murderer.\u201d\n\nYvette\u2019s father grabs a bottle of wine near his table and pours himself a glass, taking a drink before he continues to lecture you.\n\n\u201cNow here it is. Contrary to popular belief, I love my daughter. It may not seem like I do, but it\u2019s true. I just want her to be happy and apparently you make her happy. My point is, I believe you love her too because despite your lies about your past, you haven\u2019t gone back to any criminal activity and I\u2019m guessing now that you\u2019re trying to put down roots you probably won\u2019t be going back to your old life because YOU know that you struck gold when you met my daughter and you\u2019ll do ANYTHING not to fuck that up.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\n\u201cHm, which is about one of the few redeeming qualities about you that I can tell so far. (Sigh) Look, I\u2019m not a complete hard ass, but even with your good intentions I still can\u2019t shake the feeling you\u2019re going to fail my daughter spectacularly in some way in the future. Human nature is flexible only to a point and at some point you are probably going to snap. Maybe you won\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m going to give you an out right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Franklins suddenly gets up and goes to a drawer, grabs a bag and tosses it to you. You open it up and find diamonds. Flawless diamonds. There has to be hundreds of them here. This is a fortune that you couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine. There is also an odd shaped key and a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cThat is more riches than you need for your lifetime assuming you\u2019re not being a complete idiot with it. That key and deed are to a place in Jicol which is on an island not far from Hessla. You can probably take a ship to there. Granted I haven\u2019t been to the place in years, so I don\u2019t know what condition it\u2019s in, but with those diamonds I\u2019d wager you could fix the place up. Take them both and never return to Klyton.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYvette? She\u2019ll cry over you for a long time, but she\u2019ll carry on if only for the sake of your child. She\u2019ll probably blame me and I\u2019ll give her reason to. Better that I disappoint her than you. And your child? It will be taken care of, that you can be sure of. Even if my daughter refuses my help to support it, I can pull strings to still help her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d\n\u201cThen I suppose I\u2019ll have to hope that you prove me wrong.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the loot", "result": "You love Yvette, but ultimately you guess you love yourself just a little bit more.\n\nYou think about the sort of life you would have if you did marry Yvette. You\u2019d be an average working class slob with a family. While maybe there is some appeal to that over your old life, this offer is really making you rethink that maybe you were just settling for what seemed easier at the time when things were low.\n\nIf you married Yvette you\u2019d also have to keep up your lies to her about your past along with worrying about whether or not you\u2019re going to piss off her father enough for him to expose you. Can you really live a satisfying life with something like that hanging over your head?\n\nWhen it comes down to it you suppose you\u2019ve always wanted the easy life and this about as easy as it\u2019s ever going to get for you.\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll take your offer.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI knew you would.\u201d Franklins says a bit smugly and hands you the key.\n\nYou look at your newly acquired pay off, before putting it away. You\u2019re already having mixed feelings about your decision.\n\nYou have mixed feelings about your decision all the way to Hessla where upon your main concern is finding safe passage to Jicol since you don\u2019t want to linger very long here with the fortune you have on your person.\n\nOf course you think about going right back to Klyton several times, but by the time you do get a boat ride to Jicol you realize you\u2019re at the point of no return.\n\n\u201cJust do it.\u201d You say to yourself as you board the ship.\n\nThe ride to Jicol is uneventful even though you half expect to get attacked by pirates or something similar along the way. A small part of you even hopes you do because you sort of think you\u2019d deserve it.\n\nEventually you disembark at Jicol and based on the directions that Yvette\u2019s father provided you take your next steps in finding your new home along with familiarizing yourself with the city, which seems a lot less \u201corderly\u201d than Klyton though definitely more so than Hessla. Despite your rather dour mood, you still keep on your guard.\n\nYou soon find the place you were looking for and it\u2019s very average looking. Certainly better and bigger than any place you\u2019ve ever lived (including your parents old home) but it\u2019s no mansion. Just as well, you probably wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a place that size.\n\nYou try your key in the door and enter.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure how long Yvette\u2019s father has let this place go unused, but the first thing you notice is the severe dust everywhere. After checking everything it isn\u2019t too bad, except for maybe some fixes on the roof and the qweepa nest you notice in the basement.

What DO you do? You don\u2019t need to work and you don\u2019t even particularly want to go back to pursuing your criminal career again either. You\u2019ve been out of practice for a couple years now and why potentially mess up what you have?\n\nYou can\u2019t just sit around moping and beating yourself up about your decision either. The whole point of making this decision was so you didn\u2019t HAVE to worry about Yvette and your unborn child anymore.\n\nYou decide the best way to do this is with whores.\n\nAfter about a month you\u2019re slowly becoming more accustomed to living like a wealthy degenerate. You do nothing but eat, drink and fuck whores whenever you can, which is pretty much all the time.\n\nSometimes you still think about Yvette, but eventually those thoughts of her disappear altogether not wishing to dwell on how you most likely broke her heart and what \u201ccould have been\u201d if you stayed. You justify your actions that it was better this way for her and you.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re thirty you\u2019ve gotten fat. Not just average fat either, but like grossly fat. You\u2019re a big fat bastard.\n\nYou\u2019re also a pimp. Given how much time you spend with whores and how relatively fun you are, you eventually managed to convince a few to work for you, rather than one of the many brothels in the city. After all, your home is a lot nicer thanks to all the work you had done to it and you\u2019re well off enough to allow them to keep more of their money.\n\nThis works out for you since it provides a steady income (Negating your fears of going completely broke because you were spending so much) and finally gave you something to do with your free time. You still sometimes think of your parents and your sister and how they might be doing. You hope they\u2019re all doing well.\n\nDespite being limited to just one sex position that won\u2019t result in a whore\u2019s death it\u2019s all in all a good life.\n\nProbably won\u2019t be a very long one given your weight and indulgences, but then you probably beat the odds already.\n\nYour days as a rogue are over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Give back the loot", "result": "You have to admit, there is a small part of you that finds this tempting. A part of you that you thought you had abandoned, but as this bribe attempt has proven, your old nature is still there.

You\u2019re refusing and perhaps that\u2019s proof that you aren\u2019t the same person anymore.\n\n\u201cYeah, not taking this. If you want me gone then you\u2019re going to have to do it yourself. I\u2019m not going to make it easy for you and disappear voluntarily, just so it can ease your own conscience that if I took your bribe then you somehow did the right thing because I was a scumbag thief anyway.\u201d You say and toss the bag on the chair.\n\nMr. Franklin nods.\n\n\u201cVery well. You\u2019ve made your decision and I\u2019ll have to live with it. Inform Yvette That I begrudgingly accept that you are the father of my grandchild and acknowledge that you\u2019re at least competent enough to be a husband to her. Also that whether she wants me to attend the blessed event or not, I will pay for the entire wedding and whatever else she requires, but I want it to be at a church of Joachim, not one of those Dorna temples or whatever that goddess those wizards pay homage too.\u201d He says.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were a follower of Joachim.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cOf course I am! All right thinking folks are! I can only hope that some day my misguided daughter finds the light. Just because she was gifted with magic doesn\u2019t mean she has to kneel before a false goddess.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she does actually. I mean I know sometimes she says a few prayers, but I\u2019ve never known her to go to a temple or anything.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. I suppose that\u2019s slightly better. And I don\u2019t expect you\u2019re a follower of Joachim\u2019s light either. Probably a completely godless heathen.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve been to the church of Joachim a few times. Even been a long time friend with a priest of Joachim.\u201d You say embellishing the truth as usual, Mr. Franklins probably doesn\u2019t even believe it, but he hardly cares at this point.\n\n\u201cNow obviously I\u2019ll keep your secrets, but I hope for your sake you can maintain your own lies because if you DO hurt her, physically, mentally, emotionally, or whatever I will make it my personal mission to make your life a living hell. And again, I don\u2019t even mean death though you\u2019ll be begging for it by the time I\u2019m done.\u201d Franklins says.\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cAnd you are not off the hook with me. Which means if I need your help with some matter, I\u2019m going to call upon you and I will expect you to comply without complaint!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that you want me to do exactly?\u201d\n\u201cNothing right now. In fact I\u2019m not even sure how someone like you could even help me given my considerable resources. So maybe I\u2019ll never call on you for help. However, the real shits and giggles is YOU won\u2019t know until that day I do. Have fun living with that possibility.\u201d Franklins says with an amused tone. It\u2019s probably the first time he\u2019s sounded upbeat.\n\nFranklins then dismisses you and tells you to get the hell out of his house.\n\nWell that certainly wasn\u2019t exactly the meeting you were expecting. You suppose it went better than you expected, but worse than you hoped. You just know that old bastard is going to call on you for a favor one day.\n\nStill, you need to focus on the here and now and not what might never come and despite everything, you have Yvette\u2019s dad\u2019s support, if not his respect. You have a wedding to prepare for and all that other family stuff coming up.\n\nWith this final \u201cnail\u201d in the coffin so to speak, it would seem that your life has taken a completely different turn. You can\u2019t imagine ever going back to your old life again.\n\nYour mother and father would probably be proud if they knew about any of this. (You assume that they aren\u2019t really dead.)

Come in.\u201d Franklins says turning his back to you to as soon as he opens the door.\n\nHe takes a seat and for a change he tells you to do likewise.\n\n\u201cOkay, since I don\u2019t want you here any longer than necessary, let\u2019s get to it. I need you to break into some place.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t expect this.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou got fucking wax in your ears?

However, I know damn well you aren\u2019t out of practice because you\u2019re a fucking locksmith by trade.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but\u2026I\u2019m not understanding this. I thought you didn\u2019t approve of my previous occupation.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t, but desperate times call for desperate measures and besides all that, YOU owe me a favor and this is probably the only way I\u2019m going to be able to call it in. Besides, you\u2019ll be going up against pure evil, so what you\u2019re doing is for the greater good\u2026well I hope Joachim sees it that way at least.\u201d\n\u201cWait, pure evil? What the fuck? Look, I don\u2019t want to step out of line here, but I need to ask some questions.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to step out of line, but you\u2019re already stepping out of fucking line by asking damn questions!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I think it\u2019s fucking valid if you\u2019re sending me up against pure evil! I mean as you\u2019ve pointed out several times in the past, I\u2019m not a damn hero. I was a lowly criminal who is now a working class slob. I never was a fighting type to begin with and tried to avoid it if possible. Nevermind the fact that I\u2019m married to YOUR daughter and father to YOUR grand daughter and I\u2019ve made sure to never hurt either one of them. Seems like this is asking me to potentially do just that at best and just getting myself killed at worst.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine, I suppose you should know in case you need some extra preparation.\u201d\n\nFranklins pours himself a glass of wine and takes a drink before continuing.\n\n\u201cOkay, do you know who Mr. Reynolds is? Surely you must have heard of the man given that you were a thief at one time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a loan shark. My family actually was in debt to him once when they owned an inn here. Never met the man personally though since I tried to avoid being in debt.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, interesting. Well in any case, the man is more than just a loan shark. He\u2019s an embodiment of evil in this city and needs to be stopped from getting on the Klyton Council which he\u2019s been making plans to do.\u201d\n\u201cOkay? So if he\u2019s all that bad, why don\u2019t you have him arrested or something? You\u2019re always telling me you have connections.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well those connections aren\u2019t good enough to get him and he\u2019s got connections of his own. Doesn\u2019t help that anyone that might speak out against him aren\u2019t just intimidated by him, but are also intimidated by those two goons he hangs around with. One of them being his equally demonic son and weird looking ogre.\u201d\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t like this guy do you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, because despite him being an obvious evil piece of demon shit, he has been gaining a following that genuinely likes him now. In fact the asshole is probably more popular than I am among people who actually pay attention to politics.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. But make no mistake, this is no laughing matter, which is why in the next few days, you\u2019re breaking into his place of business and stealing a hexagon shaped container that he keeps a record of all his dealings in. Don\u2019t bother trying to open that though, you\u2019d need magic. Just bring it back here.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so got any idea where he keeps it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I imagine he\u2019ll probably have it in some sort of safe. Don\u2019t know where that would be either, but it has to be close since I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d keep it in a bank and would definitely want it close to him.\n\nYou start laughing.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Franklins asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to go steal something that is apparently magical and you don\u2019t have any idea where this item is in the place. Not to mention if this container is magically sealed, I have to believe he\u2019s probably got it in some sort of safe that has magic protection as well if its that important. That means I\u2019m going to need special tools for that job and more time to acquire them.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou work as a fucking locksmith!\u201d\n\u201cYeah and while the old guy I work for doesn\u2019t ask me too many questions, I can\u2019t just start taking specialized magic lock breaker from the job without some explanation, unless you\u2019re asking me to steal those too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t give a shit what you gotta do! You need to get into that evil fucker\u2019s office and grab the container and get it back here!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you keep going on about evil, but all of this seems pretty fucking shady. I mean granted I don\u2019t doubt that Reynolds isn\u2019t an asshole given the stories I\u2019ve heard, but how is what you\u2019re planning to do any better? Seems pretty hypocritical that you gave me grief about my background and here you are a self proclaimed follower of Joachim scheming to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDAMNIT MAN DON\u2019T YOU KNOW ANYTHING? I just told you the man is DEMONIC SHIT!\u201d Franklins stands up to shout at you.\n\u201cWait\u2026you weren\u2019t just saying that as a casual description of how much of an asshole he is?\u201d\n\u201cNO. He\u2019s a fucking DEMON. Okay, perhaps half demon, but he\u2019s demonic shit and MY kind have been fighting his for a lot longer than you could ever think about!\u201d\n\nFranklins suddenly sits back down and begins cursing to himself and you feel like you\u2019ve heard more than he meant to tell you.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly do you mean your kind\u2026wait, are YOU human?\u201d\n\u201cYes! No! Fuck! I hate to lie! (Sigh) Damnit, I didn\u2019t want to get into this\u2026I\u2019m half celestial.\u201d\n\u201cCelestial? So like an angel? YOU\u2019RE an angel?\u201d\n\u201cNo you idiot. I just told you I\u2019m only half. Just like Reynolds is only half demon. Doesn\u2019t matter though, we are mortal enemies as has always been the way.\u201d\n\u201cWow. You don\u2019t hear about angels too often.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe if you attended the church of Joachim, that wouldn\u2019t be the case you faithless heathen. As I said, I am only half celestial. My foolish father gave up his otherworldly home to be with my mother\u2026but we\u2019re getting off topic\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait a moment! Then that means Yvette\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, she has celestial blood as well. It\u2019s probably why she has magic potential. It\u2019s probably also why she was always a bit on the trusting side. I never got any of that, all I got was a strong sense of right and wrong and fairly good health all throughout my life. Never been sick once. Better than nothing I suppose and before you even ask, no she doesn\u2019t know any of this and you better keep it that way.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t tell her though.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a fucking burden knowing that\u2019s why! Because I know I have to live up to some damn ideal that I can\u2019t hope to achieve. Hell, my own father didn\u2019t achieve it and HE was a full blood! I know Yvette and if she knew about all this, she would have wanted to go out on a crusade to right wrongs and all that bullshit with her magical powers and promptly gotten herself killed in the process. Better that she be a good person in her own small, but safe way.\u201d\n\u201cShe might have surprised you and done great deeds or something.\u201d\n\u201cOh and you\u2019re the expert on good behavior now?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine I don\u2019t know shit about it. But what about Trinity?\u201d\n\u201cShe would have celestial blood too obviously. Though in her case, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been diluted so much with your lowborn mortal blood that she isn\u2019t going to have any potential powers and will most likely just live as a normal human. Lucky her.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe all this new information that\u2019s been dumped on you. It doesn\u2019t seem real, but Yvette\u2019s dad has never been one to lie and if he is indeed half angel like he claims, you guess it\u2019s hard for him to even do so directly. (Omitting the truth and spinning it, is a different story apparently)\n\nAll of this still doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s asking you to do a job, because he doesn\u2019t want to get his hands dirty. Still seems hypocritical to you, not to mention dangerous now that you\u2019re apparently going to be involved in some secret holy war.\n\nIt occurs to you that you could just refuse. He just admitted all this stuff to you. Now you have a secret. What\u2019s he going to do? You know he not going to kill you or even set it up in such a way that would happen. Have you exiled or get rid of you in some way? You don\u2019t see that happening either.

I mean I just blabbed a big secret to you and you didn\u2019t even try to use it as leverage against me to weasel out of our deal, which I half expected you to do.

If he\u2019s as evil as you keep claiming, isn\u2019t it better that you just get rid of him as quickly as possible before he can do any real damage?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a slippery slope. Sure, you may even be right. I abuse my power to eliminate an obvious evil. No harm done. What about next time though? Maybe the next person isn\u2019t demon spawn. Maybe he isn\u2019t even as bad, but is just in my way. Will I resist the temptation? I don\u2019t know and neither do you. I sometimes look at this city and even though it\u2019s probably one of the better bastions of civilization in this forsaken land, I sometimes still see the decay and rot underneath. It\u2019s always there even to a minor degree. Part or the curse of being half angel I suppose, but I\u2019m trying to maintain what order I can without lowering my own standards and I\u2019m already failing horribly at it. I can\u2019t afford to fail even more.\u201d Franklins remarks.\n\nFranklins goes back to his drink and you search you mind of a way to help while still trying to fall within his weird angel guidelines. (Or maybe it\u2019s just his own weird personal code that he\u2019s placed upon himself for misguided reasons)\n\n\u201cThe two goons Mr. Reynolds has. Why don\u2019t you have them arrested? I know you said Reynolds has influence, but I gotta believe his two thugs are probably shady enough that they could at least be held on suspicion right?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026Reynolds\u2019 son has been a minor suspect in some suspicious murders. As for the ogre, I think he\u2019s busted up a few bars. While I\u2019m sure the militia could hold them both for a little while, maybe even a week, but they would be out in a very short period. And I guarantee they won\u2019t turn on Reynolds if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t need them too, just need them out of the way since I\u2019m betting at least one of them is acting as an on duty guard even when his office is closed. I think with them out of the picture, it will lessen the risk to pull this off. I just need more time than what you suggested.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re still going to do it?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, a deal\u2019s a deal. You didn\u2019t say shit about my past to Yvette, so I\u2019m going to do this favor for you. Besides, I\u2019d be lying if the challenge isn\u2019t stirring up old interest at this point. Just let me know when those two goons are out of the way. I\u2019ll be working on shit from my end until then.\u201d\n\nFranklins is so surprised by your helpfulness he doesn\u2019t even have any snide comments towards you for the rest of your time you speak with him. He\u2019s got some reservations about what you propose, but he says if you think you know what you\u2019re doing, he\u2019s going to trust you.\n\nYou leave Franklins place wondering if you\u2019ve maybe lost a bit of your mind for agreeing to this task, but then you realize, you were probably just getting a little bored.\n\nStill, a lot is riding on your plan and you have to be very careful because this isn\u2019t just you now. It\u2019s your whole family you could potentially lose. It doesn\u2019t make things easier that part of this plan indirectly involves Yvette.\n\nYou don\u2019t exactly keep up on all of Yvette\u2019s magic studies and such, but you know that she was recently working on something relating to invisibility. Of course you\u2019re really going to have to approach this carefully or this is going to make things infinitely worse. The only reason why you\u2019re considering it is because quite frankly you haven\u2019t exactly been as active as you used to be and have probably gotten slightly out of shape.\n\nIf you\u2019re invisible however, it takes some of the pressure off of things like not having lightning reflexes and the quickest feet any more.\n\nLater as you\u2019re settling down for the night, you address the subject to Yvette who is reading something in bed as she usually does.\n\n\u201cSo, uh\u2026you mentioned something about working on something related to invisibility?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? Yes I am.\u201d Yvette says not looking up from her book.\n\u201cI remember you mentioning something a week ago or so about it. Is this a new spell or potion or something else?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a potion actually or rather an attempt to strengthen the existing formula.\u201d\n\u201cSomething wrong with the old one?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, invisibility potions are hard to make due to the ingredients, which means they\u2019re rare to begin with, but the bigger problem is they have never been very effective.\u201d Yvette says now looking at you.\n\u201cWhat, like they only turn you invisible and your clothing is still visible or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cHah, that can happen with the wrong ingredients, but the main obstacle is they don\u2019t last very long. Usually ten seconds tops. Most wizards won\u2019t even bother making them due to the long, tedious process involved for such a short payoff. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out a way to extend that to at least a half hour.\u201d\n\u201cSo is it easier to just cast the spell?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but only on yourself. Casting the spell on others can really take it out of you as far as upkeep is concerned. It\u2019s probably why the research on the potion was made. So\u2026why all this sudden interest in my work? You don\u2019t tend to ask most of the time.\u201d\n\u201cWell to be honest when you speak to me about this stuff, it usually sounds so complicated that I feel sort of dumb.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! You are most certainly not dumb! I mean you had the intelligence to go to Klyton University at one time. I always said you should go back and finish your degree in\u2026engineering wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I just don\u2019t have time for that now. Besides, I\u2019d rather spend my free time spending it with Trinity rather than in a class room.\u201d\n\u201cYou are an attentive father.\u201d Yvette says with a smile.\n\u201cI try, but anyway I was also asking because I was wondering if you could help me in a job.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\nYou explain to her that some government associate of her father wants some elaborate security system, because he doesn\u2019t want any militia guards assigned to his house. You aren\u2019t exactly sure what it\u2019s all about, something about death threats from an unknown ex-government worker. He says he isn\u2019t worried, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to update his security so he asked for you and he wants the best.\n\nYou explain that you want to test the security you\u2019re installing will be good against someone who is invisible.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t the locks still keep them out? I mean even if someone is invisible, they aren\u2019t intangible.\u201d Yvette asks.\n\u201cTrue, but just in case they still manage to get in, I\u2019ve actually have been working on something that detects movement. I guess it\u2019s experimental, sort like what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t know. Well I mean I suppose I can help, though I\u2019m not sure how.\u201d\n\u201cWell you said you made a bunch of potions of invisibility. Just give me about ten of them and I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait. Are you going to drink them? You can\u2019t just drink ten invisibility potions one right after another! You\u2019d get sick!\u201d\n\u201cWell you said they didn\u2019t last long. I\u2019ll pace myself. Wait, haven\u2019t you been making progress on the formula?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah a little bit. I created one that last up to around twenty minutes give or take\u2026wait you don\u2019t want to try that do you? It\u2019s only in the experimental stages and I\u2019ve only tested it on qweepas! You don\u2019t know how many died before I got that right! Its a good thing the university has an infestation of the critters otherwise I might have run out of easy test subjects.\u201d\n\u201cWell I trust you. Just give me a couple of those improved potions and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA couple?! No, if you were going to get any, you\u2019d get ONE. And I still don\u2019t think that would be a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to test it on humans at some point right? I could help you with this, while you help me!\n\nYvette thinks about that proposal for a moment.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose it could speed things along\u2026but I dunno\u2026I\u2019d never forgive myself if something went wrong. But if you want to risk it, I\u2019ll give you one like I said.\u201d Yvette says.\n\nThis is a question of how fast do you think you\u2019ll be and whether you want to risk drinking something that could quite possibly turn you into a purple frog with a cat head or just outright kill you instantly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the experimental potion", "result": "This whole thing is a gamble, might as well go big.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the experimental, as I said, I trust your abilities and this will help you with your own research. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d You say and give Yvette a kiss, though she still seems a bit worried.\n\u201cMaybe I should go with you when you do this.\u201d Yvette says.\n\u201cNo! I mean, no because this guy doesn\u2019t want anyone else around who isn\u2019t directly working on this and he still has to work shit out on his end and get things prepared. You know how these government types are with their hurry up and wait shit. Chances are, it\u2019s going to be a sudden thing that I\u2019m going to have to drop everything I\u2019m working on at the time. I just want to have the potion when I do need it.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well okay. I\u2019ll get it for you tomorrow when I come back from work. You don\u2019t need it sooner I hope.\u201d\n\u201cNope, like I said, it\u2019s going to be awhile.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but if I make progress in between that time and discover something wrong I don\u2019t want you drinking it!\u201d\n\nWell now you just hope that doesn\u2019t happen before Yvette\u2019s father lets you know that Reynolds\u2019 goons are both out of the picture.\n\nAs it turns out, you don\u2019t have to wait too long and Franklins is pretty efficient in that regard. He informs you that from what he heard, Reynolds protested very loudly about his son and the ogre being arrested and has already claimed that he is going to make sure heads are going to roll for this slander and injustice. Franklins tells you his name predictably came up in the blame game, so he wants you to go get that container before Reynolds starts acting on his threats.\n\nYou gather up some extra supplies from work. Ned isn\u2019t really going to notice and the guy is practically on the verge of willing you his place of business when he dies anyway. Even when you say you need one of the special magic lock breakers he hardly bats an eye and just tells you to be careful with it since they\u2019re very hard to acquire, let alone make.\n\nLater that week when you finally have everything you need and feel prepared, you tell Yvette that you\u2019re going to be working a little late on this paper pusher\u2019s security since this is the moment. She\u2019s of course still worried about you, but also slightly eager to find out what you\u2019ll experience and reminds you to tell her everything.\n\nYou linger around in the neighborhood where Mr. Reynolds maintains his place of business. In the old days you might have been a little concerned about getting mugged in the area or running afoul of some sort of thugs while you wait, but things are lot more cleaned up without the Crimson Talons around and the militia keeping on top of things. Probably just as well that you gave up your profession when you did\u2026so to speak.\n\nEventually Mr. Reynold\u2019s place of business closes down for the day and unfortunately just as you figured he doesn\u2019t leave. Probably has a whole living area to himself in the building, which means more caution is going to be needed on your part while you search for a safe because you\u2019re going in totally dry.\n\nYou decide to do this the old fashioned way and stealthily break in and only use the potion if you get into trouble. You\u2019re still a bit hesitant to use it after all.\n\nOne thing you wish is there that there was a back door to the place, but you looked around earlier for one and no luck. Not even a window, or least not one you could easily climb up to. As the streets become less populated, you head to the front door and work on the lock. It\u2019s actually not difficult and you\u2019re in pretty quickly.\n\nYou have to put yourself back in that calm mentality when you used to do this before, but it\u2019s a lot more difficult because there are so many things that could go wrong. That\u2019s not even counting that this guy is a half fucking demon. Who knows what sort of powers he really has?\n\nYou do your best to press forward and just get on with it. You\u2019re just glad you had the forethought to go to the bathroom before you did this.\n\nYou sneak about his office first, hoping that maybe he keeps a safe in here, but so far all you\u2019re finding is locked drawers with papers and not much else. You do find a fancy looking pistol under his desk. Its way nicer than the one you have at home and has multiple barrels, (You sort of wish you brought it with you) probably a custom job. You figure since you\u2019re here stealing shit anyway, you take it.\n\nYou eventually finish going through everything you can in the office area and that\u2019s when you realize you\u2019re going to have to search Mr. Reynolds\u2019 living quarters.\n\nYou give yourself a few moments to mentally prepare yourself and then head through a door where you see some stairs going up and down. You forgot that there might be a cellar to this place. Hoping that the safe might be down there, you decide to try it first.\n\nThe cellar isn\u2019t cluttered like you\u2019d think it would be. In fact there isn\u2019t much here at all other than a few tables and chair. Though it looks like there are also some shackles and several what could only be torture instruments down here. For deadbeats and others that get on Reynolds\u2019 bad side no doubt.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to give up, and resign yourself to searching in the demon\u2019s inner sanctum, you spot a small hidden door in the floor. Upon closer inspection, it\u2019s definitely a safe of some sort.\n\n\u201cShit, this isn\u2019t even state of the art.\u201d You say to yourself and start trying to open it with your regular tools. You don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re going to be so lucky to find what you\u2019re looking for, but when you finally get it open, you\u2019re pleasantly surprised.\n\n\u201cYag is certainly smiling on me today.\u201d You say even though you\u2019ve never been one to place too much stock in the gods, but really is a good stroke of luck. You take the black hexagon container and place it in your bag. Time to leave.\n\nYou start walking up the stairs and then suddenly one of the steps breaks and your leg nearly goes through it. It\u2019s all you can do to try to hang on to the nearby railing so you don\u2019t hurt yourself any further even though you still take a tumble backwards. You\u2019re just lucky you didn\u2019t break your leg or your neck, though you aren\u2019t so lucky in that you were completely silent since you did shout in pain briefly before stopping yourself, not to mention all the other noise.\n\nYou\u2019re sure that probably got Mr. Reynolds\u2019 attention. If he wasn\u2019t awake now, he is now.\n\nYou quickly stand up from the bottom of the basement stairs and already hear noise coming from above your location.\n\n\u201cI hope this works.\u201d You say and take out the invisibility potion and drink it. You feel a strange sensation and half think that you\u2019re going to fall down the stairs from the temporary wooziness. (Though maybe some of that is from the fall)\n\nYou look at yourself, or at rather your hands and arms and even in this torch lighting you can\u2019t see them anymore. A further glance down your body and you can\u2019t see that either. You\u2019re guessing it is working.\n\nYou\u2019re about to make your way back up the stairs, but then that\u2019s when you see a figure standing at the top of them. Mr. Reynolds is there with what looks to be a musket.\n\n\u201cI know someone\u2019s down here, you might as well come out now and make this quick.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s aiming downward, but hasn\u2019t shot you yet. It\u2019s a clear line of sight so the potion must definitely be working. However he\u2019s in the way and you aren\u2019t going to get past him as he makes his way cautiously down.\n\nYou back up deeper into the basement and figure you might be able to sneak around him. The problem is he isn\u2019t moving much further in and is now just standing near the bottom of the stairs pointing his weapon into the darkness.\n\n\u201cGot all the time in the world. The longer you make me wait, the worse it\u2019s going to be for you...hmmm\u2026.let me guess\u2026whoever you are, you\u2019re working for Franklins aren\u2019t you? Yeah, it all makes sense now with my two loyal workers being recently arrested.\u201d Mr. Reynolds remarks.\n\nHe keeps looking around from his position like he\u2019s trying to see something, but it\u2019s not that huge of a basement and if you weren\u2019t invisible you wouldn\u2019t have many places to hide.\n\nStill, this potion isn\u2019t going to last forever and you really aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re going to be able to sneak around him.\n\nOf course, you do have that fancy pistol of his that you picked up. Though you weren\u2019t here to assassinate the guy, you were just supposed to steal from him and who knows if bullets are going to work on him? There\u2019s also the fact that you haven\u2019t actually killed anyone since Klint and it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s a major part of your nature though this is a desperate situation, just like it was with Klint.", "action_results": [{"action": "Sneak around him", "result": "In your heart you\u2019ve always been a thief, never a killer. You\u2019re going to sneak around him.\n\nYou move forward cautiously as Reynolds continues to squint in your direction. He can\u2019t see you as far as you can tell.\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d he suddenly shouts and fires directly at you.\n\nYou feel the burn of lead going into your body and damaging vital organs before falling to the floor. You moan and groan in pain while Reynolds advances on your position. He stands back as he looks on the floor in your direction.\n\n\u201cI figured someone was playing hide and seek. Unusual invisibility you have there. Usually potions don\u2019t last that long and if you were a wizard, my shot would have broken your concentration and I doubt there is another wizard lurking nearby. It\u2019s a good thing these ol\u2019 eyes can detect heat if one is close enough.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Mr. Reynolds still can\u2019t quite make everything out, but it\u2019s good enough that he can see you well enough and starts roughly grabbing at your hands, which are attempting to go for his fancy pistol that you stole.\n\nYou are strong enough to resist, but only initially. Mr. Reynolds eventually manages to grab the pistol and in the ensuing struggle he shoots you with it. This time the shot is fatal.\n\nThe last thing you hear is Mr. Reynolds cursing that he\u2019ll be unable to get any more information from you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Shoot Reynolds", "result": "You think how this guy is half demon and probably is the asshole that Franklin made him out to be. You then think about how this is the same guy who messed with your family over their old inn. You also think about how you want to get out of this alive. And finally you think about your wife and daughter and how you want to see them again.\n\nYeah, fuck this guy.\n\nYou step slightly to the right of where he\u2019s pointing his musket and fire the pistol. The first shot hits him the chest and predictably he lets off a shot of his own before falling down.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026fuck\u2026invisi\u2026\u201d he starts to utter before you move closer and put a couple more shots into him, this time his head. He doesn\u2019t die immediately, instead he makes these horrible inhuman noises and begins flailing about. He tries to even wildly hit you with his musket, but you\u2019re far enough away and empty your pistol which you nearly drop due to the heat it\u2019s giving off.\n\nReynolds stops making his ghastly dying sounds when enough of his brains are on the wall. Seeing that he isn\u2019t breathing anymore or moving, you quickly step over his body and hurry up the stairs and out the building.\n\nAlong the way, you smash the pistol against a wall and start throwing pieces of it in various trash bins and drains in the street as you head back to Franklins place. You\u2019re a paranoid mess the whole time, thinking that someone is watching you and forgetting that you\u2019re still invisible. Eventually you realize you\u2019re able to see parts of your body again so you guess the potion is wearing off or worn off. Good thing its late and aren\u2019t too many folks around otherwise just suddenly appearing like that might have caused some shock. Doesn\u2019t help your worry and paranoia though.\n\nWhen you get back to Franklins\u2019 home, you beat on the door until he answers. Upon answering, you promptly vomit on his front door step and his shoeless feet.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d he says.\n\u201cApologies\u2026.ugh\u2026it all caught up to me\u2026I guess\u2026\u201d you say still feeling a bit queasy and coughing.\n\u201c(Sigh) Shit\u2026well I hope you have good news at least.\u201d\n\nAfter a bit of clean up, you finally sit down and are calm enough to tell Franklins everything, but the first thing you do is hand him the container as promised. He seems so pleased by this that you telling him a problem cropped up doesn\u2019t even seem to bother him.\n\n\u201cDid he see you or something? Don\u2019t worry about that, when the shit he\u2019s been involved in gets out, nobody will even believe him since he\u2019ll be arrested right away.\u201d Franklins says.\n\u201cUm, yeah I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cWell as I said, there was a problem\u2026and there was nothing I could do about it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re starting to concern me, what the hell do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean I shot him.\u201d\n\u201cYou shot him?!\u201d\n\u201cSeveral times actually.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead?\u201d\n\u201cUm, pretty much. Yeah.\u201d\n\nFranklins lies back in his chair exhaling deeply almost in shock.\n\n\u201cUm, nobody saw me though. I was invisible the entire time.\u201d You add.\n\u201cWell thank Joachim for small favors. How were you invisi\u2026you know what never mind. (Sigh) Shit. Well\u2026I guess this doesn\u2019t even matter now. Damnit I didn\u2019t ask you to kill the guy!\u201d Franklins says.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I had a fucking choice! I fully intended on just stealing that container, but shit happened and I was put in a position of either completing this shitty job or possibly being Reynolds\u2019 victim! Besides isn\u2019t this better? I mean hell he\u2019s completely gone now!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I guess so and I don\u2019t shed any tears obviously. But let\u2019s just say I really wanted him alive so I could see the look on his face when I took everything away from him and he could do nothing about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell if it\u2019s any consolation, the expression on his face when he died was pretty horrific, though not nearly as bad as his screaming.\u201d\n\u201cShit, what the hell did you do exactly\u2026again never mind. Well I\u2019m still going to hang on to this for safekeeping. Maybe there is still information inside that might be of use. As for you, if you weren\u2019t seen I guess you\u2019re good too. Though if something is coming your way I really will try my best to give it a detour. Now, you\u2019re SURE he\u2019s dead right?\u201d\n\u201cUnless he can regenerate from severe head wounds and missing brain matter, yeah he\u2019s dead. And again, he didn\u2019t see me since I was invisible the whole time.\u201d\n\u201cWell if the worst happens and he is still alive, I still got this container. Okay, well I guess you better get home. I trust you have a good story for Yvette.\u201d\n\u201cI have a story. I told I would be working late, but she probably didn\u2019t think it would be this late.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have any problems I suppose you can incorporate me into the excuse. I\u2019ll back you up. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not doing anything like this ever again. Not for you, not for anyone.\u201d\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019m not asking. And thanks. You\u2019re a better son in law than I could have hoped for. Maybe you\u2019re a godless heathen, but you stuck your neck out and even killed a demon spawn in the process. That\u2019s gotta for something when judgment day comes.\u201d\n\nAt this point you take your leave and hurry back home as soon as possible. Naturally it\u2019s very late so everyone is asleep. You attempt to get into bed silently, but your sneaking skills fail to evade Yvette\u2019s notice even though she was asleep.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026you\u2019re home\u2026you were gone all night.\u201d She groggily says.\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m pissed about it too, the bean counter was an asshole that wanted everything done a certain way and\u2026ugh\u2026I don\u2019t even want to think about it right now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t then. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here now. Come closer to me, you\u2019re too far away.\u201d\n\nYou move closer in the bed so Yvette can cuddle up against you. Normally you tend to like staying a bit free, but after tonight, you\u2019re all for Yvette\u2019s warm soft body.\n\n\u201cOh, did you use the potion?\u201d she asks as she starts drifting back off.\n\u201cYeah, worked pretty well. I couldn\u2019t see my own hands when it took effect or anything else on me. I think it lasted about the time you mentioned too.\u201d\n\u201cHuh\u2026that\u2019s odd. You should have still been able to see yourself and just been invisible to others. Hmm, guess that\u2019s a side effect I didn\u2019t know about, considering Qweepas can\u2019t actually speak. (Yawn) I\u2019ll have to make a note tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Yvette returns to her sleep and you\u2019re in her arms again where you definitely want to be and are glad you were able to return to.\n\nSometimes you hate the fact that you\u2019ve had to lie on occasion to her about things, but there is no way you\u2019re losing this life. Not now.\n\nYour days as a rogue are definitely over.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Take the regular potions", "result": "Hopefully, you won\u2019t have to stay invisible for long because you\u2019re not going to risk the experimental.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just take several of the regular ones.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay\u2026but I\u2019m not giving you ten!

You figure since you\u2019re here stealing shit anyway, you take it.\n\nYou eventually finish going through everything you can in the office area and that\u2019s when you realize you\u2019re going to have to search Mr. Reynolds\u2019 living quarters.\n\nYou give yourself a few moments to mentally prepare yourself and then head through a door where you see some stairs going up and down. You forgot that there might be a cellar to this place. Hoping that the safe might be down there, you decide to try it first.\n\nThe cellar isn\u2019t cluttered like you\u2019d think it would be. In fact there isn\u2019t much here at all other than a few tables and chair. Though it looks like there are also some shackles and several what could only be torture instruments down here. For deadbeats and others that get on Reynolds\u2019 bad side no doubt.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to give up, and resign yourself to searching in the demon\u2019s inner sanctum, you spot a small hidden door in the floor. Upon closer inspection, it\u2019s definitely a safe of some sort.\n\n\u201cShit, this isn\u2019t even state of the art.\u201d You say to yourself and start trying to open it with your regular tools. You don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re going to be so lucky to find what you\u2019re looking for, but when you finally get it open, you\u2019re pleasantly surprised.\n\n\u201cYag is certainly smiling on me today.\u201d You say even though you\u2019ve never been one to place too much stock in the gods, but really is a good stroke of luck. You take the black hexagon container and place it in your bag. Time to leave.\n\nYou start walking up the stairs and then suddenly one of the steps breaks and your leg nearly goes through it. It\u2019s all you can do to try to hang on to the nearby railing so you don\u2019t hurt yourself any further even though you still take a tumble backwards. You\u2019re just lucky you didn\u2019t break your leg or your neck, though you aren\u2019t so lucky in that you were completely silent since you did shout in pain briefly before stopping yourself, not to mention all the other noise.\n\nYou\u2019re sure that probably got Mr. Reynolds\u2019 attention. If he wasn\u2019t awake now, he is now.\n\nYou quickly stand up from the bottom of the basement stairs and already hear noise coming from above your location.\n\n\u201cI hope this works.\u201d You say and take out one of the invisibility potions and drink it. You feel a strange sensation and half think that you\u2019re going to fall down the stairs from the temporary wooziness. (Though maybe some of that is from the fall)\n\nYou look at yourself, and don\u2019t see any difference. You can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s working.\n\nYou\u2019re about to make your way back up the stairs, but then that\u2019s when you see a figure standing at the top of them. Mr. Reynolds is there with what looks to be a musket.\n\n\u201cI know someone\u2019s down here, you might as well come out now and make this quick.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s aiming downward, but hasn\u2019t shot you yet. It\u2019s a clear line of sight so the potion must definitely be working. However he\u2019s in the way and you aren\u2019t going to get past him as he makes his way cautiously down.\n\nYou back up deeper into the basement and figure you might be able to sneak around him. The problem is he isn\u2019t moving much further in and is now just standing near the bottom of the stairs pointing his weapon into the darkness.\n\nYou probably could sneak by him or maybe you could just shoot him with the pistol you acquired, but your immediate concern is staying invisible since you\u2019re sure that your time on that is about to run out. You take another potion and chug the contents.\n\nNo sooner have you done so when you start to feel incredibly sick to the point where you actually feel a cramping in your stomach. Yvette wasn\u2019t joking about how quickly these can cause sickness when drunk immediately after each other.\n\nYou try to prevent yourself from retching and begin to go for your pistol since you know you\u2019re going to give your position away by making retching noises.\n\nYou unsteadily fire at Reynolds and hit him just before your vomit all over the floor. You hover over your own puddle of sick gagging and not really noticing if you actually killed Reynolds or not.\n\nAt least not until feel the impact of a shot go into your face causing you to fall backwards.\n\nSomehow you\u2019re still alive, but between the pain and the sickness of the potion, you end up falling unconscious.\n\nEventually your wake up and find yourself tied firmly to a chair. Your still have a slightly queasy feeling, your face still hurts very badly and you can only see out of one eye.\n\nBut all of that is the least of your problems when you see the blurry image of Mr. Reynolds standing nearby next to the table full of torture instruments.\n\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re finally awake. Now we can get started. You know, you really are a spitting image of your father\u2026well except for the new hole in your face. How is he doing anyway?\u201d Mr. Reynolds says.\n\u201cMgh, wai\u2026t\u2026gh\u2026\u201d is about all you can groan right now.\n\n\u201cWell, doesn\u2019t matter I suppose. I\u2019ll find out everything I need to in a day or so I imagine. Not that I really need to since I already know you\u2019re working for Franklins. I swear that old hypocrite couldn\u2019t do something himself so he gets his lowly son in law to do it for him. If I were in your position I\u2019d be really pissed at him right now. This is all his fault you know. He seems to think because of my heritage that I have some sinister plan for this city when that\u2019s far from the truth. All I want to see is it to achieve its fullest potential.\u201d\n\u201cPle\u2026ase\u2026I\u2026won\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t what? Tell anyone you were here? Tell Franklins? Get revenge? Of course you won\u2019t because you won\u2019t be leaving here alive. Really the only reason you\u2019re still breathing is because I want to find out a few more things about your loved ones before you die. You committed a crime against me. Not only did you shoot me in the fucking shoulder, but you tried to steal some very personal and valuable property. Now I\u2019m going to take EVERYTHING from you. I know you have a wife and daughter. They will be easy enough to find, though I can imagine Franklins will realize with your disappearance that something has gone wrong and will do everything in his power to protect them, so it might not be easy to get to them first. So let\u2019s start with your parents and their whereabouts\u2026oh I do hope they are still alive\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Reynolds begins his torture and you try to hold out for as long as you can, but eventually you fail and tell him everything.\n\nYour failure unfortunately still doesn\u2019t involve your immediate death. Mr. Reynolds keeps you alive in his basement where eventually his son (who gets out of being in militia custody) takes over the routine torture and he\u2019s not as nice as his father was\u2026\n\nYou are completely broken by the time Reynolds tosses your mother and fathers\u2019 heads at you. You never thought you\u2019d see them again, and certainly not like this.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have any tears left to grieve.\n\nIt is a small mercy that your body just gives out before Reynolds can do the same to your wife and daughter.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Refuse to help", "result": "If this was something reasonable maybe you\u2019d be more willing to help, but this hypocrite is going to get you killed. Hell, maybe even on purpose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing your dirty work, especially given how the way you treat me. I\u2019ve already proven myself to you for years now anyway.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Snort) So you want credit for acting like you should be acting anyway? Franklins replies.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m not going live in fear of your blackmailing anymore. You want this done, you need to do it yourself, hypocrite.\u201d\n\u201cYou should watch how you speak to me.\u201d\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll expose my past to Yvette? I\u2019ll take that risk, then she can find out everything that YOU\u2019VE been keeping from her. You two are only just now on better speaking terms thanks to me. What happens when she finds out the truth? You think she\u2019ll ever want to have anything to do with you again? I mean shit; you knew about me being an ex-criminal and didn\u2019t tell her immediately. That would be grounds alone for her to be pissed at you, let alone this new information about her being part angel. You going to also deprive your grand daughter of her father as well?\u201d\n\nFranklins just sits in silence with a stare that could kill if it could. (Fortunately, he didn\u2019t say he had those sorts of celestial powers)\n\n\u201cNow you got two options. You either let me go out that door and leave me alone in peace where upon we will never speak about this ever again or you can go ahead and try to kill me at some point and if you go that route, you better make sure you get it right. What is NOT going to happen is you telling me what to do like a puppet.\u201d\n\nFranklins continues to stare at you in silence. You half expect him to get up and try to kill you with his bare hands, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFine. Go. This is my fault for placing trust in someone of your low moral fiber anyway. Oh and don\u2019t worry, your miserable life is safe.\u201d Franklins says dismissively.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure about this at first, but given that Franklins isn\u2019t even prepared to kill Reynolds who is a mortal enemy and demon to boot, you get the impression that he\u2019s telling the truth.\n\nYou head back home and try to forget about everything that transpired. Even though you\u2019re supposedly in the clear now, you still have a feeling of worry for the next few months.\n\nStill, you try to keep your mind occupied with your every day family life, which continues as normal with no odd deviations.\n\nBy the time a year passes, your concerns of any reprisal by Franklin are nearly gone.\n\nYear 32\n\nYou have mixed feelings about all this.\n\nMost of them negative about this situation of course, but somewhere in the back of your mind, you always knew this day would come. Maybe not like this, but something like it.\n\n\u201cStop here.\u201d Franklins remarks to the carriage driver and two of Franklins men grab you and throw you out of the carriage.\n\nYou have no idea where you are all you do know is you\u2019ve been riding for quite awhile, so you can\u2019t be anywhere near Klyton anymore. Maybe somewhere to the north? The air is a lot colder, but then you\u2019re naked so it would be slightly chilly no matter where you were.\n\nYou hear the sounds of footsteps approach as you attempt to stand back up. A boot to your side kicks you back down, followed by a hand roughly taking off your blindfold. You see Franklins staring down at you, even in your beaten and naked state you\u2019d try to attack him if you could, unfortunately your hands are firmly tied behind you.\n\n\u201cI should have known after reading about Reynolds winding up dead a year ago that you decided to abandon your so called code completely. Guess you took my advice and decided to do your own dirty work after all.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s just say I saw the point of view on one of your crude arguments that fateful day. Plus as you pointed out, he was part demon and killing him was after all in my duty as a being of higher morality and conscience.\u201d Franklins responds.\n\u201cStill deluded I see. Snatching me up with nobody around and dragging me way the hell out\u2026wherever we are just to kill me seems a bit complex though. Couldn\u2019t you have just had me killed quietly in the city? I\u2019m sure you have the means of disposing of a dead body.\u201d You say.\n\nFranklins smiles a bit and pulls out a knife.\n\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t abandon any code and you\u2019re not dying here\u2026well at least not by my hand.\u201d He says and tosses the knife next to you before continuing.\n\n\u201cThis is exile. I told you I\u2019m no murderer. I\u2019m giving you a chance to live.\u201d\n\u201cA chance to live? I\u2019m fucking naked in the wilderness!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cYes, but you still have a chance. Call it punishment for all those years you freely stole from hard working folks. If you live, well then I guess Joachim has seen fit to absolve you of your sins.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. You haven\u2019t changed at all. You\u2019re still a fucking hypocrite hiding behind some code to justify your actions.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026perhaps\u2026but then I am only part human. I have my flaws that Joachim will surely judge on that day of reckoning.\u201d\n\u201cYou might want to be on the safe side and just kill me, because if I DO survive this, I\u2019m coming back for you.\u201d\n\nFranklins at this point chuckles.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you will. First of all if you do come back to Klyton, I\u2019ll definitely know about it and I WILL have you killed for the punishment for returning from exile is death in accordance with the law. Second, even if you do manage to sneak in, don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to somehow get my daughter on your side. I\u2019ve already taken care of that. Right now she knows everything about you and believes you\u2019ve fled the city due to being under suspicion of several crimes.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d never believe it!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cShe already does. Thanks to you, I have a better relationship with her now and she\u2019s never known me to be a liar. Besides, it\u2019s not lying\u2026you were a thief.\u201d\n\nYou start cursing Franklins out, but he\u2019s unmoved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d save your strength. Night will be coming soon and there are worse than wolves out here. Goodbye son in law and don\u2019t worry about Trinity, I will of course make sure she, along with my daughter are well looked after.\u201d\n\nWith those last words, Franklins gets back in the carriage and takes off.\n\nThe first thing you do as you watch the carriage disappear in the distance, is maneuver yourself to try to cut your ropes with the knife that Franklins provided.\n\nYou still have no idea where you are; there isn\u2019t even a road nearby. Franklin\u2019s carriage apparently had heavy duty wheels to endure the rough wilderness.\n\nYou struggle to cut your ropes, but it\u2019s a tedious process and not easy. The cold is nipping at you and the light is going out. To top it all off, you think you hear something making noises in the distance and it doesn\u2019t sound like a wolf.\n\nBy the time you get your hands free, what was making that sound has gotten closer.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what it is, but all you see is its eyes and teeth before it manages to chase you down and devour you.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Tell her the truth", "result": "Best to start a new life with a clean slate.\n\n\u201cYvette, if we\u2019re going to be together I fell like it\u2019s best if I tell you EVERYTHING.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Yvette responds.\n\u201cYeah, okay where to start\u2026\u201d\n\nYou go into your past, though you still leave out a few details. (Like having to leave your town for murder instead of theft) In general you\u2019re truthful though. You\u2019re rolling the dice here and while you\u2019re explaining, you aren\u2019t sure how she\u2019s even taking it.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to lay it all out there because I\u2019m ready to turn over a new leaf. I want a life with you and I want that life to have no secrets between us.\u201d\n\nYvette still says nothing; her face just has an expression of shock on it.\n\n\u201cYvette?\u201d you say.\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah. Well\u2026yeah\u2026\u201d she starts to say.\n\nThis isn\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cYvette, please say something.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say? This is pretty damn serious! I mean how CAN I trust you? Up until THIS moment you\u2019ve lied about everything!\u201d Yvette responds.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not lying now! I\u2019m telling the truth here. I\u2019m no longer going to be a thief, I\u2019m going to go look for real work and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, I can\u2019t deal with this right now. I\u2019ve got other things on my mind and running into you was a surprise to begin with. Obviously it was a mistake to even admit I had some faint feelings for you at one time. I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cWell can we talk about this again later?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Look, if you ARE serious, then by all means turn your life around and become a productive member of society. I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re that bad of a person\u2026but I can\u2019t be with someone I can\u2019t trust and I can\u2019t trust you. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is again. Doing the right thing and getting no accolades, just a kick in the fucking face.\n\nDisappointed with how this entire miserable day has turned out you head back to your place Joachim\u2019s church (With the militia following you the entire time of course).\n\nYou spend the next few days on your usual routine of sneaking around trying to lose the militia as you perform your work at the university. You might as well considering you can\u2019t leave the city. If things actually been different with Yvette, you probably would have tried to find a real job, but now? What\u2019s the point?\n\nYou figure it\u2019s free to sleep and eat at the church so you might as well just endure it until the Crimson Talons finally get busted and the militia backs off your ass so you can leave this fucking city.\n\nOne day in your corner of the church sleeping area, your light sleeping reflexes kick in and you grab a little arm reaching at you.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing you little thief?\u201d you say to the little girl who you\u2019ve just grabbed. She looks at you with wide eyes, but doesn\u2019t scream surprisingly.\n\n\u201cNothing! I\u2019m not a thief and I wasn\u2019t reaching for you, I was just trying to pet Pink Eyes!\u201d she says.\n\u201cPink Eyes?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, the funny rat with big teeth by your head.\u201d\n\nYou turn your head slightly and see Elana sniffing near you. It would seem she located you. You release your grip on the girl\u2019s arm who stands back as you slowly sit up rubbing your eyes. Elana squeaks a few times and finds a less open place to be.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I stopped you kid. Elana here isn\u2019t just a regular rat, she\u2019s a qweepa and she also doesn\u2019t tend to let people just pet her. In fact she\u2019s more likely to eat your fingers.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t do that with me. When I saw her, I gave her a little piece of bread I had from breakfast and she nuzzled my hand a bit after she ate the bread. Then I played with her a bit before she ran over to you. Is she your pet?\u201d the little girl asks.\n\u201cYeah I guess you could say that. Though apparently she\u2019s a little traitor if she\u2019s being nice to anyone that feeds her. Guess I\u2019m no position to speak ill of rats though. Wait, did you say you already had breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s almost time for them to serve lunch now. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and see you creep in here. Do you have some sort of night job?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that. Where are your parents?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s out looking for work. I\u2026um don\u2019t know who my dad is.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well I got stuff to do, so off you go kid.\u201d\n\u201cCan I play with Pink Eyes while you\u2019re gone?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah sure I guess if she isn\u2019t chewing your face off. I wouldn\u2019t call attention to her though, not sure what the animal policy is in this place. And if she doesn\u2019t want to be fussed with, then I\u2019d leave her be. Like I said, she isn\u2019t usually this friendly to other people.\u201d\n\nYou leave the little girl and Elana and step out of the church before Virgil or some other Joachim follower can ask you to do anything. You head to the university seeing as you don\u2019t have anything better planned at the moment.\n\nOf course as soon as you start heading that way, militia is on your ass already and this time they don\u2019t just follow you, they actually come up to you and start throwing their weight around.\n\n\u201cHey criminal scum, we\u2019re on to you.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cYeah I know that already. Been through all this with your captain.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you fucking understand!\u201d he says again, pushing you hard this time.\n\u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m not doing anything!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cBullshit! We know where you\u2019ve been going even though you THINK you\u2019ve been eluding us. You go up to that fancy university. Whatcha going up there for? I know it ain\u2019t to take any fucking classes. We haven\u2019t caught you in the act yet, but it won\u2019t be long.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be taking down the Crimson Talons?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that. They\u2019ll be facing justice soon, just like YOU will be. Seein\u2019 you soon asshole.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is, final proof that the militia consists of a bunch of unyielding dicks that are not going to EVER leave you alone. You truly have to get out of this city.\n\nYour original plan was to wait until they finally took out the Talons, but they seem to be taking their sweet ass time about it. You suppose if you really wanted to get out, you could take the sewers and leave through the secret exit that the Talons use to get in and out of the city with no fuss.\n\nYeah, seems like a plan, though you figure you\u2019ll wait until it gets darker. In the meantime you head back to the church.\n\nWhen you arrive back to your sleeping area you see that little girl playing with Elana and giving her some of her food. Looks like even your pet has abandoned you. Though considering you\u2019re leaving soon, it\u2019s just as well she seems to have found a new owner.\n\nLacking any more motivation to do anything until tonight, you decide to get some more sleep.\n\nLater\u2026\n\nYou suddenly grab a little arm reaching for you.\n\n\u201cGirl\u2026you REALLY need to stop doing that!\u201d you say waking up and letting the girl\u2019s arm go.\n\u201cPlease, my mom is missing and I dunno who to ask for help!\u201d the little girl says frantically\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom, she hasn\u2019t returned! She ALWAYS returns before now! She promised she\u2019d never stay out late like this again and I know she wasn\u2019t lying!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, calm down. What the hell happened?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point the little girl starts breaking down in tears and some nearby folks trying to sleep start shushing you.\n\nThis certainly wasn\u2019t anything you had in mind to deal with right now. From what you can tell it\u2019s pitch black outside. You slept way longer than you intended to and now you\u2019ve got a little girl begging you for help.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get out of the city", "result": "This is sad and all, but you\u2019ve got more important problems.

Shhh. Look, do you know where you mom might have went or where she goes to look for work?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, mostly the taverns?\u201d the little girl asks.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go check every tavern in the area then okay? You just stay here and try to get some sleep, or I dunno\u2026play with Elana.\u201d\n\nYou quickly gather your belongings and bid the little girl goodbye. She looks hopeful at you, but you can only imagine that her disappointment is going to be even greater when you don\u2019t return. Hopefully her mother does show up.\n\nYou leave the church and make your way to the closest sewer entrance that you know of. Fortunately even this late the militia aren\u2019t patrolling quite as much and it\u2019s easier to sneak around.\n\nYou descend into the foulness that is the sewers and begin your slog through it and eventual freedom.\n\nAlong the way you just hope you don\u2019t run into any Crimson Talons. While you doubt if they have heard about you ratting on them since the militia hasn\u2019t made their move yet, but still, you\u2019d rather not bump into them since they\u2019ve gotten more territorial lately anyway.\n\nYour thoughts also briefly go back to that little girl and how you feel sort of bad about just leaving. You should have at least been up front with her and told her you couldn\u2019t help her, rather than giving the girl a little bit longer for false hope. Then again, the last time you told the truth it didn\u2019t go so well either.\n\nYou\u2019ll just be glad to leave this damn city behind.\n\nAt last you start to see the literal light at the end of the tunnel as you approach the sewer exit leading to the outside. You have no idea how the hell the Talons slog through this day after day, though you suppose they won\u2019t be doing it for much longer.\n\nThis thought has never been truer than it is right at this moment.\n\nNo sooner have you made it half way to the exit when all of a sudden several militia men enter through it. You stop in your tracks when you see them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s warned them! Kill the bastard!\u201d one of them shouts.\n\nYou immediately turn and run. Several shots ring out along with shouting. You catch a bullet in the arm, but manage to keep going. It doesn\u2019t matter though since the militia already has men coming from the other tunnels as well.\n\nToday of ALL days is when they decided to storm the Crimson Talon hideout. It figures.\n\nIn fact the only place to run to is the Crimson Talon\u2019s hideout!\n\nAvoiding the militia now seemingly coming from every fucking tunnel, you immediately run to the hideout and start banging on the door to be let in. Even now, the irony that you\u2019re begging for the Talons to help you after you ratted on them in the first place isn\u2019t lost on you.\n\n\u201cOpen the fucking door! It\u2019s a raid!\u201d you start shouting.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any answer other than a couple of \u201cwhat?\u201d or \u201cWho\u2019s banging on the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on open the fuck up, it\u2019s\u2026ugggh! SHIT!\u201d you shout and get shot in the back. This time the wound is fatal.\n\nYou collapse at the door, which still stays firmly shut until the militia comes stomping over your body to batter it down.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Help the little girl", "result": "This really goes against everything you tend to believe in, but maybe due to a combination of several bad things you\u2019ve experienced lately, you\u2019re still hoping that MAYBE somehow doing something half way \u201cdecent\u201d that the gods or fate or whatever will reward you in some way. (Even though you don\u2019t really believe in a lot of that anyway)\n\nFirst thing you do is calm the little girl down and ask her name since this will be a whole lot easier if you know what to call her.\n\n\u201cMara.\u201d She says.\n\u201cOkay, first question. Do you know where you mom might have went or where she goes to look for work?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, mostly the taverns?\u201d the little girl asks.\n\u201c\u2026that really narrows it down\u2026(sigh) alright, I guess I can just try the closest ones in the area. I\u2019ll also need a physical description of her.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s real pretty. She has a flower name too, Violet. Her hair is black like mine and she\u2026um\u2026her chest is sort of large.\u201d\n\nWell you weren\u2019t expecting her to give that description of her mom, but you suppose it does help narrow things down a bit more.\n\n\u201cOkay, that helps a little\u2026hey wait a minute. Did you ask Virgil to help?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe friendly old priest that smells funny? Yeah, I went to his room, but he wouldn\u2019t move no matter how much I pushed him. He just kept snoring.\u201d Mara replies.\n\u201cWell this is important, and I\u2019ll go wake him up. He\u2019s supposed to be doing good deeds anyway. In the meantime you just stay here and Elana will keep you company.\u201d\n\u201cWill you come back with her?\u201d\n\u201cI promise that I\u2019ll come back.\u201d Is all you can say to her before you bid her goodbye.\n\nOf course before you leave, you head to where Virgil sleeps in this church. Sure enough he\u2019s snoring soundly. Not excessively loud, but he\u2019s definitely flat out. You don\u2019t bother with the pushing or yelling to wake him up; you just drag him out of bed by his crusty feet.\n\nHe wakes up just before he hits the floor.\n\n\u201cHey what the\u2026OW! Shit! You?! What the fuck are you dragging me out of bed for?!\u201d Virgil exclaims.\n\nYou actually sort of smile since that\u2019s more along the line of the old Virgil that you were familiar with.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be cutting down on the vulgarities now that you\u2019re all holy again? You\u2019ve woke me up plenty of times in the past banging on my door, so consider this payback. Besides, a little girl needs help and you\u2019re supposed to be doing this sort of shit anyway.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLittle girl? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nYou explain the situation to Virgil, who slowly starts becoming more alert. As you explain, he seems to remember Violet quite well. (Or her tits at least)\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I know who you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not sure what to say though. Violet is a prostitute or at least she was trying to get out of that life for the sake of her daughter as far as I know. I mean I know she was trying to get a job as a waitress with little success, but if she\u2019s disappeared during the night, she might have sadly gone back to her old ways and strayed from Joachim\u2019s path.\u201d Virgil remarks.\n\nRaven haired beauty with big tits and worked as a whore, now you\u2019re wondering how the hell you never noticed her before.\n\n\u201cWell let\u2019s try the taverns first I guess.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy am I going with you?\u201d Virgil asks.\n\u201cBecause isn\u2019t it your damn job to help the downtrodden and innocent? Besides, you being an ex-drunk, I figure that you know where ALL the closest taverns are. Also the militia is on my ass constantly, and if they catch me walking around at night, they\u2019ll probably just beat my head in and throw me in jail. I figure if I\u2019m walking around with a priest I shouldn\u2019t get harassed as much. Not like you have anything better to do anyway.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah, but\u2026you\u2019re talking about going to several taverns\u2026I\u2019m just not sure I should be around that much temptation.\u201d\n\u201cOh for\u2026just come on! If you start getting thirsty, I\u2019ll slap you in the back of the head to remind you of Joachim\u2019s light or something.\u201d\n\nVirgil reluctantly agrees to help, and soon the pair of you are off to go tavern hopping, but not in the good way.\n\nYou go to several taverns and while a couple people say they remember seeing her or even interacting with her, they tell you they haven\u2019t seen her today. Virgil meanwhile looks longingly at every mug, glass and bottle containing alcohol. It isn\u2019t excessively hard to pull him away, but it\u2019s obviously a struggle.\n\n\u201cI beseech you, no more taverns! The temptation is getting to me and it\u2019s taking all my faith in Joachim to give me strength to resist!\u201d Virgil begs.\n\u201cOkay, okay\u2026(sigh) might as well give up anyway. We\u2019ve covered a lot more ground than I thought we were and still haven\u2019t found shit. I guess we can start trying to brothels.\u201d You say.\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Are the whores going to be too much temptation too? I thought your weakness was the booze, not the women.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just I doubt very seriously that she\u2019s working in one of the Klyton brothels. At least none of the legal ones. If she was back to whoring, she\u2019d be doing it illegally and who knows where.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Mara said her mom was pretty and you even seemed to confirm that. Wouldn\u2019t she be good enough of one of those places? She a Yellow Devil addict or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing like that. In fact she used to work at Madam Moonlight\u2019s place, but she did something that severely pissed off Moonlight. I dunno what, but it was bad enough to get her fired and Moonlight apparently pulled strings at every other sanctioned brothel to not hire her.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I guess that makes sense, I\u2019ve seen Moonlight get pissed at unruly customers and makes them sorry they got out of line. Guess the same goes for her employees. Still surprised I\u2019ve never bumped into this woman before. Well I\u2019m out of ideas, I mean we can\u2019t realistically go to every inn or back alley, to look for her.\u201d\n\u201cI think the only thing that can be done is to go back. Sometimes we must just place faith in Joachim that he will influence events to a positive end. I\u2019m sure the girl\u2019s mother will come back, she may already be back for all we know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah maybe\u2026\u201d\n\nYou suddenly remember something terrible.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Virgil asks.\n\u201cIn all the rush to help the girl, I left all my shit at the church and I didn\u2019t even bother to hide it before I left! My savings!\u201d\n\u201cI doubt very seriously that anyone is going to ransack your belongings and steal what you have. All of those folks are Joachim fearing and righteous.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Then what am I doing there then?\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026well on the other hand it would be quite amusing if Joachim balanced things by taking away your wealth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell? Why are you condoning theft just because it\u2019s me?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not, but I\u2019m just saying there would be a kind of justice if it did occur, considering your own profession\u2026speaking of which\u2026Brother Thadius has expressed concerns about you continuing to sleep in the church. I\u2019ve tried to assure him that you\u2019re looking for real work, but I think we both know that isn\u2019t true and I hate lying to the man. I\u2019m already under scrutiny for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t discuss this right now, I gotta go!\u201d\n\nYou run off to leave Virgil behind and race back to the church.\n\nUnfortunately along the way you nearly bump straight into two militiamen who happen to be patrolling. They see you running and jump to their own conclusions.\n\n\u201cHALT!\u201d one of them shouts.\n\nYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong and you don\u2019t even have anything stolen on you since you left all your stuff at the church. Legally they can\u2019t really do anything to you\u2026however that\u2019s never stopped the militia from severely fucking with you before.", "action_results": [{"action": "Halt", "result": "They\u2019ve already seen your face and probably already know who you are, so running is just going to get you into more trouble. Might as well deal with this head on.\n\nThe militia approaches and you make no sudden moves.\n\n\u201cThought it was you. So where the hell are you in such a hurry in the middle of the night? Up to your usual thievery no doubt.\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to church.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery funny asshole.\u201d He replies pushing you.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious! If you\u2019re aware of who I am, then you also know I\u2019ve been living in a Church of Joachim for days now. I\u2019m not lying.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re not exactly telling the truth either\u2026seems very fishy that you\u2019re lurking around.\u201d\n\nSuddenly another one of their number runs up to them.\n\n\u201cHey! What the hell are you two doing? You\u2019re supposed to be down in the sewers helping with taking out those Talon bastards. The captain\u2019s been looking all over for you and he\u2019s pissed!\u201d he remarks.\n\u201cWhat? We got assigned street patrol duty tonight!\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve got new orders then, come on let\u2019s go. Who\u2019s this one?\u201d\n\u201cThis is the sneak thief who ratted on the Talons in the first place to save his own hide. Claims he doesn\u2019t have anything stolen on him, but I KNOW he\u2019s been up to something!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just quickly throw him in a cell because we need to get into the sewers before the shit goes down. He can be dealt with later.\u201d\n\nJust as they\u2019re about to grab you, another figure arrives. One you\u2019d never be so happy to see.\n\n\u201cHey! Ask this guy! He\u2019s a Joachim priest and I\u2019ve been walking around all damn night with him searching for a missing woman!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cIs this true?\u201d one of the men asks.\n\u201cYes, it is true. A little girl asked us to seek out her mother. In fact she specifically asked THIS man first! He has done nothing wrong and I would urge that you leave him be lest you anger Joachim for attempting to impede good works.\u201d Virgil says.\n\nOne of the guards must be a bit religious since he takes Virgil\u2019s warning a little more to heart than the rest of his fellows.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll let you go this time, but for your sake you better hope that Captain Branik finds out that all your information was good, because if not, you\u2019re gonna wish for a quick execution instead of what we will have planned for you.\u201d\n\nAs the militia leaves, you think to yourself that it\u2019s probably good that you didn\u2019t try to escape through the sewers and the abandoned tunnel outside the city tonight. You might have gotten caught in the raid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally just tell anyone this, but thanks Virgil.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m just surprised they still let you go and listened to me at all. If I were a gambling man, I\u2019d wager half of the militia have done worse things than you ever have. Hopefully as Joachim\u2019s teachings spread, so will his influence though and perhaps one day Klyton\u2019s militia won\u2019t just consist mainly of thugs with city sanctioned authority.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cI doubt it. People are just rotten by nature. The only time most do good deeds is when they have no other choice.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, and I don\u2019t even think YOU really believe that either. If that really were the case, you wouldn\u2019t be trying to help a little girl find her mother tonight. I mean what\u2019s really in it for you? Nothing. You\u2019re not getting paid for it, you\u2019re just doing it because you felt sorry for an innocent and it was the right thing to do. You\u2019re better than you think you are, we all are. Joachim always tries to make us see that, even if you don\u2019t notice that he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nRather thoughtful comments by Virgil even if you don\u2019t totally see things his way on the whole religious thing. Still, he might have a bit of a point.\n\nThe pair of you returns to the church where upon you immediately go see if any of your stuff is gone. Instead what you find is Mara sleeping near your belongings with Elana curled up next to her. Doesn\u2019t look like anything has been disturbed other than Mara using your pack as a pillow of sorts.\n\n\u201cSee? All your stuff was fine. It was being guarded by a little girl and her pet.\u201d Virgil remarks.\n\u201cNo sign of the girl\u2019s mother though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I admit, I\u2019m a bit worried about that. Mara is going to be upset, but I\u2019m still hoping that maybe she\u2019ll show up soon. Maybe in the morning?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but it\u2019ll be morning in a few hours and I don\u2019t quite have the faith you have Virgil.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get there eventually. I suppose I better reclaim some sleep before Brother Thadius shows up here in the morning to give me his plans for the day\u2019s events.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he sleep here too?\u201d\n\u201cHim? No, he lives in a proper house. Pretty nice one around the government district.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, guess all the donations to Joachim are blessing Thadius pretty well. In any case, I\u2019m going to try to get some sleep as well and for what comes next, I guess I\u2019ll figure that out when I wake up.\u201d\n\nYou and Virgil part and since Mara has taken your sleeping spot, you sleep on the mattress that presumably was where her and her mother slept. It\u2019s a lot more comfortable than sleeping on the floor for a change.\n\nLater\u2026\n\nA little hand reaches out to you; this time you only gently grab it.\n\nYou actually were awake long before she reached for you since you heard her placing all your belongings on the mattress. Not to mention Elana is currently scurrying on the mattress and sniffing about.\n\n\u201cHello Mara.\u201d You say fully waking up and let go of her wrist.\n\nAs you slowly sit up from your slumber, and look through your belongings that Mara has brought to you. Everything is there and you\u2019re finally relieved to know for certain.\n\nMara watches you with a mixture of concern and sadness. She looks like she might have been crying earlier.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would, but I couldn\u2019t be sure if anyone else didn\u2019t. Anyway thanks for bringing me my stuff and guarding it yesterday.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t find my mom did you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, unfortunately I didn\u2019t, but Virgil said it\u2019s still possible that she\u2019ll show up this morning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cIt is? Oh.\u201d\n\nMara looks down wiping her eyes. This is awkward for you and if she starts crying in front of you, it isn\u2019t like you know what to say. You ask Virgil for help, but he\u2019s likely to just spout a bunch of shit about Joachim.\n\n\u201cShe promised she wouldn\u2019t\u2026(sniffle)\u2026not anymore. Not after last time.\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cLast time?\u201d you ask.\n\nMara tells you about how some man roughed up her mom once and nearly killed her in the process a few months ago. She mentions that it sometimes happened before that too, but that was the worst time. A lot of coin went to the apothecary and the clinic and they eventually wound up here while Violet was looking for steady work that didn\u2019t require sex.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious now that Mara isn\u2019t exactly a na\u00efve child and she\u2019s well aware of the grim realities of this shitty world\u2026still though\u2026she\u2019s a nine year old girl that misses her mom.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably dead.\u201d She says, trying not to cry.\n\nYou still can\u2019t think of anything that\u2019s going to make her feel any better. You were planning on leaving this city, but\u2026\n\n\u201cHey Mara, why don\u2019t we wait for your mom a little longer okay? I mean let\u2019s not jump to conclusions, maybe she got some job that wanted her to start right away and it was so tiring that she fell asleep somewhere else.\u201d\n\nMara doesn\u2019t look convinced, but this sliver of hope wrapped in a boldfaced lie seems to at least cause her to agree.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cSure, until your mom gets back. Now let\u2019s go get something real to eat. No more of this slop that they serve here.\u201d You say.\n\nMara seems to cheer up slightly during her time with you. She mentions her mother a few times, but in happy reflections on better times she had with her.\n\nYou didn\u2019t think you would, but you sort of don\u2019t mind your time spent with Mara either.\n\nYou spend the rest of the day with Mara and the next few days after that. By the end of the week, she hasn\u2019t even mentioned her mother anymore and is more interested in you. Again, not exactly being na\u00efve (and probably overhearing Virgil\u2019s conversations with you at times) she knows that you\u2019re not exactly a \u201cworking\u201d man.\n\n\u201cDo\u2026you kill people?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cIs that what you think I do?\u201d you ask back.\n\u201cI dunno. Virgil says that you\u2019re a good man who just does bad things sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Said that did he? No, I don\u2019t kill people\u2026well not usually anyway. I\u2019m more into acquisitions.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI find stuff that I need.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026you\u2019re a thief.\u201d\n\u201cWell yes, it\u2019s not very impressive when you say it like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just I sort of wished you did kill people.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause then you could track down who killed my mother and kill them.\u201d\n\nMara at this point walks away from you, leaving you a little speechless. It\u2019s at this moment that Virgil comes over to you.\n\n\u201cI see you\u2019re still spending time with Mara. I knew you were a good man. I think it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve been trying to be there for the child.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cOf course seeing that her mother is most likely gone, the only thing to do now is to take her to the orphanage.\u201d\n\u201cOrphanage?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah. I mean the child can\u2019t stay here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would it hurt if she did stay here?\u201d\n\u201cThis place shelters the poor and families down on their luck for short periods of time, but unattended children should be in an orphanage and I know you can\u2019t look after her.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, who says I can\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I know maybe you\u2019ve gotten a little attached to Mara, but really this is a matter for a place that\u2019s capable of looking after a little girl.\u201d\n\u201cVirgil, I\u2019ve passed by those orphanages and half of them are completely neglected ragamuffins and the other half get beaten all the time and are most likely going to become vicious scoundrels. After all your bitching at me about being a thief, you REALLY think that\u2019s the best place to put her?\u201d\n\u201cThose places aren\u2019t as bad as you say! I\u2019ll have you know, I grew up in one of those places!\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s supposed to convince me that it\u2019s a good place to send her?\u201d\n\u201cOh and because you had both parents, you\u2019re such a good example that it isn\u2019t? I mean I\u2019m trying not to judge, but your parents obviously failed in their duties.\u201d\n\nAnd you\u2019re done.\n\n\u201cFuck you Virgil. Just fuck you, and your Joachim preaching bullshit. My parents were fucking great.\u201d You say and gather up your belongings (And Elana) before walking off. Virgil starts to follow you trying to apologize until he realizes what you\u2019re about to do.\n\nYou find Mara who is sitting quietly against a wall, looking at the floor.\n\n\u201cCome on Mara, we\u2019re leaving. We\u2019re done here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat? Where are we going?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cDunno yet, but we\u2019re going together.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just take this child!\u201d Virgil exclaims.\n\u201cWhy not? She\u2019s an orphan right? I\u2019m adopting her. Cuts out the need for her to even go into an orphanage.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026your emotions are letting you cloud your judgment! How are YOU going to take care of this child? Please, we must put this in the hands of Joachim and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMara? Do you want to come with me or go to an orphanage? If you don\u2019t want to come with me, just say so. I won\u2019t be mad.\u201d You say.\n\nMara is silent for a half second before: \u201cI want to come with you.\u201d\n\nYou turn to Virgil and raise your hands.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s your answer.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s going to pick you, but that\u2019s not a realistic choice!\u201d Virgil exclaims.\n\u201cHow do you know that this isn\u2019t Joachim\u2019s will? You don\u2019t and neither do I. Only Joachim knows. Praise be to him or whatever it is you say.\u201d You remark and push Virgil out of the way.\n\nYou ignore Virgil\u2019s protests as you leave and make your way to the carriage station. You know you\u2019re allowed out of the city now given all the Crimson Talons are dead and the restriction for you to leave has been lifted.\n\nYou suppose you\u2019ll head to Hessla first and from there you\u2019ll figure out a more long-term plan. You just need to get out of this city, especially before you\u2019re wanted for kidnapping along with anything else the militia decides you\u2019re guilty of. You start to think about your situation and realize it\u2019s really fucking crazy. You\u2019re now a fugitive from TWO places and have little girl to look after. (And an oversized rat, but Elana is pretty self-sufficient)\n\nStill, you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019re doing the right thing and you don\u2019t even know why. What you do know is you\u2019re going to have to step things up because it\u2019s not just you anymore.\n\n\u201cHey Mara.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Mara answers as she continues to look out of one of the windows, fascinated by it all.\n\u201cCome over here for a moment.\u201d You say pulling out your small locked container containing what\u2019s left of your savings.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cSomething I hope we can both fill up eventually. For now though, it\u2019s practice.\u201d\n\nYou pull out a lock pick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you something useful.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes\u2026", "result": "Chapter 3B1: The More They Get Complicated\n\n\nYear 30\n\nA hand reaches for the pouch on your side; you grab it and open your eyes.\n\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d Mara exclaims.\n\u201cI keep telling you, you\u2019re not quiet enough and you make more noise than a clumsy orc. I honestly don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t get caught more often by your marks.\u201d You say sitting up.\n\u201cWell if I do, that\u2019s only because I\u2019m doing it like how you taught me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you really think that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been teaching you, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention and we need to spend even more time training. What time is it?\u201d\n\u201cAfternoon. You slept through the morning as usual.\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right. So\u2026early bird, what have you been up to this morning?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much really. Just wandering around the city and doing stuff.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, wouldn\u2019t be with that little gang of hoodlums you hang out with sometimes would it?\u201d\n\nMara does answer immediately.\n\n\u201cFigured.\u201d You say shaking your head.\n\u201cWhy are you so against me having friends?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I just think those idiots are a bad influence.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? YOU think other people are a bad influence on me?\u201d\n\u201cOh trust me, the irony isn\u2019t lost on me, however I would propose that I am at least a bad influence in an efficient way. You keep hanging out with that group of losers and well\u2026you remember what happened to the Crimson Talons?\u201d\n\nMara rolls her eyes.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Klyton, and my friends aren\u2019t the Crimson Talons!\u201d she exclaims.\n\u201cNo they aren\u2019t. The Talons were more organized and they STILL got completely wiped out due to being reckless. And while maybe the Jicol Watch isn\u2019t as overzealous as the Klyton Militia, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before your friends get into a whole mess of trouble that they\u2019re going to bring down on their own heads because they think punching old ladies in the street and grabbing their coin pouches to be the height of thievery.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOnly a couple of them do that! And Marco has been telling them not to do it anymore. He said as the Black Hooks, they should be\u2026\u201d\n\nYou start chuckling.\n\n\u201cBlack Hooks? They gave themselves a gang name? Oh that\u2019s precious. Truly a name that will stir fear into everyone. And you\u2019re telling me Marco is the leader? The gang already sucks.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026why\u2026why are you being such an asshole?! Marco\u2019s a great guy and he\u2019s trying to put it all together with my help! He\u2019s a real thief! Just like me and you!\u201d\n\u201cPFFT!\u201d you say with a mixture of contempt and genuine amusement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met Marco when you first introduced me to all these idiots last year and that boy is NOTHING like me. He wasn\u2019t even me at that age. And as for him being like you, I like to think I\u2019m a way better teacher than that despite your previous criticisms.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re just an cranky old man who doesn\u2019t want me associating with anyone except you!\u201d\n\u201cOkay first of all, I\u2019m only fucking thirty. Second of all I do know what the hell I\u2019m talking about. I understand your need for friends your own age, but I\u2019m telling you this is the fucking wrong crowd. I\u2019ve seen some of these dumb asses in action when I\u2019m going about my own business and they\u2019re all going to wind up in a bad end.\u201d\n\nAt this point you stand up and continue your rant.\n\n\u201cAnd as for Marco, of course he wants your help, because out of ALL of them, you\u2019re the only real thief there and he\u2019s hoping that at least SOME of that shit that I\u2019ve taught you will rub off on him. Well that and the fact he also wants you around to get in your pants.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cY\u2019know, sometimes I wonder if that\u2019s why you want me around.\u201d Mara retorts.\n\nYou stop for a split second at this outrageous accusation\n\n\u201cWow. You\u2019re REALLY going to go there? Y\u2019know, if you really think that, then just fucking go. Go off with your little friends. Well? Go! GET THE FUCK OUT!\u201d you shout.\n\nMara jumps back a bit by your yelling and then without another word, she leaves slamming the door behind you. You slump back down on the bed already feeling drained even though you just woke up.\n\nThings were getting a bit tenser with Mara for a couple years now. You chalked it up to her being a teenager, but this latest argument has made you start to wonder if it\u2019s worse than just the need to rebel against you.\n\nAs you try to calm yourself down, Elana jumps up on the bed and very slowly walks over to you. You give her a pet and she curls up to sleep. She does that a lot more nowadays. She\u2019s so old, and right about now you\u2019re feeling the same way.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) It\u2019s really damn bad when I\u2019m already missing the old days. Just me and sis against the world. Been downhill ever since that split. Certainly hope she\u2019s doing a lot better than I am right now.\u201d\n\nYou continue to brood, thinking about what you should have done or shouldn\u2019t have done in your life. Eventually you stop since it\u2019s not doing you any good, so you go back to sleep instead.\n\nA few hours later you wake up and find that it\u2019s nighttime. Mara isn\u2019t home, but then maybe she won\u2019t ever come back. Still, you can\u2019t help but be concerned about her.\n\nYou can only hope that she knows what the hell she\u2019s doing and that you taught her well enough that she doesn\u2019t get caught or can get herself out of trouble.\n\nIn the meantime you decide to get some of your own work done and leave your humble dwellings to go accomplish just that.\n\nA few days pass and Mara still hasn\u2019t come home. However, you\u2019ve still been keeping an eye on her from afar. You mostly know where she is and all her hang outs. She spends most of her time in the city district where docks of lesser importance are located. It isn\u2019t the best area, but given that she\u2019s with her Black Hook friends, you assume that she at least has people to watch her back. (And you figure Marco is especially, but you\u2019d rather not think too much about that)\n\nAs for the Black Hooks themselves, they\u2019re still pretty low as far as Watch is concerned it seems. When the city is more concerned with keeping a strong naval force to ward off any potential pirate attacks, a group of juvenile delinquents that still haven\u2019t done much more than petty theft, assault and vandalism, just doesn\u2019t rank very high.\n\nHonestly, you\u2019re more surprised that Mara hasn\u2019t gotten bored by them all yet since you know she\u2019s a lot more talented than any of them. You know you\u2019d be bored. Then again you suppose you just weren\u2019t very social and never wanted to hang around with too many people. Just one that you could trust.\n\nWeeks pass and while you continue to keep an eye on her, sometimes you start to wonder if maybe you should let go. Of course if you did let go, you\u2019d have to leave the city altogether, because you just couldn\u2019t stick around and NOT look out for her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Jicol", "result": "Mara is still young, but in this sort of world that\u2019s really no measure of being sheltered from the harsh realities of the world. The girl lost her mother and was mentored by a professional thief. She\u2019s probably more ready to be on her own than most her age.\n\nYou need to move on though. It\u2019s apparent that your good intensions have been less than successful. That\u2019s fine though, because you\u2019ve learned that more than ever that you should only worry about yourself.\n\nYou pack up all your stuff and get ready to go. You\u2019re sure you can book passage aboard some ship heading to Hessla. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll go elsewhere.\n\nYou get half way to the transport docks and stop. You can\u2019t leave like this. As much as it would be easier to do so, you can\u2019t. You have to apologize to Mara before leaving.\n\nShe might very well tell you to go to hell. In fact if she\u2019s around her friends, she\u2019s very likely to do that, but still you have to try.\n\nYou head down to where the Black Hooks usually hang out. These young idiots like to pretend they\u2019re all going to be pirates one day. You can only imagine how they\u2019d really fare if they were in a pirate-dominated town like Hessla instead of this well fortified and more lawful city.\n\nEventually you arrive at the small beach area where there you see the \u201cBlack Hooks\u201d all lingering under and around a boardwalk. Up to their usual bragging and bravado of course.\n\n\u201cAnd so I said to that bitch, you\u2019re either giving me your necklace, or I\u2019m gonna take it after I cut off your fucking head! She was pissing her knickers after that hahahaha!\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this asshole coming up?\u201d asks one of them.\n\u201cHey dumb fuck, don\u2019t you know this is Black Hook territory?\u201d one of them shouts.\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d you hear a quieter voice say and you already pinpoint that it\u2019s Mara trying to unsuccessfully hide behind a couple of her friends.\n\n\u201cMara, I know you\u2019re over there, come on out, I want to talk to you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey old man, Mara ain\u2019t got shit to say to you.

Now you better get outta here before we\u2026\u201d Marco says stepping forward before you grab him by the collar and throw him down face down in the sand as hard as you can.\n\nMarco spends the rest of his time spitting out sand and rubbing his eyes, while his gang does nothing except look at you.\n\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been telling these dickheads? Do you REALLY hate me that much that you\u2019re going to make up stories like that about me? You know, I came to apologize and say goodbye, but if this is what you want, then fuck it. Have a nice life.\u201d You say and turn around to leave.\n\nYou get a couple steps, before Mara calls out to you.\n\n\u201cI never said he molested me! Why the hell did you say that?!\u201d she says to Marco and then calls out to you \u201cWait! Hold on!\u201d\n\u201cMara, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d you hear Marco say as you turn around.\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna talk to him, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\u201cNo! He\u2019s just gonna trick you into going back to him!\u201d\n\u201cMarco, it\u2019ll be fine, let go of me!\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m the one who loves you!\u201d\n\n\u201cMarco, you better let her go.\u201d You say as you approach.\n\nHe isn\u2019t listening though and once again you grab him, however this time he manages to pull out a flintlock. You would have easily took it away from him had some of his boys not grown a pair and stabbed you in the side and back.\n\nYou fall to the sand making it red with your blood. Mara is now screaming at Marco to not shoot you, but he\u2019s too committed to care. He\u2019s been waiting a long time to do this to someone and it\u2019s just a bonus that it\u2019s you.\n\nYou take a shot directly to the chest and the life is already leaving your body. Marco\u2019s gang scatters at this point and Marco himself tries to drag Mara with him, but she manages to pull away until he just swears and values running from the scene of the crime more than her.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty way to have it all end like this by some snot nosed kid and in front of another who apparently did care about you in the end as she kneels down beside you crying as you die.\n\nYou comfort yourself in your last moments with the fact that you weren\u2019t completely alone.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay", "result": "No, you\u2019re not going anywhere.

Besides this unpleasantness with Mara, your life here in Jicol hasn\u2019t been that bad. Certainly better than it was in Klyton or your very brief stay in Hessla.\n\nStill, you\u2019re starting to wonder if you should try your hand at something new. Not that you really believe that you\u2019re starting to get too old for this, but it would be nice to have an income that\u2019s steadier.\n\nYou know that they have Qweepa fights here, but you\u2019re a little too attached to Elana to subject her to that. Besides she\u2019s too old and you don\u2019t think that after having one as a pet that you\u2019d want to willingly risk their little ugly rodent lives even if it is for coin.\n\nYou think for a moment on the various activities you could be doing and then realize you could be a fence. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have skill in selling stolen items already. You had to do it when the Crimson Talons stopped fencing for you; you still do it now when you\u2019re selling to the less honest merchants here.\n\nWhat you need to try to do though is make yourself known to other thieves who are unwilling to or don\u2019t know how to wheel and deal with the merchants. Not that you\u2019ve ever particularly hung out within the \u201ccriminal circle\u201d in the city, but you are aware of some of them. You figure you can work your way up to bigger clients in time.\n\nYou get yourself set up and within a month you get a few of the lesser pickpockets to sell you\u2019re a few of the trinkets they\u2019ve stolen. You in return sell those to whoever is willing to buy. Be it an average citizen on the street that needed for a gift for his girlfriend or a less than honest merchant.\n\nAs you become more engrossed in this work that you spend less time watching out for Mara, however she\u2019s always in the back your mind and you at least try to keep an ear out for possible information. She still hasn\u2019t returned of course and that of course still makes you feel a bit down.\n\nA month later your mood doesn\u2019t change much when Elana dies peacefully in her sleep. You bury the little rodent, thanking her for being the link that allowed you meet Mara in the first place.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s due to being a bit lonely and away from the mainland that you start to think about your real family again. You wonder how they\u2019re all doing. Is your sister still having her adventures on the road? Are your mom and dad okay? In fact, you get a little home sick and do something out of character, you write a letter to your family explaining that you\u2019re doing well. You don\u2019t go into great detail of course, you just keep it light and add an apology at the end. You send it by the courier service here, but who knows if it will actually get to them and you have no expectations that you\u2019ll hear anything back.\n\nA few more months pass and you\u2019re approached by a couple of young teenagers. You immediately notice that they both have tattoos of black hooks on their arms.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026um\u2026are you the guy?\u201d one asks.\n\u201cAm I the guy what?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cY\u2019know, the guy that buys shit.\u201d\n\nYou nearly chuckle. Of all the groups that would come to you\u2026then again you suppose it isn\u2019t too surprising, what with the Black Hooks being \u201con the rise\u201d and all. And what the hell, business is business.\n\n\u201cIf I was, and I\u2019m not saying that I am, do you have something in particular?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah! We just ripped this off from that Artifacts of the Ancients place! LOOK!\u201d one of the teenagers remarks and trusts some sort of vase at you.\n\u201cAre you fucking stupid showing that thing out here in the open? Put that damn thing away and follow me to some place less likely to get us all fucking pinched!\u201d\n\nAfter doing your business with the Black Hooks, you remind them that you also sell items too and if they need anything in particular you could try to acquire it for them.\n\n\u201cYou have any Green Lotus?\u201d one of them asks.\n\u201cNot really a drug dealer guys, you\u2019d have better luck at Desolation Alley if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. However I can probably find something stronger in a few weeks if you\u2019re interested.\u201d You say.\n\u201cStronger? Fuck yeah! Oh wait, it\u2019s not Yellow Devil is it? Because I heard that shit literally melts your brains and body if you use it.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, not that. What I\u2019m talking about is actually legal, but not just available to most of the public. Physicians use it mostly for surgeries, it\u2019s called Numb. Used to be able to get a lot of the stuff back in Klyton thanks to their medical school. Not as easy to get here, but I have my ways. Now normally this would cost you more than a bit of coin, but when I get it I\u2019ll give you a discount, but I do want to some information.\n\u201cWhat sort of information?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know a girl named Mara? She\u2019s in your gang.\u201d\n\u201cWe just joined, so we don\u2019t know everyone yet.\u201d One of them remarks.\n\u201cWait, Mara? She\u2019s got black hair and was teaching those other guys how to pick a lock a few days ago. She\u2019s Marco\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d The other says.\n\u201cOhhhhh, yeah her. She\u2019s fucking pretty, I\u2019d so get her on all fours and fuck the hell out of her.\u201d\n\u201cHey! That\u2019s Marco\u2019s girl!\u201d\n\u201cSo? He\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I am. I\u2019ve looked after that girl for the past five years you asshole.\u201d You say.\n\nThe teen suddenly shuts up.\n\n\u201cUm, he was just joking\u2026\u201d his friend says.\n\u201cHm, I\u2019m sure. Look never mind all that. I just want you two to give me a report on her, and no, I\u2019m not asking you to snitch any of those precious Black Hook plans or secrets, of yours.\u201d\n\u201cNothing else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just want you to tell me what she\u2019s up to and if she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s okay I guess, but this Numb shit better be worth it!\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be worth it. Trust me.\u201d\n\nAnd with that last bit of assurance, the two teens leave your presence. You hope those two idiots don\u2019t make themselves too obvious in performing your task. You\u2019d hate for them to get caught and then Mara come down just to bitch at you about it.\n\nYou make a note that you need to go do a proper burglary of that Numb addict doctor that lives over across town. You\u2019re guessing that he must get it through a very well protected shipment from the mainland. Probably even from Klyton. You also know damn well that the last time you cased his place that you found way more than he would ever need for a private practice of his that small.\n\nIn the meantime, you have to go see a woman you know who is a sucker for fancy looking vases.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\n\u201cI just paid you! Dolan exclaims.\n\u201cYeah and you know the damn rules Dolan, you can get Numb AFTER you give me the information as well!\u201d you say.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know any more! I swear! I\u2019m got my ass chewed out by Marco already for asking too many questions! Hasn\u2019t all the other information I\u2019ve given you in the past been good?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, fine. But I\u2019d advise you to start going easy on this stuff. It\u2019s not as simple to acquire anymore. So unless you want to go risk getting that inferior Green Lotus shit that got your buddy killed due to getting a bad batch, I suggest you not even come back unless you got a lot of coin or some information I can actually use. Now you better get out of here before some other Black Hooks come in to sell something and overhear that you\u2019re spying on all of them.\u201d\n\nDolan meekly takes his small container of Numb and scampers away like the low life he is. The boy had no idea that it was going to lead up to this, though you planned that it would. A somewhat reliable mole in the Black Hooks just so you can keep an ear out on what they\u2019re doing, though it\u2019s still more to keep a check on Mara who apparently is doing well in her position with Black Hooks though that doesn\u2019t surprise you for several reasons.\n\nIn some ways you\u2019re actually proud of her, but as always there is still concern. Especially with what you\u2019ve been hearing lately and the Jicol Watch is the least of potential problems. A few members of the infamous Ebony Claw Syndicate have been seen in the city.\n\nYou\u2019ve already heard the many tales of the Ebony Claw Syndicate. They\u2019re a huge organization with a shitload of resources behind them and when they start showing up regularly in a city that usually means it\u2019s currently in their sights for expansion. And if they do expand, there isn\u2019t much that is going to stop them, as most of the criminal here are unorganized. Anyone who they don\u2019t bother to incorporate into their organization is going to just get eliminated.\n\nThis development has got you slightly more concerned for Mara since as a member of the only potential \u201corganized resistance\u201d to an ECS take over the Black Hooks could very be on the list for elimination.\n\nYou aren\u2019t really sure what you can do though. You haven\u2019t spoken to Mara since she left two years ago and she\u2019s made no effort to contact you.\n\nOf course you haven\u2019t really made the effort to speak with her either and it\u2019s not like you couldn\u2019t meet her alone given the eye you keep on her with your drug addled spy. You suppose you haven\u2019t since you aren\u2019t sure if she\u2019d want to see you.\n\nFor a couple days you seriously mull over the idea of going to see her or not and that\u2019s when you get a visit from members of the ECS.\n\n\u201cFigured it wouldn\u2019t be long before you guys showed up.\u201d You say when they come through the door.\n\nThe pair of them are about the sort you\u2019d expect from the ECS, a couple of intimidating muscular guys with tattoos. They don\u2019t answer you right away and just briefly look around before addressing you.\n\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re the fence of this city?\u201d one of them asks.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m hardly the only one.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re probably the best one.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Glad to hear my reputation is in good standing with the underworld I suppose. Never can quite tell in this line of work as I\u2019m sure you well know.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed with the Jicol underworld if you\u2019re considered the best, but looks can be deceiving I suppose especially since you seem to have even eluded being under suspicion by the Jicol Watch here. It at least shows you know how to keep a low profile, which displays signs of professionalism. In any case my name is Nathan and since you already seemed to know we were going to show up I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume you know why we\u2019re here.\u201d Nathan says.\n\u201cWell I can take a guess, but for all I know you might be here to kill me.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOh we don\u2019t have nearly enough information about this city and it\u2019s major players to start killing anyone yet. However it doesn\u2019t seem like there are any major players unless we count the actual government\u2026or have we missed someone?\u201d\n\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, am I? Surely an important man as you knows things. Of course if you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t know anything, maybe we should talk to someone else\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHold on. I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t know anything. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re fairly correct about the situation in Jicol. The underworld element here has no real uniting entity and I don\u2019t have much to add.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. So what about this other group I\u2019ve heard about in passing, the Black Hookers or something?\u201d\n\u201cUm, the Black Hooks. Yes, mostly an unruly gang of amateur teenagers who think they\u2019re tough. Not really that important.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Though from what I hear their numbers are sizable and the youth are easily molded if given the proper motivation and training.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t respond to Nathan\u2019s last response. Nathan at this juncture makes a few eye and hand gestures to his less talkative comrade. Nathan\u2019s friend nods and stands by the door while Nathan addresses you again.\n\n\u201cOkay friendo, I\u2019m going to tell you this because quite frankly I don\u2019t want to be bothered running around speaking to every little two copper thug that\u2019s in this city and you seem to deal with most of them anyway. Even if you don\u2019t then you know enough of them that they\u2019ll spread the word to the rest.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that word is exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThe ECS is taking over ALL operations here. A pocket isn\u2019t going to be picked in this city without us guiding the hand and getting our cut. This might not be today, this might not be tomorrow, it might not even be next year, but we are coming and nobody here is going to stop us.\u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, let everyone know that the ECS isn\u2019t unreasonable. If they seek us out for official membership we will consider them. Even if they aren\u2019t quite up to our standards, we\u2019ll find something for them as an associate. One thing we WILL NOT tolerate however is resistance. So let everyone know, defying the Ebony Claws won\u2019t be in their best interest if they wish to continue their choice of careers in the future.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have much to add to that, save for a nod.\n\n\u201cSo I trust I can count on you for this task?\u201d Nathan asks.\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll spread the word, though I\u2019m wondering about my place in this new order you\u2019re proposing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m not worried about you. You seem intelligent enough to know to step aside when a storm is coming. For now you can continue your business as usual. We can discuss your future when things are more settled. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk again many more times soon.\u201d\n\nNathan smiles and bids you good day. As he and his friend start to walk out the door, you realize that now you really do have to speak with Mara personally.\n\nLater on in the week you go to seek her out, though you stay out of sight until you can get her alone which isn\u2019t really a long wait since you find out that she mostly works alone and at night when she\u2019s not socializing with her fellow Black Hooks.\n\nYou follow her for a while as she creeps into a couple closed businesses, and then make your presence known when she\u2019s sneaking out of a bakery of all places.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize the bakeries were doing so well.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShit! Oh damn it, there goes my evening snack!\u201d Mara exclaims when she gets startled by you and then drops the pastry she stole.\n\nMara composes herself and then looks at you. She\u2019s grown a bit. Granted you knew that and you\u2019ve seen her from afar, but this the first time in two years you\u2019ve spoke to her and seen her this close.\n\nYou sort of expect Mara to either walk away from you or get nasty, but she doesn\u2019t, instead you get:\n\n\u201cHey\u2026dad.\u201d She says.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re my daughter now?\u201d you ask\n\u201cWell what would you call us?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you made a pretty damning accusation before you left two years ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I really shouldn\u2019t have said that. Always sort of thought I should apologize to you, but\u2026I dunno\u2026guess I was just too stubborn.\u201d\n\u201cWell I could have apologized as well. I was stubborn too, though I also thought that you\u2019d just yell at me and walk away.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe in the beginning I suppose, but I haven\u2019t really been angry at you for a long time. Honestly, I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten as mad as I did, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know. You needed to have friends your own age. That\u2019s another reason why I just let you be.\u201d\n\nMara smirks a bit.\n\n\u201cBullshit. You\u2019ve still been keeping an eye on me all this time. Even when you stopped physically spying, you got those two idiots Dolan and Addison when he was still alive to spy for you.\u201d She replies.\n\u201cGuilty. So when did Dolan confess his guts to you?\u201d you ask with a bit of a smile.\n\u201cActually Dolan and Addison never told me anything directly, but they became so obvious as time wore on that I knew they weren\u2019t just being horny guys staring at me and trying to eavesdrop on me. When I found out that several of the Black Hooks would do business with you, I sort of drew my own conclusions after following them around a bit.\u201d Mara remarks.\n\u201cSo any reason why you kept it to yourself and didn\u2019t tell Marco or even confront me about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell like I said, I was too stubborn to go see you in person again, and I figured why mess up perfectly good business between you and the Black Hooks? That wouldn\u2019t benefit anyone and I didn\u2019t want to see you possibly get hurt since I know that you were just concerned about me.\u201d\n\nMara then walks forward towards and touches your hand.\n\n\u201cYou stepped up and looked after me when I was well on my way to an orphanage. At least you taught me skills to survive and were nice. Who knows what would have happened in the orphanage. I won\u2019t ever just forget that and I\u2019m sorry we parted the way we did.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, that\u2019s all in the past. Don\u2019t worry about that now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear you say that, though I feel like you didn\u2019t just come see me to reconnect again.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s trouble coming for everyone in this city and maybe the Black Hooks most of all.\u201d\n\nYou and Mara go some place more private (And less near some place she just broke into) and you explain the situation with the Ebony Claw Syndicate. While she\u2019s definitely listening to you, you don\u2019t think she quite appreciates the situation.\n\n\u201cThe Black Hooks will fight back against these Ebony Claws if they start showing up and throwing their weight around.\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s exactly what you DON\u2019T want to do with these guys. Look Mara, I\u2019ll acknowledge that the Black Hooks are more skilled than I originally gave them credit for and they\u2019ve lasted longer than I thought too. But when it comes down to it, you\u2019re all still a bunch of teenagers that don\u2019t know shit. The ECS has been around for\u2026shit I dunno even know how long. These guys aren\u2019t just a gang like your Black Hook friends or even the Crimson Talons, they\u2019re a powerful organization that rivals fucking governments at times. Jicol is a prime meat for them and they aren\u2019t going to be denied their dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying, but how do we really know all this? What I mean is, how do we know it isn\u2019t all just stories? Have you really ever had to deal with them in before? They never had a presence in Klyton, maybe their rep is exaggerated.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t argue that maybe it is to some degree, but I also don\u2019t see the need for a pointless risk. Honestly, the Black Hooks would probably be incorporated into the EBS, you\u2019d probably be fine if you complied.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but I doubt if Marco would agree to it. He\u2019s got some plans of his own and getting assimilated or pushed around by a rival group isn\u2019t part of it.\u201d\n\u201cWell you better convince him otherwise then, because it won\u2019t end well for the Black Hooks if you go to war with the Ebony Claws.\u201d\n\nMara has her own suggestion.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026can\u2019t we all just unite?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI mean don\u2019t you have connections with a lot of the other independent thieves and such? I mean surely they wouldn\u2019t want the ECS coming in, pushing them around and taking a cut of their money either.\u201d\n\u201cWell some of them wouldn\u2019t be pleased. Others I\u2019d wager would just throw their lot in with ECS thanks to their reputation alone.\u201d\n\u201cBut couldn\u2019t we convince enough of them to repel this invasion?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tall order, but\u2026I suppose it could be possible. We\u2019d have to act fast though and we\u2019d have to track down the current ECS outpost here and eliminate them all. I mean leave nobody left. With some luck MAYBE with nobody reporting back to the mainland, the ECS will just assume the worst and not bother sending anyone else. If not, well we just continue with the united front and kill the ECS as they arrive until they stop. I don\u2019t have to tell you though how dangerous that\u2019s all going to be.\u201d\n\nMara seems more receptive to that plan, though you\u2019re usually more for anything that\u2019s going to result in less risk for life and limb, but you\u2019ve also got the long term to think about which is do you really want to answer to the ECS?", "action_results": [{"action": "Comply", "result": "You\u2019ve already been given a good deal and fighting the ECS is just crazy. Hopefully you can make Mara see that.\n\n\u201cMara, we only just reunited and I don\u2019t want to lose you now. We need to not oppose the ECS.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I understand. However, I can\u2019t just abandon my friends either. I\u2019m going to try to convince them\u2026though I don\u2019t know how much success I\u2019m going to have, but I need to try.\u201d\n\nYou hug Mara and breathe a sigh of relief. It isn\u2019t the complete break from the Black Hooks that you wanted, but it\u2019s a start and she\u2019s at least listening.\n\nYou part ways with Mara and tell her to be careful. You hope that she gives up her plan before things get worse with the ECS.\n\nIn the meantime you go back to your own business and perform the task that the ECS told you to do. Many of the thieves\u2019 express a certain amount of fear and respect upon hearing the Ebony Claws are in the city. Several outright say they\u2019re leaving it now. Many others mutter a bit about the end of the independent is at hand. A rare few say they\u2019re actually going to oppose the Claws.\n\nMadness, you believe with the last group, but you\u2019re merely relaying information, not trying to change anyone\u2019s minds, other than Mara\u2019s.\n\nWeeks pass and while you see Mara every now and then still, you begin to worry because you thought she would have given up this foolishness of convincing the Black Hooks by now. She\u2019s been going for slow burn of trying to convince them, but so far she\u2019s only got a couple who simply say that while they aren\u2019t keen on fighting with the ECS, they don\u2019t really want to oppose Marco. And convincing him has been completely unsuccessful.\n\nYou really don\u2019t want to interfere since you know if you do, it\u2019s possibly just going to drive Mara back into the Black Hooks.\n\nYour concern increases when you hear that the Black Hooks killed two of ECS members and burned down a general store, which was acting as their headquarters. Already the Black Hooks are declaring victory over the ECS, which you know is not true. When you ask Dolan what the two men looked like that they killed, they don\u2019t match the description of Nathan and his friend at all.\n\nThe ECS probably has a lot more folks on here than anyone knows. The general store was probably just a business front they were getting ready to set up and their real headquarters is elsewhere. Wherever it is though, you know the Black Hooks don\u2019t have long for this world and you need to get Mara the hell out of there.\n\nAs soon as you\u2019re able, you make your way down to the popular Black Hook hangout near a small beach and under a boardwalk.\n\nYou see a lot of them drinking, laughing and generally having a good time. You don\u2019t even get the hostile territorial attitude that you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cHey it\u2019s fence man! Have a drink! We\u2019re celebrating our victory over those Ebony Claw pussies!\u201d one of them says thrusting a bottle of something at you.\n\u201cYeah! We just saved the fuckin\u2019 city! We\u2019re heroes!\u201d another says.\n\u201cOhh, who\u2019s this one? He\u2019s old\u2026but handsome, you wanna give me a spanking daddy?\u201d a mildly drunk girl says to you.\n\nYou tell them all to get off of you and ask if anyone has seen Mara. None of them have though. You don\u2019t have much luck until Marco suddenly shows up. He\u2019s certainly grown since the first time Mara brough him around two years ago, but you\u2019re hardly intimidated.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you want? This is a private celebration for Black Hooks only, not pussies who quake in fear of the ECS! The ECS that WE just destroyed!\u201d he says.\n\u201cYeah, sure you did. Look, I\u2019ll leave you assholes to your dead man\u2019s party in a moment, but I\u2019m looking for Mara, now where the hell is she?\u201d\n\u201cHey cocksucker, I dunno where you THINK you are, but this is fucking Black Hook territory and you\u2019re talking to the fucking head of it! You don\u2019t come into my fucking place and start\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Marco can even finish, you punch him in the face and trip him to the sand. You then place a knee into his chest and pull your flintlock on him. The rest of his minions don\u2019t even make a move against you. They just look on in awe. Marco on the other hand looks on in fear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this shit Marco, I wanna know where my daughter is NOW!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOkay! Just don\u2019t shoot! I dunno where she is! She kept coming around trying to convince us not to fight with the ECS, but after a really big argument a few days ago, she and a few others that agreed with her finally left for good. I think she\u2019s been hanging out with them on the other side of city! And that\u2019s all I know, I swear!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re about to ask where on the other side of the city and that\u2019s when you hear the sound of a bolt going into someone followed by their body dropping.\n\nSeveral more bolts, as well as bullets follow.\n\n\u201cOh shit! It\u2019s the ECS and there\u2019s a shitload of them!\u201d someone screams.\n\nYou look around from your position and see that there are indeed A LOT of ECS members all armed and surrounding the area. Some of the Black Hooks are trying to escape by swimming out further into the water, but thanks to most of them being drunk, they don\u2019t get very far and just become even easier targets\n\nMarco pushes you off of him in an attempt to escape, but he gets struck down by crossbow fire after only getting a few paces away from you.\n\nYou attempt to shout at the ECS explaining that you\u2019re not with the Black Hooks, but they\u2019re not in a listening mood and as far as their concerned, you were found with them, so\u2026\n\nYou die on the sand, with several bolts in your body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Resist", "result": "You got run out of your home town, you got run out of Klyton, you\u2019re sick of running even if the ECS aren\u2019t driving you out in the traditional sense. Plus you just reunited with Mara, it would probably be best if you stuck by her if you want to continue a good relationship with her.\n\n\u201cMara, maybe you\u2019re right I think we need to fight.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI agree, though I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m a little scared.\u201d Mara replies.\n\u201cWell good. You should be scared, because this is going to be dangerous. However, think of it this way. Right now we\u2019ve got a numerical advantage and the element of surprise. The guy that spoke to me, Nathan seems to labor under the impression that I\u2019m going to comply with his wishes to tell everyone to join them. Obviously I\u2019m going to do the opposite.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it will work?\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s not going to be easy. I\u2019m going to put out feelers for the ones who I know will resist first. In the meantime, I want you to go tell your boyfriend AND urge to him how serious this is. We need to all coordinate an attack plan and strike only when the time is right. If we go in half assed on this, we\u2019re all going to hang. Now are you absolutely sure he and the rest of the Black Hooks aren\u2019t going to be likely to join the ECS?\u201d\n\u201cVery sure. I certainly don\u2019t want to and Marco isn\u2019t my boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026he\u2019s not? Hm, guess my information is severely out of date and Dolan isn\u2019t as thorough as he claims.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 things change, and it hasn\u2019t been long. In fact nobody in the Black Hooks really knows yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, you okay? I mean is there something really bad that happened that you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t a bad split or anything like that. Just wasn\u2019t working out. Anyway, I think we got more important things to worry about with the Claws.\u201d\n\u201cSo we do. Okay, you know what to do and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be speaking again sometime in the near future. Oh and I suppose you can go ahead and tell Dolan that he doesn\u2019t need to worry about spying anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nBefore you part ways, you hug Mara who returns it. You tell her to be careful and that you\u2019re glad to be speaking with her again.\n\nYou get to work immediately and eventually you manage to get together a group that you\u2019re sure is going to be receptive to opposing the ECS, however a few of them have other concerns.\n\n\u201cSo who\u2019s leading this resistance? You?\u201d one of them asks.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m more of an organizer, but I suppose we can all contribute ideas.\u201d You say.\n\u201cA council? That sound like a terrible idea. Things like this a lot better with a defined leader.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cI dunno, isn\u2019t this the sort of thing we\u2019re trying to avoid? I mean we\u2019re essentially forming a gang to oppose the ECS. And say we actually succeed, then what? We just avoided getting assimilated or eliminated at the cost of being independent in the first place.\u201d yet another responds.\n\u201cAnd what about those Black Hook bastards? You said they\u2019re going to be involved? Can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d A fourth says.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you one thing right now if that little shit Marco is supposed to be in charge of this, I\u2019m out right now.\u201d A fifth says.\n\nYou can see how difficult is going to be already.\n\n\u201cOkay, people, people! I understand all these concerns, but let me address some right now! First, this isn\u2019t going to be a gang, its not even going to be a guild. This is just going to be a mutually beneficial alliance. We ALL agree to work together to oppose the ECS or any other threat to our interests. After said threat is gone, we can all go back to being little special grains of sand. As for the Black Hooks, we\u2019re going to be allying with them as well, even if they\u2019re their own separate entity. We just all need to coordinate and get as many people on board with this as possible.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCan I just say something?\u201d an older man you only know as \u201cSneaks\u201d asks.\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cI faced the ECS on a regular basis many years ago back in Holgard. I belonged to the Thieves Guild there that opposed them. We tried our best, but ultimately they wiped us out. I dare say I\u2019m one of the few that got away to my knowledge. Now I already knew they were in this city before you even called this meeting. I actually planned on catching first ship out of here just because I didn\u2019t want to go through this mess again. However, while they might be powerful the ECS tends to abandon places if it\u2019s going to cost them more effort than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nThe old thief stands up from his chair to continue his speech.\n\n\u201cSo I think you\u2019re correct in that if we do act now before they get entrenched like they did in Holgard, we might just stop them. I\u2019m going to go try to convince a few others that respect my opinion to join us in this task. I urge you all to do the same because if we just let the ECS come in here, it\u2019s going to be worse than you think if we just comply.\u201d\n\nBetween you and Sneaks\u2019 speeches the rest seem more convinced of this cause. You realize it\u2019s still going to take some hammering out all the details, but this is a good start.\n\nA bit more discussion goes on and eventually the group breaks up for the night. You tell Sneaks to stick around though since you want to speak with him a little more.\n\n\u201cHey, a lot of your words really helped I think. Pretty sure some of them would have left otherwise.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell you put all this together so I think you\u2019re more responsible than anyone else for this resistance.\u201d Sneaks replies.\n\u201cFunny enough I was seriously considering in just complying when the ECS first approached me, it was someone else who felt fighting was a more worthy pursuit. Glad she did now.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, glad she did too. I think you would have found life under ECS yoke far less desirable than even fighting them. I was thinking that while it\u2019s been well established that this is just a temporary alliance, a couple people were correct in that we probably should have a single leader instead of all of us just shouting ideas. More will get accomplished quicker if you just become the leader. I doubt if anyone is going to have any major objections.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well I guess it probably makes the most sense. You seem to have genuine experience in fighting the ECS though, sure you don\u2019t want to do it?\u201d you half joke.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve never been a leader. I have been an advisor on more than one occasion though, so I\u2019ll do that if you need.\u201d\n\nA few days after you\u2019ve had your meeting with the independents, you meet up with Mara who has brought Marco with her. You haven\u2019t been looking forward to this meeting.\n\nYou only met him in person once before the first time Mara brought him around two years ago, but he\u2019s grown as well. He still has that tone of arrogance in his voice like he knows everything of course. If anything he\u2019s even worse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we\u2019re waiting around for a bunch of old fucks before striking at these assholes. Word has it, that they\u2019ve been setting up in a general store on Typhoon street. Me and my Black Hooks could easily take them out! We\u2019ve been waiting for something like this, we got the gear and we\u2019re ready!\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cYeah? Well you\u2019ll be even more ready if you\u2019re just a bit more patient Marco. We need to coordinate plans, not go in half assed. I figured Mara explained this already to you.\u201d You reply.\n\nMarco scowls a bit.\n\n\u201cHey look, I know this guy is your dad and he deals fairly with us with fencing shit, but he needs to know he can\u2019t just tell me what to do. I\u2019M the leader of the Black Hooks and after we\u2019re done wiping out these Ebony Claw assholes, we\u2019re going to be stepping things up to run this entire city!\u201d\n\u201cGreat, so Mara have the Claw been in contact with any Black Hooks?\u201d you say already getting sick of talking to Marco and deciding to speak with Mara instead.\n\u201cHEY! I\u2019m the fucking leader! You supposed to be fucking talking to ME about this shit, not my girlfriend!\u201d\n\u201cFirst off, I\u2019ll talk to who the fuck I want, especially my daughter. Second, I thought you guys broke up.\u201d\n\nMarco\u2019s face drops and he looks more scared than angry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you told him?! You promised you wouldn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cNo! No! I just told him we broke up!\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m missing something here.\u201d You say.\n\nThe rest of the short meeting mostly consists of Mara trying to calm Marco down. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all about, but you\u2019ve gotten the impression that it\u2019s something embarrassing.\n\nBy the time Marco does calm down, he\u2019s even pissier with you and now he\u2019s upset with Mara (Though he doesn\u2019t get outright angry) Ultimately he grudgingly accepts the plan of waiting until everyone is ready.\n\nYou nearly ask Mara what that was all about after he leaves, but you figure maybe it should wait for now. You just tell her to continue to be the rational influence in the Black Hooks.\n\nYou have another meeting later on that week with Sneaks who has already gathered a bit of information on the ECS. He tells you contrary to what Marco believes, they are NOT all gathered in a general store on Typhoon Street. He mentions that\u2019s just some front they\u2019re already starting to set up. He mentions their real base isn\u2019t even in the city; it\u2019s in some small ruin on the island.\n\n\u201cYou followed them outside the city?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, looks like an abandoned temple of Fel. I\u2019m really not surprised given their history.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cSome of the ECS, mostly the higher ranking ones, have connections to Fel. You\u2019re aware of who that is right?\u201d\n\u201cSure, god of shadows. Some rogues are into him though most pray to Yag.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s probably because most rogues aren\u2019t actively religious and it\u2019s easier to say few half assed praises to a god who\u2019s just rolling the dice anyway. Dedication to Fel, and I mean true dedication to Fel is a little more involved, but it does seem to have benefits and I\u2019ve seen those unfortunately in action when I was in Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cShit. Are you telling me these folks have divine powers?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not all of them, not even most of them. In fact I doubt if any of the ones sent here do. I\u2019m just saying there is a history for high ranking leaders to have shadow powers. In any case, I believe there about thirty or so of them here. It\u2019s definitely going to be a fight whenever we attack.\u201d\n\u201cThirty is a lot more than I expected.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well they probably were keeping stuff like that secret so if anyone tried anything now, they could determine who was going to be a problem and retaliate in force if they needed to.\u201d\n\nSneaks goes on to suggest that perhaps the Black Hooks should lead the assault since Marco is so eager. In fact he actually goes so far to not so subtly suggest that something should happen to Marco in particular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of wondering where this conversation is going Sneaks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, we both know the Black Hooks are a potential problem in the future. I mean yeah they won\u2019t be the ECS, but they could start getting pretty territorial really fast if left unchecked. I\u2019m just saying that the rest of us do a little less to help them and let them take most of the casualties. And if some of them just happen to accidentally get shot by a stray bullet or bolt\u2026well shit happens.\u201d Sneaks remarks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026pretty damn shady. Though I have to admit, I do see the logic in it, and I might actually consider it except for one major thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cMara is in the Black Hooks and I\u2019m not exactly keen on using her as fodder.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll just let everyone else know that your daughter is off limits and is not to be targeted.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I mean its one thing to let the Black Hooks take the brunt of the casualties, but it\u2019s completely another thing to actively kill them in the middle of the fight when we\u2019re supposed to be on the same side. Also while Mara might get spared, it\u2019s going to be awfully suspicious if she\u2019s the only Black Hook survivor. We may not be fond of them, but some of these people are her friends. She isn\u2019t a stupid girl and will make her own conclusions.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s up to you, but I just don\u2019t see it as a bad idea.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Deal with the Black Hooks fairly", "result": "While the Black Hooks are mostly a bunch of dumb obnoxious teenagers, they\u2019re still exactly that, a bunch of dumb obnoxious teenagers. Other than Marco, most of the ones you\u2019ve had dealings with haven\u2019t really been hostile towards you. Most of them are probably going to get themselves kill during this fight anyway, no need for any sort of treachery.\n\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t afford to start stabbing our allies in the back, especially in this situation. I\u2019m fairly certain the ECS is going to be doing a good enough job of whittling their numbers down anyway.\u201d\n\u201cProbably right. Just providing alternatives. So should we go over when and how we\u2019re going to plan this attack?\u201d\n\nYou and Sneaks first go over the plans a few times, then you share this information with the rest of the Jicol Alliance, after sharing it with them, you share it with the Black Hooks.\n\nYou still aren\u2019t sure of when to attack since you want to make sure to get most if not all in one area and not have to chase any down, given how impatient Marco is getting and the fact that you\u2019re really never going to know for sure when the best time is, you just decide to do it sooner rather than later, especially since you\u2019re as ready as you all are going to get.\n\nYou spend the day before the attack mostly getting yourself mentally prepared for this. You haven\u2019t killed anyone since Klint and murder in general wasn\u2019t really something you ever wanted make a habit of doing. However, you do know it\u2019s within you to do it and you\u2019re going to have to do it multiple times soon. You just take into consideration that Mara is going to be in danger the whole time and you\u2019re going to have to kill in order to make sure she doesn\u2019t die.\n\nNot that you think she\u2019s going to be helpless, but it\u2019s a better frame of mind to put yourself in if you\u2019re thinking that way for this task.\n\nYour forces attack the ECS hideout at night. You actually tell the Black Hooks to stay back a bit since they\u2019re more likely to be sloppier and you\u2019re trying to keep this attack as silent as possible before an alarm is raised.\n\nYou and some of the others sneak around and take out a few of the Claws on the perimeter. After about taking care of the ones outside, that\u2019s when you signal for the Black Hooks (and everyone else) to follow you in.\n\nYou actually manage to make it down to the lower level of this temple before on of the Black Hooks\u2019 lack of experience start calling attention to the attack and before you know it, the alarm is at last raised. It was good while it lasted.\n\nThe underground level to this place is almost maze like, with Ebony Claws coming out from behind every corner. You actually manage to stop a few of the Black Hooks from getting killed by pointing out traps that they nearly step on or trip. In fact, they start sticking close to you, Marco or the other more experienced thieves rather than just going off half assed.\n\nThe whole time this is going on, you\u2019re still trying to keep an eye on Mara who you\u2019ve seen take out at least one person. You aren\u2019t sure if she\u2019s done that before or this is her first time. You guess you\u2019ll ask after this is all over.\n\nBullets, bolts, arrows, blades and traps of all kinds are dodged or blocked many times in this battle. The Ebony Claws fight back with everything they got, which includes several, fire powder bombs that take out a large part of your forces, enough to even up the odds.\n\nFor your own dislike of the arrogant prick, Marco is actually being a deciding factor in keeping most of the remaining Black Hooks from just turning away and running. You sort of expected him to just be full of bravado and shit his pants when things got bad, but he\u2019s really stepping up.\n\nEventually you, Mara, Marco and a few others reach what you believe to be an altar room of some sort. You see Nathan and his friend that came with him when they first met you.\n\n\u201cYou fucking idiots. You have no idea of the deep shit you\u2019re all in. You really think even if you some how manage to kill all of us this day, that you\u2019re going to get away with it? Kill them all except that fucker right there, I wanna take my time with him.\u201d Nathan shouts while pointing at you.\n\nNathan at this point spout some sort of gibberish and become blurry and you\u2019re having a hard time focusing on him. It would seem that Sneaks wasn\u2019t entirely correct about none of their number having access to shadow magic.\n\n\u201cMarco, you and me deal with the magic asshole, the rest of you cut the other one down and then help us!\u201d you shout.\n\nNathan is moving at a speed that you can barely defend against. If it wasn\u2019t for Marco providing an extra target, you might very well be losing badly though given how it\u2019s going, you still aren\u2019t doing too well.\n\nNathan slashes you across the face with his knife, kicks you in the balls and then slams you to the floor. He then punches you multiple times in the face before Marco manages to recover from his own previous beating and get Nathan off of you by stabbing him in the back.\n\n\u201cBastard!\u201d Nathan grunts and backhands the teen to the floor. Nathan still has more than enough fight in him. He begins cutting up Marco who is desperately trying to cover himself. He manages to roll away and quickly stand up, but he\u2019s losing a lot of blood from all the cuts.\n\nMeanwhile Mara has finally finished off Nathan\u2019s friend and is the only one left from that combat. She rushes in to help you and Marco.\n\nMara attempts to stab Nathan, but he anticipates the move and rather than just dodging it, he spins behind Marco causing her to run him through instead. Mara is in so much shock at what she\u2019s done, Nathan takes advantage and pushes Marco\u2019s dying body towards her, causing them both to fall to the floor with her partially trapped underneath.\n\nFortunately for you, Nathan is a bit of a gloater and hasn\u2019t been paying attention to you like he should. While he was kicking Marco\u2019s ass and spouting how stupid it was to oppose the ECS to Mara, you\u2019ve managed to reload your flintlock.\n\nEven with your face half beaten and Nathan already a bit blurring from his shadow magic shit he\u2019s using, you\u2019re not missing at this range.\n\nYou fire and you hit Nathan squarely in the kneecap. He screams in agony and collapses. You always heard it was the most painful place to get shot, you never quite believed that before now, because Nathan isn\u2019t just screaming he\u2019s actually crying and praying to Fel to rescue him.\n\nIf Fel was listening, he apparently didn\u2019t give a shit, because while Nathan was crying and screaming, Mara recovered from her shock rolled out from under Marco and starts stabbing the shit out of him.\n\nBy the time you stagger over to Mara, Nathan is a bloody mess.\n\n\u201cMara, Mara, I think he\u2019s dead.\u201d You say touching her shoulder. She looks at you with tears and blood over her face and then stands up to hug you.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re still alive! I couldn\u2019t bear to lose you too! So many\u2026so many of my friends\u2026\u201d she says.\n\u201cI know. I know. But we\u2019re alive. That\u2019s the important thing. Other than the obvious, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cPhysically I guess. I mean I feel better than you look right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou also look better than I look too.\u201d You attempt to joke.\n\u201cI always did.\u201d Mara says with a faint smile.\n\u201cHah. Shit, Let me just lean up against this altar for a moment.\u201d You say and start reloading your flintlock with another shot.\n\n\u201cDo you know if we won?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cI believe we might have won this particular battle. Hopefully none of them got away because I\u2019m not really in any condition to go chasing them down.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d\n\u201cWell that is the question I suppose. I imagine we\u2019re really not going to know if we\u2019re in the clear or not for a while. As I said, the ECS may or may not send more folks here eventually to check on what happened. I\u2019m gonna bet that they will and hopefully not many. If and when that day comes we\u2019re going to have to deal with them too. We may even be looking over our shoulder for the rest of our lives if they find out exactly who wiped out everyone, but then again how is that different from how it is now right?\u201d\n\nYour conversation with Mara is interrupted by Sneaks who wanders in cautiously. He notes the carnage in the room and nods.\n\n\u201cPhew, looks like I missed quite the battle here.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cYes, but is there still fighting going on elsewhere?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, in fact I\u2019m pretty sure we got them all. I counted thirty-six bodies, not counting these two on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like there were more than you previously thought.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, apologies. Curse these old eyes.\u201d\n\u201cYou know this one had those shadow magic powers you mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cHe did? Shit. Again, my apologies. I really didn\u2019t think they would bother to send someone like that here. At least not initially, they usually hold back their heavies for more important tasks.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, establishing a new base of operations and taking over new territory seems pretty important to me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess so. But in any case we won. We probably should clean up the bodies and make it seem like nobody was ever here. Also need to hit that storefront in town. There are probably a few there as well. \u201c\n\u201cShit, nearly forgot about that. We still have people left in fighting condition?\u201d\n\u201cNot many, but I think the few that we do will be more than willing to go now.\u201d\n\u201cGood, send them over then.\u201d\n\nSneaks nods and tells you he\u2019s glad to see you and your daughter made it through this alive before leaving. Mara noticing you frowning a bit.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mara asks.\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe nothing. I mean Sneaks has been pretty helpful\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026bah maybe I just have trust issues.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to explain to me. It\u2019s not like you can trust too many people in this line of work.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you can always trust me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI suppose I can.\u201d\n\nYou and Mara leave the bloody room with several bodies behind you. You aren\u2019t quite sure what the future holds next, but you survived this day and that\u2019s enough for now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 35\n\nA hand reaches for the pouch on your nearby dresser; you grab it and open your eyes.\n\n\u201cNope, still not quick or stealthy enough.\u201d You say and let go of Mara\u2019s hand.\n\u201cHow the hell do you do that? I know I was dead silent that time!\u201d Mara remarks.\n\u201cJust comes with natural talent I suppose.\u201d\n\nMara at this point playfully punches your arm and sits on the side of the bed, as you sit up.\n\n\u201cA little early to be harassing me like this don\u2019t you think?\u201d you say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the afternoon as usual.\u201d Mara tells you.\n\u201cWell unless the Ebony Claws have been sighted, you know I don\u2019t like getting up early\u2026they haven\u2019t have they?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard. Though Sneaks wants to talk to you about a matter concerning that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, he\u2019s been wanting to talk for a few days now. Guess I better get over to him today. He\u2019s been acting sort of odd lately. Well I guess I better get going\u2026um\u2026Mara?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI gotta get dressed.\u201d\n\u201cSo don\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d\n\u201cWell what I mean is, I sort of need privacy, I mean I\u2019m covered by the sheets right now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026don\u2019t really want to hear or know about any little boyfriends you\u2019ve been seeing.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about boyfriends.\u201d Mara says with a smirk.\n\nNow the conversation has really gotten strange.\n\n\u201cWait a minute, you haven\u2019t been spying on me have you?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cRelax, I accidently walked in on you asleep once and you were, shall we say less covered up.\u201d Mara says.\n\nYou feel sort of weird. Slightly embarrassed even. This causes some amusement from Mara.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave. You\u2019re oddly reserved at times.\u201d Mara says and then kisses you on cheek before she leaves.\n\nHonestly, you\u2019ve been getting some weird vibes from Mara lately. Sometimes it feels like she\u2019s flirting with you.\n\nWhich under normal circumstances, you\u2019d probably be perfectly fine with some pretty nineteen year old girl doing that, however in Mara\u2019s case you have severe mixed feelings about it.\n\nOf course maybe you\u2019re just reading too much into things, and you\u2019re just the pervert thinking dirty thoughts. Which doesn\u2019t make it much better because that\u2019s been also increasing lately.\n\nTrying not to think about any of that too much longer, you get dressed and head to where Sneaks likes to drink. He tends to be in there a lot so you figure you\u2019ve got a good chance of catching him there.\n\nYou\u2019re in luck and you do in fact see him. He sees you and waves you over.\n\nTen minutes later\u2026\n\n\u201cAre you fucking serious Sneaks?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cSorry it had to come to this, but after that devastating ECS attack last year, it was decided that you shouldn\u2019t be in charge of the Jicol Alliance anymore.\u201d Sneaks remarks.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really in charge of it before as I remember. It was just supposed to be a loose agreement that we unite whenever the Ebony Claws attack. All I did was organize shit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well it was also decided that the Jicol Alliance should be a more permanent institution given the constant threat that the ECS poses.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! And when was all this decided?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think that\u2019s relevant. What is relevant is it\u2019s done and you\u2019re out. Now of course you\u2019re allowed to continue to help in the unified defense of our interests in this city. You and your girlfriend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDaughter!\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course, my mistake. As I was saying you of course will be allowed in contributing to help when the ECS inevitably comes to attack again. I believe forty percent of your earnings monthly should provide an adequate sum to go towards our defense. Perhaps it could be used to bribe the Captain of the Watch. Get the law to work for us for a change\u2026\u201d\n\nYou knew it. You knew all those years ago you should have just shot this asshole in that altar room. He\u2019s built up his own little circle of friends and turned the Jicol Alliance into a thieves\u2019s guild with himself as head of it of course.\n\nAngered by what Sneaks is trying to pull here, you stand up and point you finger in his face. Nearby tavern dwellers take notice and you also notice some of them look ready to pull their weapons. Some are new but many are familiar faces. Part of the new Jicol Alliance of course.\n\n\u201cLook, you want to form your own guild with yourself as leader, fine. You can have that fucking headache. You want me to help out when the ECS shows up, fine, I\u2019ll help. What you\u2019re NOT going to do however is start trying to fucking extort me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, sorry you feel that way, but I\u2019m afraid that this isn\u2019t up for negotiation. This is unfortunately for you this is a with us or against us situation. Of course your other option is to leave, I certainly wouldn\u2019t stop you. I respect you enough to do that at least.\u201d Sneaks responds.\n\u201cYeah, thank you and fuck you.\u201d\n\nSneaks\u2019 expression now turns to one of irritation.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to let that slide because I know this is all pretty upsetting for you.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cUpset? Upset? We\u2019re pretty much past fucking upset! I should just fucking kill you right now, and don\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t be fast enough.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cYou\u2019re completely right of course, but you\u2019d never make it out of here alive. Even if you somehow did, you\u2019d be on the run from the Jicol Watch for killing me in public.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I\u2019d have the satisfaction of killing you.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know while I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not probably not interested I could try to explain why I did what I did. Wasn\u2019t like I had this planned from the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cOh great the rationale to clear your guilt. Pfft. Well fine, might as well hear it. I could use a good laugh after all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I ever told you about my friend Garrick?\u201d Sneaks asks.\n\u201cYeah maybe, said you and he ran the thieves\u2019 guild in Holgard.\u201d You answer in exasperation.\n\u201cGarrick was a thief, but he had a strong sense of honor, probably too much in our line of work. You actually reminded me of him when you first came proposing the Jicol Alliance to take the fight to the Ebony Claws. Guess that\u2019s another reason why I stuck around. I always was a bit too idealistic, even in my old age now. You, much like him, made it really sound like we would win and drive out the Claws. I was ready to follow and I did for many years.\u201d\n\u201cSo what did you do? Stab him in the back too?\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I didn\u2019t, though I always wondered if I shouldn\u2019t have been so loyal and blindly accepting of his orders as he made one foolish decision after another that eventually got himself and almost everyone else wiped out by the ECS. Maybe if I had, I\u2019d still be in Holgard, perhaps even running things there.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what this is all about? Your boring desire for power?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s more of a side benefit and if I THOUGHT you were still the leader you were the first time we opposed the Ebony Claws, I wouldn\u2019t have even done this. Each year they\u2019ve attacked, we\u2019ve suffered more losses. I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re going to survive another, but I know if YOU\u2019RE in charge we won\u2019t, so you had to be removed. Look, I\u2019m probably older than I have any right to be in our line of work, but I\u2019ve learned this. I like living, I like surviving, and the only way I\u2019m going to feel like I\u2019m going to continue doing that is if I have complete control over my fate, rather than it being in your hands.\u201d\n\u201cIf you wanted to be in charge, you could have just fucking asked. Instead of all this shit you\u2019ve pulled and extorting me on top of all of it.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe I\u2019ve handled this poorly, but it\u2019s been my experience that men in power, no matter how reluctant or how miniscule, do not give it up willingly. Garrick certainly wouldn\u2019t have and he wasn\u2019t a power hungry man, just like you\u2019re not. However, a good leader needs to be focused and much like Garrick, you are not focused.\u201d\n\u201cOh well apologies that my life doesn\u2019t revolve around you all the damn time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you mean, I\u2019m done listening to your long winded story about your excuses.\u201d\n\nAs you start to stand up to leave, Sneaks suddenly shouts at you to stop. Sneaks usually never shouts so actually gets your attention (along with several other people in the tavern)\n\n\u201cYou wanna know another thing you and Garrick had in common? You both had a young girl in your care. A daughter of sorts if you will. One that you do your best to try treat as adult, but always have that streak of overprotective fatherly love for her. It\u2019s an admirable trait, but it\u2019s at odds for that other emotion in you. And that\u2019s a love for her as a regular woman, because that\u2019s what she is now. Maybe young, but she\u2019s a woman nonetheless given what\u2019s she\u2019s seen and done. I see it and you REALLY see it.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cSneaks, you don\u2019t want to go there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and neither do you. Garrick didn\u2019t either and it compromised his ability to lead. Besides all the inner turmoil the man probably felt about the morality of the situation, he constantly tried to make sure his little girl was safe\u2026never mind that in his case she was half fucking demon in question, but the problem you both have is the same. You\u2019re always going to place your girlfriend over the organization. Last year that was never more apparent.\u201d\n\u201cHow the fuck can you say that? She\u2019s risking her life along with everyone else!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but only in a limited capacity. You always make sure she\u2019s on the less dangerous tasks. I\u2019m not even mad about it. As I said, it\u2019s completely understandable that you want to protect your girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cYou call her my girlfriend one more time and you\u2019re going to have a short lived reign as Alliance leader.\u201d You say leaning forward into the table.\n\nSneaks leans forward as well, meeting your gaze.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not judging you. She\u2019s not really your\u2026y\u2019know what? This isn\u2019t my business. Sort out your own personal issues on this situation, but I think your real fear is the girl might just feel the same way. In any case, I\u2019ll be expecting my cut by the end of this month. If I have the coin, then I\u2019ll know I have your cooperation, if I don\u2019t receive the payment, then I\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSneaks then motions for you to leave as if now you can leave. You gladly do so, swearing the whole time.\n\nYour mind races about what you can do, what you need to do, what you should do. You really didn\u2019t need this right now. Not when your mind has been preoccupied with other things. Other things that Sneaks also got in your head about.\n\nYou\u2019ve got an incredible headache by the time you make it home. You just hope Mara isn\u2019t lingering around, because you don\u2019t think you have the energy to deal with all this yet. She\u2019s probably going to want to fight rather than leave.\n\nAs you open the door to your home, you suddenly feel the sharp jab of a crossbow pointed right at your lower back.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around, just get inside.\u201d A low voice says to you.\n\nYou raise your hands and slowly walk inside your home where you see a man completely dressed in black leather and wearing an eye patch. You don\u2019t know who this person is, but you can guess where they\u2019re from.\n\n\u201cEbony Claw\u2026great. Perfect end to a fucked up day.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, seems I caught the leader of the Jicol Alliance at a bad time? Well too bad, we\u2019ve got shit to discuss. Bolt, you can leave, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d The man says.\n\nYou feel the pressure taken off of your lower back and then the front door closing behind you.\n\n\u201cGotta say, figured the Alliance leader would have a better place than this, but then I guess you\u2019re not doing too badly. Anyway have a seat, as I said we\u2019ve got shit to discuss.\u201d\n\nThis asshole no doubt has shadow powers like Nathan and a couple of the other ECS lieutenants you\u2019ve faced in the past. Still, like all of their type he\u2019s arrogant enough to not even relieved you of your weapons and doesn\u2019t even have another person with him save for the guy that just left.\n\nWhatever he\u2019s going to say is most likely going to just be some sort of lie or unreasonable offer. Not to mention the fact that you aren\u2019t exactly the leader of the Jicol Alliance anymore and if he knows that, then he\u2019s going to wonder what the point is with dealing with you.\n\nStill, he could be more powerful than what you\u2019ve usually faced, or he might even have some advantage like say having Mara hostage somewhere. He seems to know something about you after all. You could at least listen to him while you figure out a better plan than just trying to be quicker on the draw than he is.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot him", "result": "No sooner have you pulled your pistol, when the man quickly speaks something and waves his hand making all your surroundings go pitch black.\n\nYou fire wildly and miss him of course. Then you feel a blade going into your neck.\n\nThe unnatural darkness lifts hen you fall to the ground and see the man standing over you as you choke on your own blood\n\n\u201cThat was a very silly thing to do. I was going to offer you a deal. Now your rashness has doomed your precious Alliance when you might have saved it.\u201d He says shaking his head.\n\nIt hardly matters that he doesn\u2019t know the truth since you\u2019re dead before he walks back out the door to methodically murder the rest of the Jicol Alliance himself.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Listen to him", "result": "With the day it\u2019s been, you might as well.\n\nYou take a seat and watch the Syndicate rep take a few steps back and forth before pulling up a nearby chair to sit as well. You didn\u2019t expect him to be so casual.\n\n\u201cOkay, first off, my name is Rook and you\u2019re probably wondering why I haven\u2019t just killed you immediately.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cInformation on you lot is always fucking spotty thanks to your location and the fact you\u2019ve been fairly successful at keeping us off this island and that\u2019s been an advantage. I, however have been doing my own leg work for a few days, and while I don\u2019t know everything about you lot yet, I know enough that you\u2019re the leader, and you\u2019ve got a pretty young girlfriend.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cActually she\u2019s my daughter.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cTruly? Hm, the way you two interact\u2026well I\u2019m not here to judge your family business. In any case, sooner or later the Syndicate leadership is going to get it\u2019s head out of its collective ass and actually implement a plan that works instead of trying the same damn thing over and over believing that it will. I swear, it\u2019s like fucking Holgard all over again.\u201d\n\nRook shakes his head at his remark before continuing.\n\n\u201cHowever, before that happens I\u2019m here to offer you a one time deal mainly because change in ECS leadership can only come when dedicated individuals take the initiative on squandered opportunities, such as this place. Especially when they can do it with minimal resource waste.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re wondering if Rook\u2019s henchman should have just killed you with a bolt to the back, because this fucker loves the sound of his own pontificating so much that he\u2019s killing you with boredom.\n\n\u201cYou are obviously a dedicated man of convictions. I imagine you believe that the ECS is going to just come in and take away what you consider freedom hence why you\u2019ve fought us for several years now. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you, you\u2019re right BUT if you make a deal with me right now, I will make sure this city remains more or less out of the eye of the Syndicate. You will just give me personally forty percent of what the Jicol Alliance earns monthly and of course there will be some of my people to oversee things just to make sure there are no more attempts at opposing us.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cYou personally? Won\u2019t the Syndicate high ups object to that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh the appropriate people will be getting a cut too, you don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose if I say no, you\u2019ll kill me right now.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, I\u2019ll just leave and let you wait for the inevitable. As I said, I\u2019m here on my own accord. I don\u2019t particularly have any grand interest in this place unless it\u2019s a potential extra moneymaker for me with minimal effort. I promise you though; the Syndicate will take this place eventually. So it\u2019s either deal with me now and endure indentured servitude or deal with the Syndicate later and face extinction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s good deal actually; it\u2019s so good in fact you start laughing due to the fact that you can\u2019t agree to it, but you do come up with a different one.\n\n\u201cRook, I\u2019ve got an even better deal for you. How about you and all your people just take this place over completely, but I don\u2019t have to give you anything at all and my family just continues to do their own business without interference?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWha\u2026what are you talking about?\u201d Rook asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m unfortunately not the leader of the Jicol Alliance anymore. One of my closest advisors basically just deposed me and it\u2019s now officially a guild rather than a loose collection of vagabonds only united for self-defense.\u201d\n\u201cWait, when the fuck did this happen!?\u201d\n\u201cNot long before you ambushed me. If you\u2019re thinking about going to him with the same deal though I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why the fuck shouldn\u2019t I? In fact is there any reason why I shouldn\u2019t kill you for wasting my time?\n\u201cBecause the guy currently in charge said he fought you lot in Holgard and has no intention on ever giving up to you. In fact part of the reason he strong-armed his way as leader is because he felt I wasn\u2019t doing a good enough job. Should have known you couldn\u2019t trust a guy that calls himself Sneaks.\u201d\n\nRook\u2019s one good eye widens and stands up suddenly.\n\n\u201cDid you just say Sneaks?\u201d Rook asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d you answer.\n\u201cThat fucker is here? In this city?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know him?\u201d\n\u201cKnow him? That\u2019s the sonofabitch that took out my fucking eye! He was part of the Holgard Guild that gave me fucking grief for YEARS! I\u2019ve been trying to track down that cocksucker for so long that I can\u2019t even believe you\u2019re telling me that he\u2019s right here!\u201d\n\u201cI know where he stays and how many other Alliance members there are.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring anyone else along on this trip save for my friend Bolt and while I don\u2019t doubt we couldn\u2019t handle this ourselves, but I\u2019ll tell you what, as an act of trust if you come help us, you\u2019ve got a deal that all your family\u2019s business dealings and activities will not be taxed by the Syndicate or even by me personally. I swear to Fel and all the shadows that this will be so.\u201d Rook says making some sort of weird gesture afterwards.\n\nNormally you\u2019d be skeptical about such a thing, but Rook seems really dedicated to Fel and making declarations like that before one\u2019s god is usually a pretty serious thing so you\u2019re fairly sure he\u2019s being truthful. Not to mention he sounds like he hates Sneaks more than anything else.\n\nYou give Rook all the necessary information and he tells you to meet him at Sneak\u2019s favorite tavern in thirty minutes. You remind Rook that this is a public place, but he tells you once again, not to worry about it and leaves.\n\nAs you\u2019re taking the opportunity to get ready for this (and feeling a little upbeat at the same time about it) Mara comes walking in.\n\n\u201cHey dad, who was that guy who just came from the house? He looked really creepy. Almost reminded me of one of those Ebony Claw guys that have the shadow powers.\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably because he was.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWHAT!?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I expected that response. I can\u2019t go into too much detail, but A LOT happened from between the time you left this afternoon and now.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re going to have to at least try to explain it to me!\u201d\n\nAs quickly as you can (And most of it is walking and talking) you fill her in on everything that\u2019s happened. It\u2019s a lot for her to take in, but her main concern seems to be you and her.\n\n\u201cHow can we trust this Rook guy? I mean we\u2019ve been fighting the ECS for years and he\u2019s just going to let us go?\u201d Mara says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the deal. As I said, Rook seems to be more interested in building up his own personal powerbase than as the ECS as a whole. And right now he seems to be more interested in revenge. I\u2019d say we\u2019re the least of his concerns. He doesn\u2019t even need me to help, he just said if I did, he\u2019d honor the deal and considering he made it before his shadow god that\u2019s another reason I don\u2019t have cause to doubt him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell\u2026if you think so.\u201d\n\u201cI have to say, I thought you\u2019d be more opposed to the idea.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not exactly thrilled with it, but given that Sneaks and the rest betrayed you, I can see the wisdom in just making a deal to protect our own asses. Personally I\u2019m still hoping they all kill each other, but I\u2019ll personally make sure not to target any Ebony Claw members.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really need to come, it\u2019s just me that promised.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m coming too, I\u2019m not going to miss a chance of getting a measure of revenge on the lot that betrayed us too. But I do always think it\u2019s sweet that you always try to keep me safe. You always look out for me.\u201d Mara says and puts her arm around you briefly and gives you a peck on the cheek.\n\nEven in this bit of grim business that you\u2019re about to engage in, Mara\u2019s actions manage to still make you feel the more anxious than anything else. The way she looks at you with love in her eyes\u2026\n\nSneaks was right.\n\nThat\u2019s what this is and it\u2019s clearly there between there between the pair of you.\n\nThis is probably wrong, but you might very well die in a few minutes so\u2026\n\nYou grab Mara around the waist and kiss her deeply. When you finally come up for air you both stare at each other.\n\n\u201cThat was wrong wasn\u2019t it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, probably.\u201d Mara replies.\n\u201cI keep having inappropriate thoughts about you.\u201d\n\u201cDo they involve taking me from behind and slapping my ass while I call you daddy?\u201d\n\u201cThey do now.\u201d\n\u201cThen we better hurry up and kill these assholes then.\u201d\n\nYou and Mara rush to where you\u2019re supposed to meet Rook. When you arrive he tells you that there aren\u2019t any of the Jicol Watch around and there won\u2019t be, so the place is going to be fair game. He mentions don\u2019t worry about anyone trying to escape either since Bolt will be outside taking care of that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see your friend.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd neither will anyone else. I see you brought your daughter along. Good. Extra help is always welcome.\u201d\n\u201cActually she\u2019s my girlfriend.\u201d You say proudly causing a bit of a smile from Mara.\n\nRook just stares for a moment, opens his mouth and then stops.\n\n\u201cNevermind. I\u2019m too anxious to kill Sneaks right now. Which brings me to another thing, don\u2019t kill him! You can cripple him, maim him or whatever to stop him from attacking you. I don\u2019t give a good fuck what condition he\u2019s in, just as long as he\u2019s alive long enough for me to piss in his face before he dies.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cGood, you two go in, I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d\n\nYou and Mara go into the tavern.\n\nNo sooner has Sneaks seen the pair of you, he already calls for his people to start attacking. Say what you want about Sneaks, but he\u2019s not stupid and knows an attack when he sees it.\n\nOf course unfortunately for him, you\u2019ve got very dedicated follower of Fel on your side. Before you even engage one of Sneaks\u2019 men, he has already killed two of them using his shadow magic enhanced speed. It\u2019s a damn good thing you didn\u2019t attack this guy. He\u2019s way more powerful than any of the others you faced in the past. He\u2019s not just a blur, he\u2019s practically invisible.\n\nAll non-combatants just try to keep their head down as the carnage ensues. Sneaks himself tries to run out the back, but you manage to get in a good shot to the side of his leg, specifically around the knee area. Such an effective place, Sneaks goes crashing to the floor immediately screaming the whole time. He goes for his own pistol, but Mara grabs his hands and stabs daggers through both palms and into the floor.\n\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t kill me \u2026(sob) I\u2019ll leave!\u201d Sneaks whimpers.\n\u201cToo late for that I\u2019m afraid. But I should think you for being right about one thing. Mara and I decided to give into our feelings after all. When all this is over with, we\u2019re going to REALLY give into them. Thanks for showing me the light, now I think it\u2019s time I show you the shadows. I think you know this guy. Apparently he\u2019s been looking for you for a long time.\u201d\n\nRook suddenly becomes more visible to your eyes and stands over Sneaks who looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost from the past.\n\n\u201c\u2026YOU! No! Please no! Not him!\u201d Sneaks screams at you.\n\u201cGood, you remember me. Now you remember this cocksucker?\u201d Rook shouts and then flips up his eye patch revealing a solid black gem, which then shoots a black light into one of Sneaks\u2019 own eyes.\n\nSneaks screams in agony that you kill him as his eye gets destroyed by the black light.\n\nSensing that Rook is going to take his time, you decide to ask if you\u2019re done.\n\n\u201cSo, should we just leave you to it then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re good. Bolt and I can hunt down the rest myself. Talk to you later before I leave.\u201d Rook says waving you away and now getting ready to burn out Sneaks\u2019 other eye.\n\nYou and Mara leave the tavern with Sneaks\u2019 screams still in both of your ears. Surprisingly there\u2019s nobody even remotely around nearby outside and you know there was quite a bit of noise made inside. You dunno what the hell Rook did to make that happened, but you can\u2019t help think he did some sort of shadow magic shit.\n\nNone of that matter right now to you though, and by the time you get home, the only thing that matters is what\u2019s going between you and Mara in the bed.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Use treachery", "result": "Sneaks is correct, the Black Hooks are going to be just as big of an issue later on. Sure they may be just a bunch of obnoxious teenagers that are half assed thugs and thieves now, but eventually they\u2019re going to get smarter, better and more aggressive. And you already know that Marco has ideas about his gang eventually controlling the entire city.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s grim business, but we probably should. We\u2019ll let the Black Hooks go charging in first. I\u2019m going to try to keep Mara close to me, but if she should get away from me, I don\u2019t have to tell you that she isn\u2019t to be targeted. Also you need to make sure she doesn\u2019t see anyone killing a Black Hook member.\u201d you say.\n\u201cGoes without saying. So should we go over when and how we\u2019re going to plan this attack?\u201d Sneaks asks.\n\nYou and Sneaks first go over the plans a few times, then you share this information with the rest of the Jicol Alliance, after sharing it with them, you share it with the Black Hooks.\n\nYou still aren\u2019t sure of when to attack since you want to make sure to get most if not all in one area and not have to chase any down, given how impatient Marco is getting and the fact that you\u2019re really never going to know for sure when the best time is, you just decide to do it sooner rather than later, especially since you\u2019re as ready as you all are going to get.\n\nYou spend the day before the attack mostly getting yourself mentally prepared for this. You haven\u2019t killed anyone since Klint and murder in general wasn\u2019t really something you ever wanted make a habit of doing. However, you do know it\u2019s within you to do it and you\u2019re going to have to do it multiple times soon. You just take into consideration that Mara is going to be in danger the whole time and you\u2019re going to have to kill in order to make sure she doesn\u2019t die.\n\nNot that you think she\u2019s going to be helpless, but it\u2019s a better frame of mind to put yourself in if you\u2019re thinking that way for this task.\n\nYour forces attack the ECS hideout at night. You tell the Black Hooks to take the lead and eliminate the outside sentries first.\n\nThey almost succeed in doing it stealthy, but of course some of them fail in a quiet kill and an alarm has already been raised.\n\nThe fight on the first floor isn\u2019t too bad, but by the time you get to the underground level which is like a maze, the Black Hooks are dropping like flies. Besides getting killed by Ebony Claws lurking around every corner, they\u2019re not paying attention to how trapped this place is. At the rate they\u2019re dying, nobody will have to bother stabbing any in the back.\n\nThe whole time this is going on, you\u2019re still trying to keep an eye on Mara who you\u2019ve seen take out at least one person. You aren\u2019t sure if she\u2019s done that before or this is her first time. You guess you\u2019ll ask after this is all over.\n\nBullets, bolts, arrows, blades and traps of all kinds are dodged or blocked many times in this battle. The Ebony Claws fight back with everything they got, which includes several, fire powder bombs that take out a large part of your forces, enough to tip the odds in their favor mainly because the Black Hooks have been completely decimated and now the Alliance is starting to take the casualties.\n\nWhile you planned on killing Marco yourself, he\u2019s already dead from getting blown to pieces by a firebomb. Say what you want about the guy, he actually was keeping the remaining Black Hooks from running away. You have no doubt that the run aways will be killed by Alliance members lagging behind, though you\u2019re starting to think that employing treachery might not have been the way to go about this.\n\nEventually you and Mara, reach what you believe to be an altar room of some sort. You see Nathan and his friend that came with him when they first met you.\n\n\u201cYou fucking idiots. You have no idea of the deep shit you\u2019re all in. You really think even if you some how manage to kill all of us this day, that you\u2019re going to get away with it? Kill the bitch, I\u2019m gonna take my time with this one.\u201d Nathan shouts while pointing at you.\n\nNathan at this point spout some sort of gibberish and become blurry and you\u2019re having a hard time focusing on him. It would seem that Sneaks wasn\u2019t entirely correct about none of their number having access to shadow magic.\n\nI\u2019ll deal with the magic asshole, you cut the other one down and then help me!\u201d you shout to Mara.\n\nNathan is moving at a speed that you can barely defend against. He slashes you across the face with his knife, kicks you in the balls and then slams you to the floor. He then punches you multiple times in the face before blinding you completely by stabbing you in both eyes.\n\nYou\u2019re left screaming and bloody on the floor and in darkness when Mara knocks Nathan off of you. Mara has only given you temporary relief since Nathan quickly dispatches her.\n\nYou crawl around on the floor and hear Nathan gloat about what he\u2019s done to you and how he\u2019s going to make you suffer even more, and that\u2019s when you hear a gunshot, followed by the slumping of a body. The gloating has ceased.\n\n\u201cMARA?! MARA?! Are you there!?\u201d you scream out, hoping that she\u2019s still alive.

Between your physical pain and now your emotional pain, you\u2019re a gibbering wreck.\n\nSneaks, without another word reloads his flintlock and shoots you. Whether that\u2019s because he\u2019s a treacherous bastard or whether he was putting you out of your misery, you\u2019ll never know.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter since in those last moments, you wanted to die.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Run", "result": "You immediately make a break for it and the militia is soon in pursuit and shouting for any of their fellows within earshot to help them.\n\nIt\u2019s actually easier than usual to lose the militia since the darkness is more your friend.

You stagger back and fall on your ass. Before you can get up though, two militia men have grabbed you.\n\n\u201cSee? Told you, this one isn\u2019t half as clever as he thinks he is.

He can be dealt with later.\u201d\n\nAnd with those words, you get smashed in the back of the head causing you to go unconscious.\n\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself lying on the dirty smelly floor of a jail cell. Nearby another man sits on a bench with his attention draw towards you now that you\u2019re awake.\n\n\u201cYou okay there friend? When they brought you in last night I thought they were dragging in a corpse. Your head was bloody and you were flat out.\u201d He says.\n\nYou groggily sit up and rub the back of your head which now has dried blood on it. (and so does the floor you just got off of) They really clobbered you a good one. Now you\u2019re just wondering if you\u2019re heading for deeper shit soon.\n\n\u201cSo, what are you in here for?\u201d the man asks.\n\u201cMisunderstanding.\u201d You respond\n\u201cHah, that\u2019s an understatement I\u2019ll bet. Still, those militia bastards will find any excuse to bust someone\u2019s skull open. They got me in here for drunk and disorderly conduct. I\u2019d only had a few drinks and some asshole got in my face so I punched him. Next thing I knew I was getting hauled in here by a couple of militia dicks who just happened to be heading into that tavern for a quick drink. Just my fucking bad luck right?\u201d\n\u201cHm, that\u2019s rough.\u201d You say as you start to get up off the floor and use the cell bars as leverage.\n\u201cI\u2019ll say. But then my luck never has been the best. I think Yag must be perpetually rolling snake eyes for me. I\u2019m probably going to be in more trouble when I get out of here. I was supposed to meet up with my buddies last night. Bah, I guess I\u2019ll just have to deal with the consequences, whatever they may be.\u201d\n\nAs your overly talkative cellmate goes on about his unlucky lot in life, you are more concerned with your own. You are surprised to soon see Captain Branik himself walk down the hallway with a ring of keys in hand. This could be good or bad.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re up. Apologies about the overzealousness of my men last night, but then again they did have to make sure you weren\u2019t up to your usual criminal activity. Especially not when we had a whole ring of criminals to round up and eliminate. You\u2019ll be happy to know that I found all your information to be very helpful. The raid was a complete success.\u201d Branik says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe raid on the Crimson Talon hideout. We went in and laid waste to the place and the criminal scum within it.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you destroyed the Talons last night? As in they\u2019re all dead?\u201d your cellmate asks, eavesdropping on the conversation.\n\u201cOh yes. They all violently resist arrest and there was nothing else to be done, though I imagine most of their crimes would have just gotten them the hanging cages or execution anyway. Probably for the best. Saves time and paperwork.\u201d\n\nCaptain Branik chuckles at his last remark and unlocks your cell door.\n\n\u201cWow. They were the biggest criminal organization in Klyton and had been around for decades. And now they\u2019re all just gone. Guess Yag finally rolled snake eyes for them.\u201d Your cellmate remarks.\n\u201cAre you SURE they\u2019re ALL gone?\u201d you ask Branik, still thinking about the potential repercussions of snitching on them.\n\u201cWorry not snitchy, they\u2019re all fucking dead. We\u2019re very thorough when it comes to cleaning out the filth. Speaking of cleaning out the filth, I suppose you\u2019re free to go now and I\u2019d advise you to leave the city. Consider this your payment for helping out the Klyton militia.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Always my pleasure to help out the men of the law.\u201d You remark leaving the cell.\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to go too, drunky, and you better learn how behave yourself in the future or else you\u2019ll get a stiffer penalty than just getting thrown in a nice cell to dry out in!\u201d Branik says.\n\nYou waste no time in leaving the militia barracks and start pondering your next move. You need to get back to the church to make sure if any of your shit is still there. You fully expect to find that your savings has been ransacked in your absence, but either way from there, you\u2019re leaving this fucking city.\n\nAs you\u2019re walking and thinking a familiar voice pipes up next to you.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m surprised they let either one of us out of there. The militia are usually reluctant to ever let anyone leave their cells unless it\u2019s to go into a hanging cage or a hangman\u2019s rope.\u201d Your former cellmate says.\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cSo, back there, captain asshole said that you gave them information about the Crimson Talons to take them down? Man, that took some big balls to do! There\u2019s no way I could ever do something like that! I\u2019d be way too concerned about one of them killing me for snitching.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, they\u2019re all dead now. No more worries.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. You know what else takes big balls though?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you respond exasperated and wondering why this dickhead is still talking to you.\n\nYou get your answer and quick stab to the side of your neck.\n\n\u201cShanking a snitch bitch in broad daylight only a few steps away from the militia barracks!\u201d he says and runs off before your body even falls to the ground.\n\nYour last moments as you bleed out and gurgle up blood are the sight of slack jawed onlookers watching you die and the shouting of others calling for the militia.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Work together", "result": "Yvette could be right about another one being in the cave.

A boy like you should be careful. These bandits are terrible brutes. They don\u2019t just rob people, they usually kill them too. Sometimes they do even worse things. Why I shudder to think what they\u2019d do to a handsome lad like yourself. You\u2019d find yourself stripped, beaten and violated several times over before they finally slit your throat\u2026and then perhaps violated repeatedly again\u2026I mean who could stop them if they caught you all alone?\u201d\n\u201cNobody I guess.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. But we needn\u2019t dwell on such morbid situations now. You are safe with me and I shall make sure no harm will come to your\u2026body\u2026\u201d\n\nThe merchant licks his lips as he stares at you and it is at this moment you think you now have a general idea of how your sister and Annah must have felt when they had merchants fawning all over them.\n\nFortunately, the merchant doesn\u2019t press whatever unnatural lust he has for you and proceeds to just speak about himself. He mentions his name Graham Oren famous wine merchant (Or at least he thinks he\u2019s famous) and that he\u2019s coming from the Delantium Kingdom to do a bit of business in Holgard. You\u2019re a little disappointed since you were hoping to rip the caravan off in some way, but knowing he\u2019s just hauling wine casks makes stealing those large wooden things a little difficult to do.\n\nHe goes on to say that normally he wouldn\u2019t bother to travel to the doomed city, but sometimes an in person presence is required to appease certain clients.\n\n\u201cDoomed city? Why do you say that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t keep up on politics, m\u2019boy, but then why would someone like you really need to, but yes the city is doomed. The Baron\u2019s days are numbered. Honestly it must only be by Yag\u2019s luck that he\u2019s survived as long as he has.\u201d\n\u201cIs the Delantium Kingdom coming to take back the city?\u201d\n\nGraham looks a little impressed by your basic knowledge of the political landscape.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026it would seem you are just full of surprises and here I was thinking you were just another pretty face. But to answer your question, I do believe they have their sights on it, but not necessarily through force. Something about annexing it peacefully so they don\u2019t have to waste the manpower. Probably through the help of one of his children, but given how treacherous they all are, that\u2019s not necessarily a certainty. Still, whether they take it or not, the Baron himself is going to be out of the picture soon. There is a growing discontent in the air by every faction and everyone that has an agenda there. He can\u2019t possibly keep control for much longer.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s a bit of interesting information about the city, though a bit concerning. You wonder if you\u2019re going to find yourself in the middle of a citywide revolt when you get to Holgard.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering that possibility, Graham begins speaking again.\n\n\u201cBut enough about these things. Let us talk more about you\u2026\u201d Graham says leaning his girth towards you and being bold enough now to put his hand on your leg, which you immediately pull away.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t like being fucking touched and I\u2019m not fucking interested.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be like that. You knew what you were getting into when you entered this carriage.\u201d Graham remarks and tries to touch your leg again.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, don\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll leave? What if I don\u2019t let you?\u201d Graham remarks and then reveals a decorative and strange looking pistol with multiple barrels. Firearms aren\u2019t common and you\u2019ve only ever seen your grandfather\u2019s old non-working troll gun hanging up in your house, but it\u2019s obvious that this fat bastard is rich enough to have some sort of custom made one.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you freeze up, but you maintain a cool head and don\u2019t panic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right little lamb, you\u2019re going to stay right here and\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly a lot of noise and shouting can be heard from outside and one of the mercs rides up to the window.\n\n\u201cSir! Stay inside! We\u2019re being attacked!\u201d he shouts\n\nThis is enough time to distract Graham and allowing you to act.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run out of the carriage", "result": "Only having escape in your mind, you attempt to rush out of the carriage, unfortunately you\u2019re not quite quick enough opening up the door and Graham fires his pistol at you.\n\nYou feel a hot burn on the right side of your head before you tumble out of the carriage. It takes you a moment to actually realize you haven\u2019t suffered a fatal wound, but only a \u201cgraze\u201d that\u2019s taken off your right ear and skin.\n\nYour vision is blurry, you feel dizzy, your head is in pain and ringing and the rest of your body isn\u2019t doing much better since you fell pretty hard and twisted your ankle. To top it all off there is a skirmish going on around you.\n\nYou barely manage to stand yourself up and you nearly fall over several times as you hold your head and try to get out danger. Blood covers one side of your face and you can still feel some of it dripping from the hole where your ear used to be.\n\nWith a muted ring still going on in your head, you don\u2019t hear the sound of a run away horse galloping your way. You\u2019re trampled by the beast and feel the full weight of its hooves stepping on you and crushing some of your ribs in the process.\n\nNow nearly crippled, you don\u2019t even have the strength to get up again, but it hardly matters since one bandit who was sneaking about and trying to avoid the heavier fighting notices that you\u2019re still breathing.\n\nHe of course has no problem in finishing off a target that can\u2019t fight back.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Atack Graham", "result": "You aren\u2019t going to let this fat fuck get a chance to possibly shoot you in the back, plus you\u2019re too pissed about him trying to molest you.\n\nWith a couple quick moves you pull out your dagger, stab him in his arm and relieve him of his fancy pistol. Graham screams out like a little girl and now pleads for his miserable life.\n\n\u201cPlease! No, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d he whimpers pathetically.\n\nOnce again, much like how it was Klint, you show no remorse and pull the trigger of the pistol.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever used one; so the unexpected kickback nearly causes you nearly drop it. You also weren\u2019t expecting it blow half of Graham\u2019s stinking face off. His obese corpse slumps lifelessly against the carriage wall.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d You remark to yourself being in awe of the power of the weapon.\n\nNever being one to miss an opportunity, you quickly deprive Graham\u2019s body of the jeweled rings on his fingers. You then also go through the pockets that you can get to and get a bag full of gold coins.\n\nAfter looting Graham\u2019s body, you remember that there is a skirmish going on outside. A quick glance shows several bandit types fighting the mercs. The mercs are out numbered, but thanks to their armor and better training, they\u2019re doing a good job of fending off the bandits.\n\nYou get out of the carriage with the intent of just running off into the woods, but then you might get lost. It occurs to you that you do have an advantage that will allow you get away a lot faster and still stay on your course.\n\nWhile one of the mounted mercs bashes in the head of a bandit you take the opportunity to shoot him while his back is turned. The merc\u2019s armor is of no protection and he cries out as he falls from his horse.\n\n\u201cWho the hell is that guy?\u201d one of the bandits shouts.\n\u201cDunno, but who cares, he\u2019s killing their side!\u201d another says.\n\nYou quickly run to the now ownerless horse and clumsily get on. You\u2019re a bit vulnerable for a few seconds, but fortunately the bandits seem to now think you\u2019re on their side and don\u2019t focus on you (and the remaining mercs have their hands full)\n\nYou soon manage to control the horse (which is anxious to get away from the chaos anyway) and gallop away until the skirmish is far behind you and you\u2019re basically left alone again. Unfortunately your horse suddenly starts wheeze and wobble. You manage to hastily get off before it collapses.\n\nThere on it\u2019s left side you see what the problem is. In all the ensuing the chaos, the horse actually took a few crossbow bolts. Probably damage to vital organs and its adrenaline is finally wearing off. Bad luck for you and even worse luck for the horse. Not having many more options, you start walking.\n\nIn any case there\u2019s two more bodies to your count now. Granted Graham deserved it, but that merc\u2026well he made a living risking his life, it just happened that today his time was up. You had to survive a dangerous situation and that\u2019s it.\n\nThat\u2019s how you\u2019re justifying that one anyway.\n\nStill, you at least acquired a few goodies for your troubles. You\u2019re going to have to learn more about how to take proper care of this pistol because it\u2019s far too valuable of a weapon to neglect. It\u2019ll certainly make dealing with shit in Holgard a bit more manageable.\n\nThe rings are what surprise you most. You\u2019re no jeweler, but you have stolen enough cheap baubles in the past that you can tell a fake when you examine it in greater detail. The gems in the rings are actually common, but altered slightly (especially their color) to resemble more valuable ones. Even the ring is gold plated rather than pure. Looks like Graham wasn\u2019t as rich as he made out.\n\nHowever, the little pouch of coins is real money so there\u2019s that at least.\n\nYou continue along the road, which as you guessed starts alternating from being intact, to dirt with a few stones to being little more than a well worn path in the grass. Even the occasional signs aren\u2019t much help given that many are flat out damaged in some way.\n\nYour natural instinct to just keep going in a straight line like you were doing, but unfortunately for you, the path completely disappears into forest. Doesn\u2019t help that the road also branches into several paths that twist in different directions. You weren\u2019t expecting that so you aren\u2019t sure which way to go.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering this decision, a voice calls out to you.\n\n\u201cHey! Where youz tryin\u2019 to get to?\u201d\n\nYou then see a person dressed in simple clothing coming out of the forest. He\u2019s a little shorter than you, in fact he\u2019s a little greener than you too. Doesn\u2019t look like an orc though, not nearly big or massive enough. Goblin perhaps, but he\u2019s taller than one and almost a bit human looking. A short green human with a few warts on his face and a bigger than average nose.\n\nIn any case, you maintain your usual caution.\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s far enough. Who are you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m just Warts.\u201d He answers picking his big nose.\n\u201cAppropriate name.\u201d\n\u201cGrhm. So youz tryin\u2019 to get to Holgard?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, why?\u201d\n\u201cWell cuz, I can lead you to it. Lotz o\u2019 paths in this forest lead lotz o\u2019 places. Easy to get lost if you don\u2019t know da way.\u201d\n\u201cYou know the way huh? How do I know you aren\u2019t going to lead me into an ambush?\u201d\n\u201cYouz don\u2019t I suppoze. Take yer chances going alone an\u2019 getting lost, don\u2019t care. I just try to earn a little extra coin for drink an\u2019 leadin\u2019 clueless humies like yerself gets me some\u2026well when they aren\u2019t throwin\u2019 rocks at me that is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? What you mean?\u201d Warts replies.\n\u201cI mean, you don\u2019t look quite like any greenskin I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cYou seen a lot o them have ya?\u201d\n\u201cWell no, but I\u2019ve heard tales\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t really know nuthin\u2019 then do ya?\u201d Warts says in a perturbed tone.\n\nActually he\u2019s got a bit of a point.\n\nYou decide to get right to the matter.\n\n\u201cAlright, assuming I take you up on your generous offer, how much is it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, yeah price\u2026hmm, you want to go to Holgard right? Five gold coins.\u201d Warts answers.\n\u201cFive gold coins just to lead me through the forest? That\u2019s fucking outrageous!\u201d\n\u201cHolgard is tricky to get to if you don\u2019t know the way. Lot of false paths get made. Besides, you lot usually have more than enough gold. I see you humies travelling all over in your rolly boxes filled with goods.\u201d\n\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in a rolly box carting around a wagon full of treasures? I\u2019m just a simple traveller down on his luck.\u201d\n\u201cDown on luck huh? You should pray to Yag more. Anywayz five gold. Final offer.\u201d\n\nThis greenskin obviously has no concept of haggling. It really isn\u2019t like you don\u2019t have the coin, it\u2019s more like you don\u2019t want to give so much to the likes of him after being fortunate enough to acquire it in the first place.\n\nUltimately, he\u2019s either telling the truth about the forest being that treacherous or he\u2019s completely bullshitting you. You\u2019ll just have to decide for yourself.", "action_results": [{"action": "Pay Warts", "result": "He might be bullshitting you, but you\u2019re not exactly familiar with this area, so you might as well not take chances. Still, you got a better idea on payment.\n\n\u201cHey Warts, I don\u2019t have the five gold coins, but I do have these.\u201d You say and hold out Graham\u2019s rings to Warts.\n\nWarts approaches cautiously and then takes one of the rings from your hand. He inspects it and then speaks.\n\n\u201cGrm. Okay, sure these will do. Stupid hobgoblin tribe around here always likes pretty jewelry even if it fakesy.\u201d He says and takes the other one from your hand.\n\u201cFake?\u201d you say in a completely surprised tone, though not completely put on since you didn\u2019t think someone like Warts would know.\n\u201cYeah, fake\u2026 youz really didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I come from a small town and don\u2019t have a good eye for that sort of thing. The merchant passing through was very convincing when he was selling them. I bought them for a girl I liked, but alas, I was unlucky in love too, so I just kept them.\u201d\n\u201cGrm. Youz gotta have a better eye and pray to Yag more. Anywayz, come on let\u2019s get goin, don\u2019t wanna stand out here tooz long. Dis path is da one.\u201d\n\nYou start following Warts who leads the way.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026there are hobgoblins in this area?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yeah, the Spider Fang tribe, but there don\u2019t really come around the way we\u2019re goin\u2019 so no need to worry about getting\u2019 eaten. Can\u2019t wait to get back to them though. With these rings, Snuffit will allow me at least ten ruts with \u2018er. Way better than getting\u2019 drunk\u2026well sometimes better anyway.\u201d Warts remarks.\n\u201cAre you a member of the Spider Fangs?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Nah\u2026too much humie blood. Can\u2019t ever be part of tribe proper. Good thing mum good fighter and loves me, otherwise tribe probably would \u2018ave eaten me when I was born.\u201d\n\u201cWait, your mom is a hobgoblin? Who was your father then?\u201d\n\u201cDunno, some humie bandit that attacked and tried to rut with her in the forest. Me mum said it was dark and he seemed pretty surprised when he realized she wasn\u2019t another human. Mentioned he tasted like cheap beer after she was done wit him, so I guess he liked to drink.\u201d\n\nSince you have no words for that story, you just silently continue to follow.\n\nWarts and you trudge along a dirt path for quite sometime until it disappears completely.\n\n\u201cOkay, from here, we go\u2026dis way\u2026no wait dis way\u2026I think\u2026\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cYou think? Don\u2019t you know?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I just haven\u2019t used this way in a long time. Gotta pass a haunted cabin. Accidently passed out there once, ended up shitting my good pants, though not sure if that was just because of the ghost.\u201d\n\u201cHaunted cabin? Why the hell are we going near it then?\u201d\n\u201cCause it\u2019s the safest way. Even the bandit types don\u2019t like goin\u2019 near it and nobody from the Spider Fang tribe is brave enough either. Sides, it\u2019s really only haunted sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes? But what if today is that day?\u201d\n\u201cWell hope youz brought extra pants den. Really though, it\u2019s a lot safer. Da ghost really only messes with people that go in that cabin. I mean if you wanna risk it, we could go another way I know, but there\u2019s been a lotta bandits travelling back an through that area. Normally, I\u2019d just go that way since I know all da best hidin\u2019 places and even if they did see me, I\u2019d disappear again before they could even mount an attack. However you\u2019re probably not as stealthy as me, so you\u2019d probably get yerself seen and gutted. Might even rut wit youz first, some of these bandits aren\u2019t picky.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually no stranger to being stealthy myself when I have to be.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? Grm. Well it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather take my chances sneaking pass some bandits than possibly dealing with something I can\u2019t even hurt.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, hope yer as sneaky as you claim, cuz all bets are off if the bandits catch sight of ya. Dis way.\u201d\n\nOnce again Warts leads the way and you follow.\n\nYou trudge through the forest for quite sometime and eventually it gets dark, but you still haven\u2019t seen any signs of bandits or anyone else really. Warts doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned, but you\u2019re constantly alert, thinking behind every tree lies an ambush.\n\n\u201cGettin\u2019 pitch black, gonna have to stop soon.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cWhat? We\u2019re not walking through the night? In fact won\u2019t it be easier to slip by any potential hostiles in the dark?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou want to continue, be my guest, but I\u2019m gonna get some sleep. I\u2019m tired. Sides, looks like we got lucky. Guess the bandit crew that was wandering around this area moved on. Praise Yag.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d You reply, still looking around.\n\nWhile you\u2019re half tempted to go on without Warts, you\u2019re still holding on to the slight hope that he actually knows where he\u2019s going, so you start looking for a tree to climb and sleep in.\n\n\u201cHey, what youz doin? You think youz a squirrel or somethin\u2019?\u201d Warts asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping down here on the ground. What if something wanders by before I can properly react? I\u2019ll be in a tree so I can at least be somewhat out of immediate sight.\u201d\n\u201cYouz gonna fall out and break yo\u2019 neck too. All youz gotta do is cover yerself in dirt and leaves and shit. Hides youz just fine.\u201d Warts says and begins doing just that.\n\u201cYeah well when you\u2019re already green and smell like the outdoors, I suppose it\u2019s a lot easier to camouflage yourself with little effort. I\u2019ll take my chances in a high tree.\u201d\n\nWarts shakes his head unconvinced and continues to cover himself. You have to admit, if you didn\u2019t know he was there, you probably wouldn\u2019t notice him if you were just wandering by.\n\nAs for you, you climb to a sturdy and large enough branch that will support your weight and you can at least somewhat perch yourself on. You already know you aren\u2019t going to sleep deep tonight, but you figure that\u2019s sort of been the standard problem while out here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be so damn glad to be out of the damn wilderness.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re up for quite awhile, but hear nothing except the usual sounds of various insects, owls and other nocturnal animals. Eventually sleep catches up with you and you close your eyes.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure how long you\u2019re asleep, but you open your eyes when you start hearing voices nearby.\n\n\u201cI told ya, I heard something.\u201d\n\u201cProbably just another raccoon. I don\u2019t know why we gotta patrol over here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cCause the boss said so that\u2019s why! You know there are savage greenskins that live in this forest. We\u2019re supposed to make sure none of them get too close to the main cam\u2026I knew it. I knew I heard something! Snoring! And it\u2019s coming from over there!\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re awake enough to see everything that\u2019s going on below. You see two men who you guess are bandits.\n\nSeems like Warts didn\u2019t take into account that his camouflage attempt would all be for naught due to his large honker making noise. It doesn\u2019t take long before they kick and prod at his hidden location, waking him up.\n\n\u201cHah! A filthy greenskin! Probably a scout! Kill him!\u201d one of the bandits shouts.\n\nWarts just barely avoids their attacks and tries to scramble away from his prone position, but one of the bandits manages to trip him up before he can run and it isn\u2019t looking good as he gets kicked in the face by the other one.\n\nNot that you have any loyalty to Warts and he\u2019s been pretty snarky towards you in general, but he\u2019s still your guide and if you don\u2019t want to get lost\u2026\n\nYou waste no time and try to climb down your tree as fast as you can. Fortunately, the bandits are have decided to have a little fun before killing him directly. They proceed to continue kicking Warts and don\u2019t notice you at all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot the bandits", "result": "One thing you\u2019ve learned since acquiring your new weapon is how easy it kills folks with minimal effort on your part.\n\nYou shoot one of the bandits in the back before anyone knows what\u2019s going on. He falls to the ground screaming out in pain. He isn\u2019t dead yet, but he might as well be.\n\nThe other bandit at this point has turned around and raised his arms though still holding on to his weapon.\n\n\u201cShit. Okay\u2026look this ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to do with you son. So why don\u2019t you put that thing away and\u2026ARGH!\u201d\n\nWarts has wasted no time and already cut into back the bandit\u2019s legs. The bandit falls and you kick away his dropped weapon while Warts proceeds to crawl on the bandit\u2019s back and repeatedly stab the hell out of him.\n\nMeanwhile you go over the other incapacitated bandit and finish him off by slitting his throat. By the time you\u2019ve done that, Warts has already finished off the other one.\n\n\u201cQuick let\u2019s loot the bodies and get outta here. All that noise your shooty gun made might have attracted something else!\u201d Warts exclaims.\n\nThe bandit you killed doesn\u2019t really have anything of value on him, though you do take his short sword since one can never have too many weapons. After that\u2019s done, Warts tells you to follow him and the pair of you are off again.\n\nYou keep up the brisk pace for the remainder of the night, which soon starts turning to day again. You also can now see a break in the trees. You\u2019ve finally reached the end of this blasted forest and a large walled city is now in sight!\n\n\u201cSee? Told ya I\u2019d get ya to Holgard.\u201d Warts proudly remarks.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been getting me anywhere if I hadn\u2019t saved your life a few moments ago.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBah\u2026if youz let me die, you woulda been lost.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but you would have been still dead.\u201d\n\u201cGrh. Well\u2026maybe I do owe ya some thanks\u2026I\u2019m not given back these rings you paid me with though!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect you to. Just wanted you to remember that I saved your ass.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay\u2026anyway, the main road\u2019s over that way. I trust youz can make it from here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Oh, word of advice, don\u2019t go flashin\u2019 dat shooty around unless you\u2019re gonna use it. The guards don\u2019t take kindly to folks just carrying those things around.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t I just bribe them to look the other way?\u201d\n\u201cSure, but unless you\u2019re someone of importance, or have connections or something, they\u2019ll probably just take it from youz anyway. \u2018Specially with as fancy as that one you got is. Never seen one like yers before. Youz not really a down on your luck traveller from a small town are you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am from a small town, but I may have had a little more fortune than I let on when we first met. Not much more though.\u201d\n\u201cGrm, well lyin\u2019 will serve you well in Holgard. The city has a lotz o\u2019 opportunities, for someone like you.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, youz stealthy, youz a liar and I saw ya kill someone without hesitation. Youz no doubt a rogue, possibly even an assassin, but you seem a little young to have been one of those for very long. In any case, you\u2019ll be able to hone whatever skill you do have. Just don\u2019t piss off the Ebony Claw Syndicate in the process.\u201d\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d\n\u201cThey run the underworld of Holgard, though I think they\u2019re still trying to stamp out a few other lingering organizations. They don\u2019t much care for freelancer types either. I guess you could try to join them, but don\u2019t ask me how, I\u2019m not familiar with their initiation practices.\u201d\n\u201cAny suggestions on where to go first when I get to the city?\u201d\n\u201cUm, the Hell\u2019s Own Inn might be good for the likes of you. Despite its name, it\u2019s fairly safe. Sort of neutral ground too, so youz won\u2019t be stompin\u2019 around in someone\u2019s territory.\u201d\n\nWith that last bit of advice, Warts says he\u2019s heading off to see Snuffit and the two of you part company.\n\nYou follow the road to Holgard and of course when you get to the city gates you get stopped.\n\n\u201cSorry friend, but we can\u2019t just let anyone in this fine city. Well not before checking you first.\u201d The guard says with a smirk.\n\u201cSure, I understand\u2026just let me\u2026whoops.\u201d You say and drop a few of your gold coins on the ground. The guard slowly picks one up.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, I think we can dispense with the check. You look like an okay lad. Off you go.\u201d He says and finishes picking up the rest of your coins.\n\nYou didn\u2019t really want to let go of your coin like that, but you couldn\u2019t risk being searched. You\u2019re just glad he wasn\u2019t a greedy asshole.\n\nWell you\u2019ve finally reached your destination and you now have an entire city of corruption to perform your work in. First thing you\u2019re going to do though is find that inn Warts mentioned. You\u2019d really like to sleep in a proper bed if only for a little while, then you can take it from there.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take you long to find the place; it isn\u2019t even in too bad of an area. When you enter a few people watch you, but don\u2019t say anything. The burly looking innkeeper just asks you what you want and when you say a room for a day, he asks for payment, which you hand to him in exchange for a key.\n\nThe room isn\u2019t the same luxury you had back home, but it isn\u2019t bad considering the price. Between this room and the recent bribe however, you realize you\u2019re going to have to start getting to work fairly soon because your money is already starting to run low.\n\nYou sort of wonder if maybe you should seek out some sort of connection to see about joining the Ebony Claws, but then you figure you should probably get to know the city first before joining anyone.\n\nNot to mention that while you get the idea that this Ebony Claw Syndicate is the big swingin\u2019 dick around here, you\u2019re not really keen on the whole idea of having to \u201cwork\u201d for someone else.\n\nThe whole point of being a rogue was so you didn\u2019t HAVE to get a real job and have a boss in the first place! If you get wrapped up in an organization like the Ebony Claws, you\u2019re also likely to be in it \u201cfor life\u201d and that\u2019s a bit too much commitment for you.\n\nNo, the best thing to do is to keep a low profile and make your own way for now.\n\nIt\u2019s a big city and you\u2019re ready to take what you can. (And not draw any unwanted attention in the process)", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 2D: Unwanted Attention\n\n\nYear 17\n\nThis city is a violent crime ridden pit of corruption.\n\nAnd while you don\u2019t actually mind all that, what you do wish is that you didn\u2019t have to concern yourself with potentially stumbling into Ebony Claw Syndicate territory, which according to most of them is basically the entire city. They\u2019re more of a danger than the Holgard Watch.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Thieves\u2019 Guild, which is the ECS chief rival from what you\u2019ve learned. Apparently the Thieves Guild was established here first, but when the ECS moved in with their Blue Dream trade, they\u2019ve been slowly winning the fight over the underworld\n\nOriginally, the Guild was more of a loose confederation of thieves and such. Nobody ever forced anyone to join, but there were benefits if you did such as not having to worry about paying extra for fencing stolen goods, ease of bribing guards for major crimes, etc.\n\nAs the Thieves\u2019 Guild has been losing ground however, they\u2019ve been less \u201cfree spirited\u201d and have been actively trying to recruit any freelance thief, burglar, pick pocket they can. However, they\u2019re more reasonable about it than the ECS since they still don\u2019t force you to join and will let you remain independent. As opposed to the ECs who normally just beat the hell out of any freelancers as a warning once and if they get caught again, it ends much worse.\n\nThere are a few other smaller factions, but they\u2019re so low that they\u2019re barely worth considering.\n\nFortunately so far you\u2019ve managed to avoid the attention of any group mainly due to focusing on stealing actual coin and dealing primarily with a non-aligned fence by the name of Yinen for your stolen valuables. You met him at the Hell\u2019s Own Inn where you still reside at. Funny thing is you didn\u2019t seek him out; he came to you asking if you needed a fence.\n\nAfter a bit of suspicion and getting over some trust issues (Which you still have concerning him) you agreed and he\u2019s been taking all your business. You aren\u2019t sure who he\u2019s selling your stolen goods to and he\u2019s probably taking a little more than he should, but it\u2019s worth it just so you don\u2019t have to worry about selling the stuff yourself or seeking one out and having to get involved with one of the major factions in the city.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019ve been more or less making a decent living here and despite a healthy amount of paranoia, you actually like it here. It\u2019s definitely not Teckleville.\n\n\u201cYeah, these will fetch you a nice price. Might take a few days though. You alright with waiting?\u201d Yinen remarks examining your gems.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine. Just get me the value in bullets and a pistol cleaning kit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Okay, sure. But more bullets again? Are you planning to shoot everyone in Holgard? I didn\u2019t realize you used it so much, I would think such a loud weapon would incur too much noise in your profession.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t use it much actually, but it makes me feel safe.\u201d\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t argue with that. Things in this city have been feeling a little more tense than usual. Rumors are that there are dark forces gathering to stage a coup on the Baron.\u201d\n\u201cDark forces? What, as opposed to the dark forces under the Baron\u2019s control?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I mean like REAL dark forces. There\u2019s just rumors about religion being involved, it\u2019s very weird.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you mean like Fel, the god of shadows? You told me their temple has ties to the ECS. You saying the Ebony Claw Syndicate is going to take over the city directly?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s them we should worry about. Tell me, have you ever heard of Neroth?\u201d\n\u201cNot really religious so no.\u201d\n\u201cNot surprised, most people don\u2019t unless they\u2019re really into the old text dedicated to Joachim. You familiar with him right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s general a religion that preaches peace and shit.\u201d\n\u201cWell there was a time when it didn\u2019t and that\u2019s mainly due to Neroth. Neroth was like the opposite of Joachim. Good verses evil type shit. People forget that it was only a couple hundred years ago when the Church of Joachim was burning and crusading on a regular basis due to their desire to stomp out any followers of Neroth and things they generally tied to him such as the supernatural. Nowadays the Joachimites are generally peace loving pacifists for the most part, but that\u2019s only due being mostly successful in destroying those that follow Neroth and then subsequently going so overboard that some of the Joachimites finally realized they needed to rein it in before they became like their hated enemies.\u201d\n\u201cHm, didn\u2019t realize you were a theologian. How do you know all this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cEh, I grew up in a Joachim household. Didn\u2019t take obviously, but still I don\u2019t like hearing rumors of Neroth worshippers being in the city. I mean say what you want about Karn or even Fel, but they aren\u2019t actively evil deities. Neroth is bad news man.\u201d\n\nBefore you can respond you\u2019re suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cBah, none of doze gods compare to Yag. No point worrying about shit, when you\u2019ve run outta luck, yer time iz up and that\u2019s all there iz to it.\u201d\n\nYou look and see Warts standing nearby clutching something in his hand. Looks like a bunch of small figurines of some sort.\n\n\u201cWarts? What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSellin these figures. Found \u2018em in da woods with a bunch of broken boxes. Probably somethin off a Caravan that bandits were tryin to steal from. Dunno why dey didn\u2019t take these. Tried to use dem for barter with Spiderfangs, but dey dumb. Think these things iz cursed. Superstitious idjits.\u201d Warts remarks and hands five figurines to Yinen who takes them.\n\n\u201cHmm, odd. They look like something that you\u2019d find in some tribal village. I\u2019d say Sotakian, but these don\u2019t look reptilian enough and I\u2019ve never known the lizards to have craft stuff out of valuable material. You got Ivory, jade, gold, silver and platinum here. Wonder if they\u2019re a complete set. Well I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find someone interested.\u201d\n\nYinen hands Warts a bag of coins, which Warts takes and then looks displeased about.\n\n\u201cEy! Wat\u2019s dis then? I may be just some dumb halfbreed hobgob, but I know damn well that shit is worth more!\u201d Warts exclaims.\n\u201cI gave you MORE than enough Warts. I still have find someone interested in this shit as you put it.\u201d Yinen remarks.\n\u201cBah, you humies always tryin\u2019 ta cheat. Fine. Should be enuff for drink and Snuffit for awhile anyways.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave to head up to your room, you figure you\u2019ll stay in a couple days waiting for Yinen\u2019s payment. You\u2019ve got enough to take a break for a while.\n\nAs you\u2019re half way to your room, you hear the patter of feet running behind you and you quickly turn around with your pistol.\n\n\u201cEY! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cWarts, what the hell, you should know better than to run up on me like that! Why are you following me anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted ta catch ya before I left. I noze I still owez youz a debt, well I\u2019m here ta repay.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I wuz thinkin\u2019 I could help ya on a job or sumthin.\u201d\n\u201cHelp? No I don\u2019t think so. I work alone.\u201d\n\u201cAn howzat workin\u2019 out? Doesn\u2019t look like yer doin\u2019 all that well if yer still livin\u2019 here. If I had ta guess, youz still small time.\u201d\n\u201cI do alright halfbreed, and what\u2019s it to you anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019 you could be doin\u2019 better if you went fer better targets. Have you even broken into one of dem nobles\u2019 homes yet?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no\u2026but I\u2019m working up to it.\u201d\n\u201cPfft. Wat kinda thief are ya?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve cased the high class rich area several times and the homes got security up the ass. The aristocrats got more watchmen on their payroll than the average merchant. I know I\u2019m no slouch, but if I can get enough coin with lower risk targets, why take the fucking chance? Besides, I\u2019m trying to keep a low profile anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell what about Lord Reginald?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, youz been in dis city for a year and you don\u2019t even know the major players! Lord Reginald is some well off guy dat got a title becuz he\u2019s dah Baron\u2019s son\u2019s friend. Hear he\u2019s more than dat though.\u201d\n\u201cYeah so what\u2019s this all got to do with me?\u201d\n\u201cWell he lives more on the edge of da high end district. He doesn\u2019t even own a mansion, just a modest house. He has no family an\u2019 he also doesn\u2019t pay for any extra guards. Not even mercs, which prolly means he\u2019s got more coin than it appears\u201d\n\u201cThere has to be a catch. I mean if he\u2019s well off and a special friend of the Baron\u2019s son, then he\u2019s gotta have connections and protection.\u201d\n\u201cWell, dere\u2019s some rumors about him and not just about him pokin\u2019 the Baron\u2019s son like a woman. Like he\u2019s got magic powers or sumthin\u2019. Guess makes sense he don\u2019t need extra help.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we should got rob a wizard.\u201d\n\u201cNah, he\u2019s no wizard, he\u2019s just got some magic powers. Prolly just rumors anyway. Sides, should be easiest stealin\u2019 from one lone man, than one who has a shitload of guards right?\u201d\n\u201cA lone man, who might be able to turn me into ash with a flick of a finger and has who knows whatever else in his home. Assuming I even go for this, why do I need you to come along again? I didn\u2019t realize you were actually a thief, figured you were more of an opportunistic scavenger.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I\u2019ve been sneakin\u2019 around, nicking stuff long before youz was even thought about! You try growin up as a half breed in a mostly hostile tribe. I had ta steal to survive sometimes! Sides I could carry more stuff for ya! Also, if ya getz inta trouble I could help. Like last time!\u201d\n\u201cLast time I helped YOU.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m offerin\u2019 anyway. I don\u2019t even want dat big of a cut\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd THERE it is. Warts definitely isn\u2019t doing this solely for altruistic reasons.\n\n\u201cThought you said you were helping me out?\u201d\n\u201cI am! You don\u2019t expect me to do it fer free do ya? Come on, give a hob halfbreed a break. The place is ripe fer the pluckin\u2019 an best of all ya don\u2019t have ta worry if its Ebony Claw territory.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head that you\u2019re considering this.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, we can go do this, but I\u2019m getting some rest first, just tell me where the place is exactly and I\u2019ll meet you there later. When is the best time to break into this place anyway?\u201d\n\nWarts gives you some directions and then says it probably would be best to meet him there around midnight since he says he\u2019s seen this Reginald person leave at night and stay out until dawn. Sounds more like something you do, but if he\u2019s not going to be there then that\u2019s when you need to be there.\n\nYou part ways with Warts and get some sleep.\n\nHours pass and when you wake up you find that it\u2019s night time, still too early though. You stay your room a bit going over all your tools and equipment and making sure everything is in order. Eventually you decide that you\u2019re going to be as ready as you\u2019re going to be and leave.\n\nYou head downstairs and find that the inn has the usual crowd with one important difference.\n\nYou see Warts lying under a table with a couple of big mugs of alcohol on it. Surprisingly, the owner has not thrown him out; unsurprisingly everyone is avoiding that table.\n\nYou walk over to the halfbreed and kick him in the foot, which causes him to stir, so he\u2019s not completely out of it.\n\n\u201cWarts! What the hell are you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? I\u2026uh\u2026buh\u2026I waz just\u2026\u201d Warts slurs as he sits up and just manages to not hit his head on the table.\n\n\u201cYou were just what? What were you doing Warts? Fixing the table leg? Counting the number of nails in the wood? Having an out of body experience and travelling a different plane of existence? You talked me into doing this job and now I find you in no condition to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cEy! I\u2019m up! I\u2019m up! I ain\u2019t forgot wat we\u2019re supposed ta do, an\u2019 I\u2019m more than ready! I\u2019m not drunk, I just had a little rest like you did.\u201d\n\nYou have your doubts about that, though Warts stands up without too much trouble.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take Warts with you", "result": "You might as well go together at this point, you knew he wasn\u2019t going to be the ideal partner to begin with. Who knows, maybe you can use him as bait or something.\n\n\u201cAlright, come on let\u2019s go.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHold on a minute.\u201d Warts says and finishes off one of the mugs that wasn\u2019t quite empty yet.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m thirsty. Alright NOW let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nWarts and you leave the inn and after looking around a bit and scratching his head he beckons you to follow him. He walking just fine, so maybe he isn\u2019t that bad off.\n\nYou continue to follow without another word, until he gets to a secluded spot with a sewer covering.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? You ask.\n\u201cTryin\u2019 to take dis thing off, wat\u2019s it look like ya idjit? Help me over here.\u201d Warts says trying to take off the sewer lid.\n\u201cNo, I mean why the fuck are we entering the sewers?\u201d\n\u201cCuz, it\u2019s the best way to get into Reginald\u2019s house. He\u2019s got a secret passage to it down here.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell you know this?\u201d\n\u201cCuz people talk shit all the time and not even realize ol\u2019 Warts is even there to lissen. Waz in a garbage bin and heard these two weird guys in red robes talkin about it in an alley awhile back.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026okay I\u2019m not even going to ask why the hell you were in a garbage bin, but weird guys in red robes, secret passages\u2026are you sure Reginald isn\u2019t part of some fucking cult? I mean this is starting to sound a lot more complicated and dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why ya think I wanted someone else to come along?\u201d\n\u201cYOU said this was for MY benefit!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026well it is! Look humie, ya gotta take big risks in dis profession. I don\u2019t doubt yer skilled. You\u2019ve lasted longer than most independently in dis city. But I\u2019m tellin ya, there\u2019s more out there that yer missin. I mean, sure it\u2019s foolish ta go head to head against da ECS, but robbin some rich asshole that may or may not be a wizard? Well dat\u2019s different.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see how since both can get you killed. However, I do see your point to a small degree. I have been playing it a bit on the safe side. Still, if this is looking to be more trouble than it\u2019s worth then I\u2019m getting the hell out as quick as possible.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a plan ta me.\u201d\n\nYou help Warts with the sewer covering and the pair of you descend into the smelly depths.\n\nIt actually isn\u2019t too bad, but that might be because you\u2019re standing next to Warts and his own stench is cancelling out that of the sewers.\n\nWarts gets slightly more talkative as you walk to your destination. He mentions that the Thieves Guild has their hideout somewhere down here, but he doesn\u2019t know where. Neither does the ECS, since they\u2019d probably mount an attack if they could.\n\nWarts also goes on about how he\u2019s not fond of the ECS since a lot of them tend to have ties to Fel while he\u2019s dedicated to Yag. Says that worshipping Fel if you\u2019re a thief is like cheating since he\u2019s the god of shadows and all. Though he\u2019s not so much opposed to that, so much as he doesn\u2019t like all the dedication Fel seems to want. Yag on the other hand doesn\u2019t really require anything and he not might bless you anyway, but then he might give you a lot even if you don\u2019t do much. Warts claims that ALL the gods are like that, so he might as well pray to one that is at least honest about it all.\n\n\u201cWhy worship any god at all?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWat? You crazy or sumthin? You don\u2019t pick a god, youz gonna be in trouble when ya die! Even pickin\u2019 some stupid god like Karn would be better than nuthin! You don\u2019t believe in anything an\u2019 who knows WHERE yer soul goes! Nah, better to pick somethin\u2019 just in case.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little surprising just how serious Warts takes religion, well as serious as a follower to the God of Luck and Chance can be anyway.\n\n(It also occurs to you how it\u2019s weird how everyone\u2019s been getting religious on you lately)\n\n\u201cEh, I guess I can sort of see that logic. I\u2019m not really religious, but occasionally I have said the odd thanks to Yag.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all ya need man. He\u2019s lissening, even if he doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Warts says.\n\nYou and Warts continue a little longer and then he stops.\n\n\u201cOkay, think wez gettin\u2019 close. Should be a secret wall around here from what I heard.\u201d Warts says and begins pushing on the wall nearby.\n\u201cThis seems a bit unprotected.\u201d You say looking around for potential traps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret door, maybe he didn\u2019t anticipate anyone finding it.\u201d\n\u201cYou said the Thieves Guild is down here, surely they would have found it if this is their territory.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big ass sewer and they\u2019re the Thieves Guild not the Holgard Watch. Dey don\u2019t exactly patrol da place. They\u2019re all most likely up top breaking into shit. Besides, I told ya, they ain\u2019t the ECS. They aren\u2019t very territorial anyway. Dat\u2019s why we can walk around here without as much concern\u2026well except for giant rats and such.\u201d\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to ask Warts another question about the Thieves\u2019 Guild, Warts finds what you\u2019re looking for and when he does so a large bolt just whizzes over his head and into the wall behind him.\n\n\u201cMan, good thing Yag lissened to me.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cGood thing you\u2019re short and constantly walk around slightly hunched over most of the time. Oddly, this makes me feel slightly better. If there weren\u2019t any traps at all I\u2019d be even more paranoid about how easy this was. So far it seems like this guy just has shitty security, but then we haven\u2019t actually gone inside yet.\u201d You respond.\n\nYou and Warts both enter the passage and soon find yourself in a cellar with a bunch of wine barrels. Tons of them. Warts looks like he\u2019s hit a gold mine and immediately starts grabbing wine bottles.\n\n\u201cHey, leave some room for actual valuable, you\u2019re supposed to be carrying shit for me, remember?\u201d\n\u201cI am grabbing valuables! You realize how much old bottles of wine go fer?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, point taken, just don\u2019t drink them all.\u201d\n\nWhile Warts plays wine expert, you take a look around the room and find that there are stairs leading up and a solid metal door to your left, which is locked.\n\nSince you don\u2019t want to go too far from Warts while he\u2019s alone with a bunch of wine, you stay in the cellar and pick the lock of the metal door, which is surprisingly easy.\n\nYou enter the dimly lit room and find what could only be a room dedicated to dark magical endeavors of some sort. There\u2019s two demonic looking idols starring at you and the pentagrams and symbols on the floor aren\u2019t any you recognize. There\u2019s also blood splatters on them.\n\nFrom what little you now know of this Reginald, this guy is into some dark shit. Everything about this makes you want to just get the hell out right now, but you\u2019re already here now and you\u2019d hate to just leave with wine bottles.\n\nYou walk carefully around the room making sure you don\u2019t step on any symbols or inside any circles just in case. You also keep an eye on the demonic idols, which still feel like they\u2019re watching you.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much else in the room itself, though there is another door off to the side, this one isn\u2019t locked and you open it.\n\nHowever, you soon wish you hadn\u2019t.\n\nYou see a row of cages and various torture devices along with dead bodies in most of them.\n\n\u201cFucking hell, I came here to rob some shit, not take a tour of a slaughterhouse.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to shut the door a voice calls out.\n\n\u201cStranger! You\u2019re not one of them! Not one those red robed freaks! (sob) Please! Help me! I can\u2019t die here, not like this! I watched my\u2026(choke) just please\u2026help. Who knows when they\u2019ll be back!\u201d a nearly naked young girl in a cage begs. She reaches out to you desperately hoping that you\u2019ll rescue her.\n\nYou definitely didn\u2019t sign up for this\u2026however given what you\u2019ve seen here, you\u2019d be quite the heartless dick if you just left her here to this horrible fate.\n\n\u201cCurse my parents for some of their morality getting through\u2026\u201d you say and head over to the cage.\n\nThe lock isn\u2019t that difficult to pick and you soon get it open causing the girl to not even wait around, she just runs past you, out the torture room and beyond. You suppose you can understand her not wanting to stick around, but a thank you would have been nice.\n\nSo much for good deeds.\n\nSeeing as there isn\u2019t anything else in here, you return to the wine room where you unsurprisingly see Warts drinking.\n\n\u201cHey, some humie gal just ran through here an into da sewers wearin\u2019 practically nuthin\u2019.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cYeah and I\u2019m glad to see that didn\u2019t interrupt your important work. Thought you were supposed to be helping.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWat\u2019s yer problem? I am helpin\u2019! Sides dese valuable bottles, I found out one of the barrels had a hollowish sound. Smashed it open and there was a body inside, idiots didn\u2019t bother looting it and he had some good stuff still on him.\u201d Warts answers and takes another swig from a bottle.\n\u201cWarts, you\u2019re telling me you found a body in one of these barrels and you\u2019re STILL drinking the fucking wine?\u201d\n\nWarts suddenly stops drinking. He ponders your words a bit and then sniffs the top of the bottle. Then he promptly gives a little shrug.\n\n\u201cStill tastes alright ta me.\u201d Warts says\n\u201cOf course it does. Look, we\u2019re getting the hell out of here. This place has been a big fat zero.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat about all these valuable bottles of wine? An\u2019 ya haven\u2019t even checked da upstairs yet!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019ve checked enough of the basement to know that most likely there isn\u2019t going to be anything that precious up there that\u2019s going to make me want to stay another moment in this fucking house. There\u2019s some dark magic going on here and I\u2019m not sticking around for it rub off on me.\u201d\n\u201cJust say a prayer ta Yag, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as you like to point out, he might not listen.\u201d\n\u201cFine, we can leave if you really wants, but I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 we haven\u2019t gone through the entire house yet.\u201d\n\nFunny how Warts is content on letting you do all the exploration. He could have easily been searching the upstairs while you were stumbling upon sacrificial captives.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave now", "result": "Warts can stay and get drunk here if he wants, but you\u2019re not sticking around. You\u2019re also not leaving without something for your trouble, you take Wart\u2019s pack on a table stuffed with bottles and leave.\n\n\u201cEy! Dat\u2019s my shit!\u201d Warts shouts and immediately begins to follow you.\n\nYou make your way back through the sewers as quick as you can, while Warts is complaining.\n\n\u201cLook, I knows ya didn\u2019t wanna stick around, but some of dose bottles is my cut!\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you drank more than your cut back at the house! Besides, you told me you looted some body you found in one of the barrels, I\u2019d say you came out ahead.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cAlright, alright, but can ya at least gimme my pack back?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it back to you when we get to safety, staying around here is just not a good idea\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nYou suddenly hear the sounds of multiple footsteps heading your direction and you immediately find an alcove to hide in and pull out your pistol. Warts of course crowds your hiding spot, you just hope the smell of the sewers masks his own odor from whoever is approaching.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just one either, it\u2019s a whole group of them.\n\n\u201cReginald said we need to get another sacrifice for the next ritual to Neroth. You know Reginald is very particular about these things.\u201d A red robed individual says passing by.\n\u201cThen Reginald can stop buttfucking the baron\u2019s son for one second and start doing his own dirty work. I know he likes to think he\u2019s some sort of high priest of Neroth and all, but he\u2019s a fucking dabbling ponce. Him and his noble boyfriend have no real idea of how this shit works.\u201d Another one says.\n\u201cSay that to his face.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I will when the time comes. The only reason why I\u2019m following this fool, is because he\u2019s got connections. When this city is in our grasp, then all bets are off, and you, ALL of you had best know what side you stand on. A true believer in the ways of Neroth or a fucking pretender. Neroth isn\u2019t about sacrifices and decadent orgies. It\u2019s about fucking chaos. It\u2019s about bringing ruin to civilization. To spit in the eye of all things dedicated to order and good, even to the smallest degree. The Baron\u2019s son is free to take over this city if he wants, but I guarantee the only thing he\u2019s going to be ruling over is a smoldering pile of rubble. I suggest you ALL remember that.\u201d\n\nThe group of red robed folks don\u2019t say much to their more passionate comrade, but a couple give some quieter acknowledgements of agreement. Meanwhile you\u2019re still hiding in the darkness wondering if you\u2019ll get lucky and get a kill with every bullet before they take you down. Fortunately they move on past you without seeing you.\n\nAfter waiting a bit, you leave your hiding spot and make your way back even quicker than before. Even Warts isn\u2019t complaining anymore and is focused on escape.\n\nYou don\u2019t stop to rest until you get back up top.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026thank Yag we got outta there when we did.\u201d Warts says catching his breath.\n\u201cThank ME, that we got out when we did. I can only imagine the shit we would have been in had we still been in the house when they got back to it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, suppose that was good thinkin\u2019 on yer part. Guess you do deserve most of the loot.\u201d\n\u201cI was taking it anyway, such as it is. Damn, guess Yinen was right about Neroth cultists though. Just one more fucked up thing in this city. Probably best if I don\u2019t tell him where I got these bottles of wine.\u201d\n\nYou transfer the bottles out of Wart\u2019s pack and into your own and after a few exchanged words, you and he parts ways. You can\u2019t say this was the best night out, though you\u2019d be lying if a small part of you didn\u2019t get a minor thrill out of it all. You might have even enjoyed all this, if you made out with more stuff.\n\nYou return to Hell\u2019s Own and take the rest of the night off. Hopefully you can get a good price for the wine otherwise it really will have been all pretty pointless.\n\nThe next morning as soon as you make your way down stairs to go see Yinen, you\u2019re approached by two figures.\n\nOne of them is very non-descript and oldish looking man, probably not a bad quality to have for blending in with the crowd during a quick getaway actually. The other you can\u2019t tell due to the hood, but judging from the smaller body type with more curves, and long white hair peeking out from the hood they\u2019re probably female.\n\n\u201cHi, friend.\u201d The older one says.\n\u201cOkay, I already know anyone who starts calling me friend as a greeting is probably the exact opposite.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMy, you\u2019re a suspicious one. Though understandable and smart. However, if you give the pair of us time, you will soon see there is no need for animosity.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why I should give you time at all.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been operating on our turf for quite some time now.\u201d\n\nYour hearts sinks when you hear this and then you instinctively start to go for your weapon. However the older man backs off and raises his hands.\n\n\u201cRelax. That wasn\u2019t a threat. That was just to get your attention. We\u2019re not the Ebony Claw if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d He says.\n\u201cThieves Guild. Thought you guys didn\u2019t have turf.\u201d You say not really relaxing too much.\n\u201cOfficially we don\u2019t, but ever since the ECS, well it helps to label things. At least until they\u2019re gone anyway. In any case my name is Garrick and your recent exploits, along with your ongoing ones have caught our attention, so if you don\u2019t mind, can we sit down to speak?\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t plan on this, but it would probably be better if you didn\u2019t cause a scene, so you, Garrick and his quiet friend all sit at table.\n\n\u201cSo, this is Thieves Guild territory now? I always thought this place was supposed to be neutral.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt is for the most part it is, though officially it\u2019s ours. Really it just gets spread around that this is neutral territory to keep the new non-aligned thieves feeling safe. You\u2019re not exactly the only new one that\u2019s come through here thinking they don\u2019t have to join a side if they want to continue to ply their trade. You\u2019ve just lasted longer and shown more skill than most.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, is Warts part of the Thieves Guild?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, Warts is more of a outside ally. He\u2019s actually spoken highly of you. As has Yinen. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to see you for myself.\u201d\n\nWell this just goes to show how wet behind the ears you still are that you never thought that you\u2019d been in a Thieves Guild haven the whole time. Even Warts managed to fool you. Though it does explain a few things. Maybe this whole thing was a test.\n\n\u201cSo are you the leader of the Thieves Guild?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m more of its\u2026yes, well I guess leader would be the term, but honestly I hate it. You\u2019re probably thinking I\u2019m here to press gang you into joining, but I\u2019m not. In fact there was a time when this place was filled with freelance thieves. The city is a big thriving place after all, plenty of loot to go around. Our Guild is more of a club of sorts rather than some sinister octopus organization. People join because they want to, well that and the fact that we do tend to pull off the more lucrative jobs and get better deals on selling stolen merchandise. You have to do a job for the good of the Guild every now and then, but even then you still get a cut of the money. But I\u2019m sure to some extent, you\u2019re aware of some of this.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I am, but this still feels like recruitment.\u201d\n\u201cTimes are harder since the Ebony Claw moved in, and I won\u2019t lie, there is a war going on. And there is also strength and protection in numbers.\n\u201cSo which do you think is more necessary? Your protection or my strength?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not both? Look I can see you\u2019re in a bit of a hurry to sell off your loot, so how about this token of good will, I\u2019ll give you five platinum pieces what you got in your bag.\u201d\n\u201cFive plat?\u201d\n\nGarrick dumps the coins in front of you, which you immediately inspect. They\u2019re real and a lot more than what you were expecting to get for your trouble. Garrick\u2019s friend turns her head a bit towards him, but doesn\u2019t say anything. You get the impression she doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nMeanwhile, you waste no time in handing over the bottles to Garrick.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re really not here to force me to join you? This isn\u2019t a trick?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIf it was, do you think we\u2019d tell you? However, if you think you can handle the Syndicate all by yourself good luck. I\u2019m sure if you haven\u2019t caught their attention by now, you soon will. The ECS is fairly efficient that way. In any case, we\u2019re reaching a hand out to you because we think you\u2019d be an asset to the Guild. If you don\u2019t like it, you can always leave the city entirely. That\u2019s already better than the Claw. Once you join them, it\u2019s for life.\u201d Garrick remarks.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t planning on joining them either.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it, but will you at least think about our offer? If you change your mind, just let Yinen know. In any case, pleasure meeting you and doing business. Hope we can do it again on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nAnd with those last words, Garrick and his associate get up and make their exit, leaving you to ponder your next decision. Which of course is to go spend your new wealth.\n\nYou spend the next few days not doing much of anything other than buying some things you need and spending a little extra on better quality food than you normally do.\n\nYou also visit one of the better brothels in the city and as it turns out when you enter you\u2019re met with a lot of positivity by the madam and some of the other ladies. At first you figure they\u2019re just being nice to get more money out of you, but as it turns out the girl you set free back in Reginald\u2019s house was a worker here. (She\u2019s thoughtfully been given a couple days off so she can get her head back in the game again)\n\nAs a result of your actions, you get a discount, which you take full advantage of. You leave the brothel feeling like robbing that cultist\u2019s house wasn\u2019t a bad thing after all. You even entertain the idea that Yag has blessed you a bit.\n\nThen not five minutes later after leaving the brothel you\u2019re attacked on the street by three thugs catching you slipping.\n\nA crushing blow to your head is felt, though fortunately not enough to knock you out completely, just enough to cause you to fall to the ground.\n\n\u201cThis the one Mantis mentioned. Quick, let\u2019s finish him off.\u201d One says.\n\u201cYou idiot, we were supposed to drag him someplace quiet and not draw a fucking crowd in front of us.\u201d The second remarks.\n\u201cWhat difference does it make? Not like any of the people around are going to stop us anyway.\u201d The third adds.\n\u201cThe difference is we\u2019re supposed to be at least somewhat discreet.\u201d\n\u201cFuck that. This sends a message to everyone not to fuck with us!\u201d\n\u201cOkay then how about this? The Holgard Watch might look the other way every now and then, but they\u2019ll stop doing that if we\u2019re blatantly murdering people in the streets. Only they get to do that. You want to answer to Mantis when he\u2019s bitching about one of our Blue Dream houses getting raided suddenly?\u201d\n\u201cEh, fine. Better disarm this\u2026ARGH!\u201d one of the thugs shouts as you jam your dagger into his leg up to the hilt.\n\nYou scramble away and manage to get back up, but one of the thugs is already upon you. The whole time slack jawed gawkers either just watch in silence or they run off not wishing to be caught up in this.\n\nYou feel a punch to the face sending to back to the ground, but fortunately away from the pair of them. The two thugs ignore their companion still screaming with a dagger in his leg and advance on you again.\n\nYou aren\u2019t completely drained of energy, and you probably could try to run, they were arguing about not killing you in the street and given all the commotion going on, they may abandon their task if you prove to be too much trouble right now.\n\nOf course you don\u2019t have a pistol for nothing.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run", "result": "If you start killing people in the middle of the street in front of everyone, you\u2019re just going to bring unwanted heat on you by the Holgard Watch and unlike the Syndicate you don\u2019t have the luxury of having them in your pocket to look the other way. You pick yourself up and begin running again.\n\n\u201cShit, is this asshole really going to make me run? Fuck this.\u201d one of them says.\n\nIn a perfect world, this would be followed by them ceasing their harassment of you. In your world however, it means one of the thugs threw a dagger into your back.\n\nYou drop instantly.\n\n\u201cQuick, get him now!\u201d\n\nGroaning in pain, you fumble to grab your pistol. You manage to turn over and get off a shot, dropping one of your assailants, but the other quickly wrestles the weapon from you and begins beating you in the face with it. Your attempts to struggle soon come to an end as he begins destroying your nose along with the rest of your face with it.\n\nThe Ebony Claw Syndicate certainly sent a reminder to all onlookers that they are the not to be opposed.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Shoot", "result": "These people are already trying to kill you in broad daylight in front of people, all bets are fucking off.\n\nYou sit up and pull out your pistol which causes the closest thug\u2019s eyes to widen.\n\n\u201cShi\u2026\u201d is all he utters before you blast him in the chest.\n\nAs he falls, his comrade has already turned and ran, but you fire off another shot as soon as you stand back up and land a hit to the back of his skull.\n\nThe one you hit in the chest lies bleeding, clutching his blood soaked shirt and still convulsing. He\u2019s dying, but you\u2019re not waiting that long and shoot him in the head.\n\nYou pass by the other one you shot in the back of the head and towards the one still screaming about his leg. Except now, he\u2019s not crying about his leg now so much as he\u2019s begging for mercy.\n\n\u201cWait! Stop! If you kill me, the Ebony Claw Syndicate will continue to hound you! Let me live and I can\u2026\u201d he says before you interrupt.\n\u201cFuck you. You\u2019re nobody important and I\u2019d wager the ECS would look MORE favorable on me by culling their ranks of pieces of shit that can\u2019t even do their job right.\u201d You say, and then shoot him twice in the head.\n\nWith your last assailant dead, you grab your dagger out of his leg and get the hell out of the area since you\u2019ve become more aware of your surroundings which are people screaming, yelling and generally running away. While this place might be a crime cesspit, the fact that you openly killed three Ebony Claw members in front of everyone (Which is something at least one of them was trying to avoid doing to you) you probably look crazier than the usual type of criminal around here, especially since you aren\u2019t even in the worst part of the city.\n\nBesides all that, you don\u2019t exactly have any protection from the Holgard Watch so they aren\u2019t likely to just look away in your case.\n\nYou take several side streets and even backtrack a few times, before you eventually just go down one of the sewer openings in the hopes of hiding for a while.\n\nYou actually wander down there for a while since it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re an expert in navigating your way around in the sewers. You run into a few bums, some really destitute Blue Dream junkies, and some oversized fauna, but nobody of any major importance.\n\nEventually you get to a part of the sewer that seems familiar from the last time you were here and you make your way back up.\n\nWhen you exit, you find that you\u2019re not too far from Hell\u2019s Own Inn, so you get back there as soon as possible since you think you need to reconsider an option you were given earlier.\n\nYou head straight to Yinen who assumes you\u2019re to meet him for business as usual.\n\n\u201cHey, I got those bullets and that cleaning kit you wanted.\u201d Sinin says.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s great, I might be needing that soon, look I gotta talk to you. Garrick approached me a couple days ago.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah I know, I told him that I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be interested in joining\u2026wait I hope you\u2019re not mad at me for not telling you about having connections to the Guild. I assumed you probably knew somewhere in the back of your mind and I wasn\u2019t supposed to be announcing that anyway.\u201d\n\u201cShut up for a minute, I\u2019m trying to tell you that I want to join.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Garrick told me to talk to you if I changed my mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay. Yeah sure, what caused you to change your mind?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I guess the safety in numbers thing. So when do I get to go to the big hideout?\u201d\n\u201cHold on there! Just because you join doesn\u2019t mean you get to go to the main base of operations. If every new recruit got to go there after they joined, the ECS probably would have discovered its location by capturing and torturing one of them. There\u2019s also a process of weeding out potential spies. Certainly hope you didn\u2019t run off and join the ECS and then hope to get in good with them by doing that.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ECS is going to let me join anytime soon considering I just shot three of them.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d\n\u201cThree of them jumped me and I had to defend myself.\u201d\n\u201cAre they dead?\u201d\n\u201cI certainly hope so since I shot them all in the head to make sure.\u201d\n\nYou explain in a little more detail about what happened and Yinen starts to look more concerned.\n\n\u201cShit. Man, you\u2019re going to definitely be marked now. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t just leave the city.\u201d Sinin says.\n\u201cI thought about it as I was stomping around the sewers, but what good would that do? If the ECS is going to be as pissed at me as I think they\u2019ll probably be, it\u2019s not like they won\u2019t send assassins after me elsewhere. If I\u2019m here and join you guys at least there\u2019s a chance.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cHonestly, sometimes I wonder, but I guess I shouldn\u2019t talk like that. Shit, I can\u2019t believe that you\u2026well I\u2019ll definitely inform Garrick. I can\u2019t say if this is going to get you into the Guild lair itself, but it probably will make Garrick look favorably upon you. Just stay in this inn for a while, , all your food and drink will be taken care of. Someone more important than me will contact you. Here, take your bullets and kit while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\nYou take your stuff and head to your room where you immediately reload your pistol and start organizing your belongings and items, just in case you need to leave in a hurry.\n\nYou spend a lot of time in your room basically pacing the floor, wondering if you\u2019ve made the right decision, but you try not to think about it too much since it\u2019s done now and you\u2019ll hopefully have new allies that will at least watch your back.\n\nEventually you get tired of being in your room and decide to go take advantage of your free food and drink.\n\nYou find an empty table, put your back against the wall and partake in your meal. You constantly watch the door expecting trouble to come in.\n\nOf course while you were so busy watching the door, you completely didn\u2019t notice the person coming up to your table and sits down across from you.\n\nIt\u2019s the woman that was with Garrick earlier. You still can\u2019t quite make out her face, it\u2019s as if the hood completely shrouds it in darkness. The white hair still peaks out though.\n\nAs she sits across from you, she says nothing. She just stares. Or at least you assume she\u2019s staring at you, you can\u2019t see her eyes.\n\n\u201cHey. I remember you. You\u2019re Garrick\u2019s friend. Guess you\u2019re the one he sent to contact me.\u201d You say.\n\nYou get no answer.\n\nYou take a drink and try again.\n\n\u201cUm, never did get your name.\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\nYou wait for a little while expecting something, but just silence. You\u2019re a little on edge as it is, so you fall back to mild churlishness.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026is this silent act supposed to shed more light on whether or not I\u2019m in the Guild or not or are you just fascinated by my good looks?\u201d\n\nSuddenly a dagger comes short of severing the finger from your hand while the woman reaches over the table to grab you by your shirt. She\u2019s a lot stronger than she would appear since you\u2019re partially yanked out of your seat towards her.\n\nYou finally see her face due to being so close to her now. She\u2019s quite pretty. Unnaturally alluring might be a more accurate word, but obviously she isn\u2019t entirely human. Besides her hair being pure white, her eyes now give away an otherworldly appearance and right now her eyes are glowing a reddish color and look like they could twist mithril with the stare they\u2019re giving you.\n\n\u201cListen up, because I\u2019m only saying this once! Maybe Garrick thinks you\u2019re an asset to the Guild, but I\u2019m not convinced. You better show me something better than the pitiful displays you\u2019ve shown since you got here.\u201d She says.\n\nEvery logical fiber of your being tells you that you should just shut the fuck up, but maybe it\u2019s your nerves or you feel like this is some sort of test or maybe its this woman herself\u2026but whatever the reason\u2026 you don\u2019t shut the fuck up.\n\n\u201cSo, been watching me since I got here huh? Good to know.\u201d\n\nYou see her roll her eyes and she releases you and sits back down.\n\n\u201cPlease, I didn\u2019t even know about you until recently and that\u2019s only because you and that lowly halfbreed foolishly went and half assed robbed a rich Neroth cultist.\u201c the woman says.\n\u201cHey that wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d You point out.\n\u201cWell then you\u2019re shit at picking a partner and I question your wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fair, but I\u2019d say I made the best of the situation AND got out of there without getting caught.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? You ended up saving a whore who then blabbed to her fellow whores about the so-called noble thief that saved her life! You do realize that you\u2019re probably not JUST on the ECS hit list, but you\u2019ve probably just made enemies with certain members of what passes for the aristocracy around here along with a cult of fanatics.\u201d\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is I should have just left the girl to get tortured and killed. I\u2019ll remember that for next time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is it was fucking sloppy and you\u2019re not half as good as you think you are.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I know I can\u2019t be as bad as you\u2019re making out either. If I was so horrible, your boss wouldn\u2019t be considering me.\u201d\n\u201cFirst off, Garrick is NOT my fucking boss. I don\u2019t have a boss. Second, if you were any worse, I\u2019d seriously be questioning Garrick\u2019s decision on this. Arguably the ONLY thing in your favor as far as I\u2019m concerned is the fact you killed three ECS members. And you did that sloppy as well and it isn\u2019t making me inclined to impress me any more than when I first had the displeasure of laying eyes on you.\u201d\n\nThis girl REALLY dislikes you to a point where you\u2019re almost wondering if you did something to her personally or something. Then again you\u2019ve had people try to kill you for less.\n\nYet\u2026you can\u2019t help it\u2026there\u2019s something about her that just\u2026\n\n\u201cWell I hope I can impress you in the future since now that I have laid eyes upon your lovely face, I can definitely say that it has not been a displeasure.\u201d\n\nThe hooded woman sits back a bit as if you\u2019ve actually succeeded in making her slightly uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cMaybe you feeble charm works on whores, but you\u2019ll find that I\u2019m unimpressed by such attempts.\u201d She says dismissively.\n\u201cMaybe I need to try harder then.\u201d You respond.\n\nAt this point you succeed in making her angry again, she actually sits up and snatches her dagger out of the table and waves it at you.\n\n\u201cAnd maybe you need to learn your limitations.\u201d she exclaims.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just setting my sights higher. If I\u2019m joining your Guild, I\u2019m going to have to be better than I am. That means taking more risks even when there is potential danger.\u201d\n\nYou look at her dead serious when you say this. You actually don\u2019t even know where all this is coming from honestly. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re under a spell. The hooded woman doesn\u2019t even acknowledge what you\u2019re saying.\n\n\u201cTomorrow night, be prepared to go on a job with a Guild member. A REAL Guild member. He will meet you here and from there we\u2019ll see if we need to waste anymore time with you.\u201d She says.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be you? A pity, well I\u2019ll be looking forward to the day when we can do a job together.\u201d You respond.\n\nWithout even realizing it, you\u2019ve touched her other hand that\u2019s on the table.\n\nShe of course immediately notices this and for a split second she probably considers breaking or stabbing your hand, but instead she just pulls her hand away and then steps back from the table altogether.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you are not going to last that long.\u201d She says and then leaves.\n\nAs soon as she steps out of the inn, you sit there in a daze for a while, but then you suddenly snap out of it.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was wrong with me? I could have gotten myself killed, flirting like that.\u201d\n\nYou briefly wonder if maybe you drank too much, but that definitely wasn\u2019t it. You\u2019d say it was the woman herself that was causing you to do that, but she didn\u2019t seem like she wanted anything to do with you on that front.\n\nYou head back to your room and you can\u2019t get your mind off of her. You\u2019d visit a brothel, but that didn\u2019t work out so well last time. So you take the matter in hand\u2026\n\nBy the time the tomorrow night rolls around, you\u2019re sort of glad to meet up with the other Guild member since you\u2019re hoping it will clear your mind.\n\nThe Guild member in question calls himself Sneaks. He\u2019s an older man, though certainly still younger than Garrick. Says he\u2019s been friends with Garrick for a long time and also mentions that he hopes you\u2019re as promising as he\u2019s heard.\n\nThe job that you and Sneaks are to perform doesn\u2019t sound all that difficult, which is just as well since you\u2019re still having problems focusing. When he asks if you have any questions, you just have one and that\u2019s what\u2019s the name of the hooded woman who spoke to you yesterday.\n\nImmediately Sneaks shakes his head.\n\n\u201cOh for\u2026you saw her face and looked straight into her eyes didn\u2019t you? Fuck. Well that explains why she came back all pissed off and not very talkative yesterday. Though she\u2019s surly at the best of times. It\u2019s a temporary effect kid, try to just focus on the job okay?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nSneaks sighs a bit.\n\n\u201cOkay, real quick. Her name is Tanya and if you want to make yourself happy, you will NOT pursue that one. Just forget about her. I know it\u2019s difficult right now, but you\u2019ll be better off. Trust me.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cIs she involved with someone else?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNot exactly, but\u2026look she\u2019s got some demon blood in her. I mean surely you realized that she wasn\u2019t quite human right?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but demon didn\u2019t come to mind, but so what? I don\u2019t care, I want to get to know her\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHah! I know how YOU want to get to know her! Trust me, you aren\u2019t the first to try, and you probably won\u2019t be the last, but so far every guy I\u2019ve seen try has failed. Just walk away. Now get your mind off her ass and back to business.\u201d\n\nWhile Sneaks\u2019 advice is well meaning, it wasn\u2019t exactly Tanya\u2019s ass that was clouding your mind, but rather her face. Fortunately Sneaks is also correct in that the effect does seem to dissipate.\n\nAs for the job, it goes a lot better than the one you did with Warts that\u2019s for sure.\n\nSneaks says that it\u2019ll still be awhile before you\u2019re allowed to actually go to the Guild proper, he says that as long as you keep up the good work, you\u2019ll eventually get to see it.\n\nHowever, at this point you just want to see Tanya again. Looks like she didn\u2019t leave your thoughts completely.\n\nProbably for the best that she\u2019s still lingering in your mind, because if you really thought about just how deep of shit you probably are as far as powerful enemies you\u2019ve made, you\u2019d probably be a lot more depressed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 18\n\n\u201cYep, Garrick\u2019s been very impressed with you. I\u2019d say a few more jobs and you\u2019ll finally get invited to where all the magic takes place.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell geez son, don\u2019t sound so enthusiastic. Last year you kept asking me if you were any closer to getting into the Guild headquarters.\u201d\n\u201cLast year, I was still a bit more optimistic about my choice in joining the guild.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And how exactly did we fail you your majesty?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what I mean, but if we\u2019re going that route, I just thought I\u2019d be doing slightly better while aligned with you lot.\u201d\n\nSneaks starts laughing.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s your first problem right there. Joining a criminal organization that\u2019s currently feuding with another one isn\u2019t exactly a stable future son.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cI know that too, it\u2019s just\u2026okay\u2026I\u2019m just a little concerned that we aren\u2019t doing too much directly against the Ebony Claw Syndicate. I mean shouldn\u2019t we be doing something more to decrease their power? Their presence hasn\u2019t exactly decreased in the city and if anything it has only gotten stronger.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cI dunno about that, I\u2019d say they\u2019re probably struggling like everyone else currently. If they were truly stronger in presence they\u2019d be directly attacking us and some of our hangouts more often.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s still a problem since it\u2019s still not progress, it\u2019s just keeping the status quo.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do? Shoot them all?\u201d\n\u201cWell considering how many I have shot, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a bad plan. Not to mention it\u2019s something I could have easily done on my own.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you would have been dead already on your own. But if you really feel like you could do better on your own then nothing is holding back from leaving. Why stay?\u201d\n\u201cBecause obviously I\u2019m still an optimistic idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, I believe its MORE likely you\u2019re just sticking around because you\u2019re an infatuated idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, I know you still got a thing for Tanya after I told you to just walk away. I remember when we all had to work on that job together three months ago, I swear at one point with how hard you were starin\u2019 at her, I thought you were going to whip your dick out and start wackin\u2019 it right there.\u201d\n\nYou laugh at that remark.\n\n\u201cYou laugh because you know it\u2019s true.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cYeah well it certainly is a better reason than anything else I could come up with, and I\u2019m not totally convinced that goal isn\u2019t at least as possible as wiping out the ECS as a force in this city.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cI dunno about that. You\u2019ve at least killed Ebony Claw members, you haven\u2019t even gotten a kind word from Tanya yet.\u201d\n\u201cYes I did! She said she couldn\u2019t believe I was still alive and that I had to be the idiot bastard son of Yag eternally blessed with more luck than actual ability.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well actually coming from her that IS a kind word. Congrats. At the risk of inflating your ego even more\u2026and she\u2019d probably kill me if I told you\u2026she actually would somewhat agree with you on your views about the Ebony Claw. She sort of wishes we took the fight more to them too. Actually you could probably count me in that group as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo why the hell aren\u2019t we doing more then and why isn\u2019t Garrick being pro-active?\u201d\n\u201cHe actually is, just not in the way you think. He thinks an all out gang war would be a mistake due to them having the numbers. He might be right, I don\u2019t know. But all that shit we steal and the Guild gets a cut of? That doesn\u2019t all just go towards equipment and extra casks of booze for the headquarters. Some of that money goes towards more important things like bribes, paying off the Watch and getting a few underpaid bean counters on our side to muddle paper work on occasion.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s great and all, but how\u2019s that fuck up the Ebony Claw?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but it keeps a balance. You don\u2019t think they don\u2019t do the same thing? Try to manipulate the law in their favor? The only reason why the Holgard Watch doesn\u2019t mess with either side much is because they\u2019re taking bribes from both sides. They got best racket in this city. They practically never even have to do their fucking jobs! Garrick HOPES that one day he\u2019ll be able to manipulate the right people that will cripple the EC, but I can say right now, he\u2019s doomed to failure, because at his core, he\u2019s too fucking nice. Bribery only gets you so far. To do what he wants to do, he\u2019d need to rely more on blackmail and extortion, which isn\u2019t something he\u2019s too fond of getting heavily into.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised nobody\u2019s tried to kill him and take power from him.\u201d\n\u201cI said he\u2019s nice, not a pussy. There have been a few who have tried over the years, mostly before the EC established a greater presence, but the man isn\u2019t unskilled in the ways of defending himself. Besides the Thieves Guild isn\u2019t the Ebony Claw and because Garrick is so fucking nice, people generally like him enough that they\u2019d rather keep him as head of the organization. Not to mention we don\u2019t exactly have the most ambitious bunch in the Guild. Most of the really ruthless, kill their own mother types to get ahead join the EC. We\u2019re not Joachimites, but I\u2019d still wager that most of us in the Guild have just a few more scruples than the average EC member.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well scruples doesn\u2019t win wars.\u201d\n\u201cNo argument there. Look kid, I\u2019m not sure what to tell you, except I do hope you stick with us. I don\u2019t care what your reasons are, whether its for safety, or riches or your ongoing failed pursuit of Tanya\u2019s demon pussy. We need more\u2026for the lack of a better word\u2026warrior types in the Guild.\u201d\n\u201cNever considered myself a warrior before, but I suppose I\u2019ll take it as a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you will, that\u2019s how I meant it. Anyway, I gotta go. Garrick\u2019s holding some sort of meeting for some of us important elite. Tell ya what, I\u2019ll try to convince Garrick to let you in the Guild\u2019s inner sanctum already. I know it\u2019s not Tanya\u2019s inner sanctum, but here\u2019s something that might help you in that goal, she\u2019s supposed to be casing the Museum of the Ancients tonight. Who knows, maybe if you get there quick enough she might even let you help.\u201d\n\nAs your eyes light up, Sneaks smiles and parts ways with you.\n\nYou of course don\u2019t waste any time heading to the Museum of the Ancients.\n\nYou\u2019ve never considered burglarizing that place before, but you suppose it makes sense that there would be some pretty valuable stuff in there. Though you imagine that it\u2019s more protected than even some of the banks here.\n\nYou\u2019ve only had the fortune of working with Tanya a couple times before and that was always in a group and she of course always limited her contact with you in those cases.\n\nYou still don\u2019t exactly know WHY you\u2019re as drawn to her as you are. Well you do and it\u2019s probably due to her demonic heritage and whatever powers of charm she put on you. (Accidently you guess given her stand offish personality towards you)\n\nSneaks said the effects should have worn off by now since you don\u2019t even see her that much. Granted you aren\u2019t thinking about her all the time, but if you ever have the chance to be around her (Like you do now) you\u2019re going to take it.\n\nLuckily you manage to arrive unaccosted by anyone, the law or otherwise. Now you\u2019re just hoping you find Tanya before the fun begins.\n\nThe surrounding area outside the museum, the place is more or less empty. There aren\u2019t too many other people in the area other than a few Holgard Watchmen patrolling around which you keep clear of.\n\nYou look around to see where Tanya might be, but again its possible she already went inside. You bet she went in from the rooftop. Every time you\u2019ve worked with her, she\u2019s always favoring the rooftops.\n\nOf course you prefer a more grounded approach so as soon as it looks safe, you simply run up to the front door and pick the lock, which is a lot easier than you thought it would be.\n\nYou look around the museum and mostly see a lot of oversized items that you\u2019d need at least two people to carry to get out of here. Statues, suits of rusty armor, oversized tapestries and the like. While you\u2019re sure some of this stuff is valuable to someone, it wouldn\u2019t exactly be the easiest to just lift out of here. Though you haven\u2019t seen or heard any night guards of any kind at all. Seems weird that this place doesn\u2019t have any security.\n\nYou try to keep an ear out for anyone that might be walk around, but it\u2019s nothing but silence. You start to wonder if she came and left already or maybe this was all Sneaks idea of a practical joke. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nSince you can\u2019t find her or detect anyone else roaming these halls, you decide that you might as well see if there actually is anything here that you might be worth taking.\n\nEventually after wandering a bit, you stumble into an area that seems more promising.\n\n\u201cRoyal treasures of Old Galpatis\u201d you say to yourself as you read the sign to exhibit room.\n\nYou don\u2019t know too much about Galpatis except shit that your sister sometimes spoke about from some book she read. It was supposed to be a great empire thousands of years ago that destroyed itself as all these ancient civilizations tend to do for whatever reason. Probably had something to do with necromancy or something.\n\nIn any case you enter and see in the dim torchlight you see proper treasure that you could actually carry out of here. A lot of old necklaces, bracelets, crowns with gems and similar items behind glass, though some, like the weapons are mounted securely on the wall.\n\nA couple of weapons that catch your eye are a pair of ornate looking dagger. Not even tarnished and definitely still usable. You probably could easily pry them from the walls though you\u2019d have to reach a bit since they\u2019re little higher than you.\n\nOf course you do have your trusty glasscutter with you and you could just start getting to work on grabbing what you can from the displays.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get the daggers", "result": "It suddenly occurs to you that maybe there are traps about, but they\u2019re magical in nature. You start cutting the glass and who knows what might happen. The daggers seem like there is possibly less danger involved seeing as they just fastened them to the wall.\n\nOf course it isn\u2019t just an easy matter of ripping the dagger from the wall, you grab a prybar from your pack and start to get to work, but given their height above you, it\u2019s awkward.\n\nYou pry and pry, but don\u2019t seem to be making any headway. You begin to think that the daggers are being held in place by magic and you might be right considering that you suddenly feel a force knock the prybar from your hand and as you try to grab it you stumble into one of the isolated stands with a glass case knocking it over and falling on the broken glass.\n\nFortunately you\u2019re mostly protected by your clothing, though you\u2019re still picking glass out of bits of your body. However, you don\u2019t do that for long since you notice the diamond necklace that has now been released from its cage. You might as well grab that instead.\n\nNo sooner have you picked it up and that\u2019s when you feel an unnatural chill in the air.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d You say and get the hell out of the Galpatis exhibit room.\n\nDoesn\u2019t help though, you\u2019re still feeling like the unnatural cold is following you. You get the very real feeling that SOMETHING is following you, but you don\u2019t dare look behind you, all you want to do is get out of the museum and HOPE that whatever this is doesn\u2019t follow you outside.\n\nYou see the exit in the distance and then you see a wispy green glow materialize in front of it. A malevolent face briefly appears and then one of the statues closest to you comes to life!\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you exclaim and just barely manage to avoid getting your head smashed in.\n\nYou look around and see that now several of the statues are coming to life. The exit is blocked by that ghostly thing so even if you could maneuver past the statues, you aren\u2019t getting out that way.\n\n\u201cHEY! Grab the damn rope!\u201d a voice shouts from above.\n\nYou look up and see Tanya on the second floor throwing a rope to you over the railing. You waste no time in grabbing and climbing up it while she pulls you up.\n\nThe statues try to grab you at first, but then soon realize the best way to get you is going up the stairs.\n\nAs you grab the railing, Tanya grabs your arm and hoists you over it. You almost feel like she\u2019s going to yank your arm off, but of course you see a glimpse of her face again as she\u2019s pulling you up and you\u2019re almost smitten enough to forget all about the extreme danger you\u2019re currently in.\n\nHurry you fool before I regret saving you!\u201d Tanya shouts and runs towards another rope that hangs from an opening she\u2019s made in the glass dome on the roof\n\nFollowing her lead you make your way to the rope and quickly climb up it where you\u2019re staring directly at Tanya\u2019s ass the entire time. Again, probably a good thing since your focus isn\u2019t on the invisible horrors that are desperately trying to get your attention by whispering demoralizing things in your ears to cause you to give up hope and stop trying to escape.\n\nDoesn\u2019t work though, Tanya\u2019s ass is literally saving your own. Eventually you manage to get to the roof where you and Tanya both start leaping across the tops of nearby buildings. When you get far enough away, Tanya at last stops to take a breather and then also punches you in the face.\n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDo you even need to ask?! Your incompetent bumbling nearly got not just yourself killed, but ME as well! What the fuck were you even doing there? Did you KNOW I was going to be there?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess, Sneaks told you\u2026I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cWhere were you anyway? I looked for you for awhile.\u201d\n\u201cI was in the basement stealing the Tivan Crystal.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t think to check the basement.\u201d\n\u201cGiven all the security you set off, it\u2019s apparent you didn\u2019t think at all! I was just on my way to leave when I heard glass breaking and the scampering of your feet. Did you really think you could just smash and grab shit in a place like that without consequence?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to at first. It was an accident. I just wanted to get you something since I couldn\u2019t find you. Here.\u201d You say and pull the diamond necklace out of your bag.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? I could steal, and have stolen items a lot more valuable than this!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you have, but its value is not the point, this is my gift to you. The motivation behind it is important.\u201d\n\u201cYou expect me to believe you stole this for me?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve what you wish, the point is that it\u2019s yours now my dear.\u201d You say and put the necklace in her hand. Tanya looks at the necklace in disbelief, and addresses you again.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026wait\u2026you REALLY think I\u2019m going to wear this? Surely even someone of your intelligence can see that I\u2019m not some dainty aristocrat who dresses in fancy gowns and adores myself with jewelry.\u201d\n\u201cYou may do whatever you wish with it. You may throw it away, keep it and wear it, keep it and then sell it or just keep it period. It doesn\u2019t matter. It was just my way of thanking you for not just saving my life, but also the pleasure of being in the glow of your beauty.\u201d\n\nTanya is now looking at you in disbelief.\n\n\u201c\u2026you\u2026you\u2026I\u2026\u201d Tayna starts to say.\n\u201cYes?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLook! I don\u2019t know what the hell your game is, but I\u2019m not playing, and I\u2019m not fooled!\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to fool you, it\u2019s merely a gift to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop it! Stop it right now! And stop looking at me like that, if you want to keep your eyesight! I don\u2019t want to hear anymore of your honeyed words! We part ways here and don\u2019t you dare try to follow me!\u201d Tanya yells and pulls her hood even more over her head, before leaping to the next building.\n\nYou naturally ignore her and start following her anyway. You must hop across three rooftops before Tanya stops again.\n\n\u201cLOOK, this is NOT going to\u2026\u201d\n\nA bolt whizzing by suddenly interrupts Tanya\u2019s words.\n\nAt first you think briefly that it\u2019s the guardian museum and it\u2019s followed you, but it turns out to be a more tangible enemy instead.\n\nSeveral men with crossbows suddenly materialize on the roofs nearby and a few of them even on the roof you\u2019re currently on. You both instantly duck down and try to find cover.\n\nSeveral other bolts follow though fortunately the ECS has not employed skilled marksmen.\n\n\u201cBah! All those bolts and you lot couldn\u2019t hit a behemoth\u2019s butt with a bass fiddle! I told you fuckers to practice! Just fucking close in for the kill!\u201d you hear someone shout.\n\nYou and Tanya can\u2019t go in any direction without facing ECS members, but given the state you\u2019re in right now, you\u2019re not exactly avoiding a fight and neither is Tanya.\n\n\u201cLooks like some of the EC are begging to be declawed. I\u2019m always up for whittling down their ranks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFirst thing you\u2019ve said, that I agree with.\u201d Tanya remarks.\n\nWhile the EC might be terrible shots, you certainly aren\u2019t, you shoot three of them before they even manage to close in. Tanya on the other hand is perfectly content on taking on five of the assassins in close combat.\n\nOne of the members however is standing back and still blinking in and out of existence. He\u2019s obviously using that blasted shadow magic. He\u2019s mainly giving orders right now, but if he gets in the fight, you don\u2019t anticipate things going well.\n\nYou try to take aim at him, but you\u2019re stopped by two EC members who both nearly stab you. After dodging their blows, you shoot the pair of them.\n\nSeeing as you\u2019ve only got one shot left and no real time to reload, you turn your attention back to the EC leader, who is now gone. Tanya is still working on two other EC members and you\u2019re about to go over to help her, when a magic missile of some sort hits you.\n\nYou drop your weapon and collapse. You almost feel like all the energy has been drained out of you. You\u2019re so weak, you can hardly even push yourself back up, though a hefty kick soon stops that attempt.\n\n\u201cFinally got your ass! It\u2019s like they always say, you want something done right, ya gotta do it yourself. So you think you can just get away with shooting our members like some cowardly sonofabitch?\u201d the shadow magic wielder remarks.\n\u201cYou\u2026you just hit me with a fucking magic missile!\u201d you wheeze, pointing out his hypocrisy.\n\nThis of course isn\u2019t appreciated and you soon receive another kick.\n\n\u201cSilence! I\u2019m gonna enjoy this.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he doesn\u2019t get the chance due to all his gloating which was enough time for Tanya to finish off her last opponent and run over to help you again.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick enough to avoid her attacks.\n\nThe pair of them duel while you lie there trying to gather your strength. You\u2019re really woozy and weak.\n\nYou eventually manage to stand up, but you feel like you\u2019re going to teeter over again. Tanya is still fighting the EC leader, but she\u2019s not making much progress. In fact, he might even have a slight advantage since he hasn\u2019t been exerting himself as much as she has tonight.\n\nYou look over to your right and see your pistol lying nearby. You\u2019ve got one shot in it and you\u2019re not exactly in the best condition as far as accurately aiming anything right now.\n\nOf course you could just try to help Tanya in the more traditional way and try to backstab him. Still not ideal, but if you miss, you\u2019re not likely to hit Tanya by accident.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get your pistol", "result": "In the condition you\u2019re in and how quick he\u2019s moving, you question if you\u2019ll even be able to hit him, but you also know you\u2019re currently not much good in a straight up fight right now.\n\nYou stagger over to your pistol and nearly fall over just trying to pick it up. You look over at the duel and Tanya\u2019s still holding her own, but the bastard\u2019s shadow magic is giving him the edge. You try to aim, but you can\u2019t get a clear shot and when you do, he\u2019s already moved out of the way or you\u2019re suffering from dizziness.\n\nYou try to get a little closer and every inch of you is struggling to not slip into unconsciousness. You see the EC member block several of Tanya\u2019s attacks and then manages to knock her down with some sort of glowing magic from his hand.\n\nHe moves in for the kill as she hits the ground, but it\u2019s best opening you\u2019ve got now. You fire and hope the figure in the center is the real one before you collapse again.\n\nYou aren\u2019t unconscious for long as Tanya soon slaps you awake.\n\n\u201cHey, get up! We need to get out of here, before more of these assholes show up.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cGuh, did I get that sonofabitch?\u201d you utter and slowly sit up.\n\u201cYeah, you blew half of his head off. Pretty sure that was Mantis.\u201d\n\u201cMantis\u2026I think I heard that name before.\u201d\n\u201cYou should, he was one of the Ebony Claw\u2019s lieutenants. Explains why he had access to shadow magic.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well his magic couldn\u2019t stop a bullet. You okay?\u201d\n\nAs you ask this, you touch Tanya\u2019s arm, which she retracts.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine! Get your hands off me! And I could have taken him without your help you know.\u201d Tanya exclaims.\n\u201cI know, just trying to help.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYeah, well your help could have gotten me killed what with you stumbling all over the place.\u201d\n\u201cApologies.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well, I guess you did do your part. Almost makes up for the bumbling you did back at the museum. Anyway I highly recommend that YOU go home as soon as you can, I\u2019m going to go report everything to the Guild.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I come with you?\u201d\n\u201cHah, nice try, but there are still questions out on you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fucking killing EC members since I joined and I just shot one of their leaders in the face. Fairly certain I\u2019m on your side.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not up to me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re saying if it WAS up to you, you\u2019d let me in?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, and I\u2019m going to address something else. While I know its unfortunate that my\u2026ugh\u2026 condition has made you more drawn to me, you need to fucking snap out of it. It\u2019s been two years and even those I work with closely don\u2019t behave this way around me.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the stories Sneaks has told me, you\u2019ve put so much fear in would be suitors that they\u2019re too scared to make any advances on you. Just because they\u2019re not being obvious about it, doesn\u2019t mean the desire isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, Sneaks talks too much and second, well maybe YOU need to start internalizing some of that desire as well. Get control of yourself. It\u2019ll get better and go away over time.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe my feelings are genuine, you ever think of that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah right. You barely even know me.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019d like to get to know you better. I mean you think I\u2019m a complete fucking idiot? I know that your little demon aura or whatever is probably affecting me, but that\u2019s really not having as much of an effect on this as you think. Especially since I don\u2019t just think about us in a sexual manner. I think about us just talking and\u2026\u201d\n\nTanya looks at you very irritated by your words.\n\n\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want to hear anymore. Shut up and don\u2019t bring up my condition again! Stick to jacking off or get yourself a whore, I don\u2019t give a fuck WHAT you do, just fucking do it and get yourself under fucking control! You flirt with me again and it\u2019ll be the last fucking time, got it?!\u201d\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t even give you a chance to respond, she just turns away from you and takes off across the rooftops again. You don\u2019t follow, not due to fearing for any violent repercussion, but more because you\u2019re not exactly feeling up to leaping across rooftops right now. Instead, you go ahead and loot the Ebony Claw members\u2019 bodies. Sort of makes up for not getting anything from the museum.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you feel your strength has returned enough that you can safely climb down from your position and get back to street level again.\n\nYou look at your full coin pouch and ponder your next move.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess the night is still young. Might as well.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later you arrive at your destination.\n\n\u201cHey! Haven\u2019t seen you here in a long time! How\u2019s the scourge of the Ebony Claw?\u201d the madam asks.\n\u201cIs that what I\u2019m being called now?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure in certain circles you are, the EC more likely has more colorful names for you, but let\u2019s not dwell on that. You\u2019re here for fun. What would you like tonight?\u201d\n\u201cUh, I kind of have a special request. I know it\u2019s short notice, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSay no more! We\u2019ll do everything to try to accommodate your needs as long as you have the coin and don\u2019t worry, your discount is still in place!\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nYou start going into an elaborate description of what you want the girl to look like. The madam nods a few times.\n\n\u201cYeah, we can accommodate that, and I know just the right girl too. Head on upstairs third door on your right. She\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d\n\nYou head upstairs feeling a little weird about all this, while you\u2019re waiting you almost have second thoughts, then the girl comes in.\n\nYou see a girl wearing nothing but a black open cloak. All her fun parts are fully exposed to you, save for her face, which is partially hidden due to a hood over the top half of her head. Long white hair can be seen peeking out though. They did a pretty good job in matching your description.\n\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m Tanya and\u2026\u201d the girl says.\n\u201cStop. Don\u2019t say anymore. Your voice doesn\u2019t sound like hers and you\u2019re already too friendly. I don\u2019t want to ruin the illusion so let\u2019s just get to it.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, fake Tanya approaches you and you waste no time spinning her around, lifting her cloak up, and doing her on all fours, mainly because it\u2019s easier to immerse yourself if you aren\u2019t looking at her face which might work from a distance, but isn\u2019t going work very well if you\u2019re staring full on at her.\n\nIn any case, the session is pretty intense.\n\nAfterwards you\u2019re collapsed on the bed, while \u201cTanya\u201d professionally starts to collect herself.\n\n\u201cI know you got other customers, I\u2019ll get up in a second, I just gotta catch my breath for a moment.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTake your time, I wasn\u2019t shoving you out the door just yet. I know you didn\u2019t want me to talk, but I felt like I should at least thank you before we parted ways here.\u201d She says.\n\u201cThank me? For what?\u201d\n\u201cFor saving my life of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cTanya\u201d takes off the hood and white wig revealing her natural brown hair. Now that you\u2019ve got a full look at her, you recognize her, even if the voice wasn\u2019t immediately familiar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you! You were the one I freed from that cage!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYep, it\u2019s me. I actually worried that you MIGHT recognize me and it would break your illusion, glad that it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you were just about perfect\u2026shit\u2026so how have you been?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Okay I guess. A lot more paranoid, still have nightmares sometimes, but at least I\u2019m still alive and attractive enough to still whore.\u201d\n\u201cDamn\u2026well let me at least pay full price, I know the madam said I had a discount, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh no. This one\u2019s on me. No charge at all and I\u2019ll just make up the difference elsewhere. Honestly, I wanted to reward you before, but I missed you the first time you came here and then you never came back here until tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose I\u2019ve been a bit busy what with fighting the ECS and all.\u201d\n\u201cHm. We all got our struggles. Well, I guess we better get going, time and money and all. You did have a good time though right?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh yeah! Yes, it was good. There were definitely times where I thought I was with\u2026well someone else.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything else and just focus on getting dressed. As you start to leave, you ask one more question.\n\n\u201cWhat is your real name?\u201d\n\u201cNaji.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t exchange any more words with her and you exit the establishment.\n\nBeen a weird night for you. Granted you\u2019ve had more than your fair share of such nights, but this one will probably stand out in your mind.\n\nEspecially due to what happens next.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around. Into that alley now. You try anything, and you\u2019ll have a bolt through the back. Move.\u201d A voice whispers as you feel a crossbow shoved into your back.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even see anyone around, but you don\u2019t have much choice except to comply for now. When you get to the alley you\u2019re met by a scarred looking man with an eye patch.\n\n\u201cAh there you are, we have much to discuss. My name is Rook.\u201d He says.\n\nRook looks like an assassin of some sort, but it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s also a man that prides himself on how he looks since even in this dirty alley he stands out as being dressed more like a government official rather than some lowly thug.\n\nHis eye patch has a claw symbol on it. His comrade with the crossbow is still unknown to you since you haven\u2019t turned around at all. About all you tell is that they\u2019re very fond of that crossbow.\n\nAfter sizing you up a bit, Rook speaks again.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy during your stay here in Holgard. Pick pocketing, burglary, and all those other activities that are frowned upon by the law. Not to mention all the Ebony Claw members you\u2019ve been murdering. So tell me, do you feel that you can just rob this city blind and do as you please?\u201d Rook asks.\n\u201cBasically.\u201d You retort.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201c Because I can.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see. You feel your skills are a waste if not practiced. I can identify with that.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Rook slugs you in the stomach, dropping you to your knees. You didn\u2019t even see it coming since he was standing far enough a way that he wasn\u2019t in reach and then suddenly he was in front of you. As you struggle back up, you feel that blasted crossbow still at your back.\n\n\u201cNormally someone like you would be disposed of, however many of my peers are short sighted and don\u2019t always see opportunity clearly. The fact that you\u2019ve managed to survive this long either means you\u2019re incredibly lucky or you\u2019re more intelligent than you appear. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the latter since if you are intelligent that means you have untapped potential.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cI sure hope so at this point.\u201d You respond still trying to gather yourself from Rook\u2019s punch.\n\u201cI do too, because despite what you may have heard about us, you will soon see that if you\u2019re in this line of work, joining the Ebony Claw really is the way of the future. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re somewhat aware, you\u2019ve come at an interesting time. There are some changes going on in this city. Rebellion in the air, rumors of demonic cultists, but none of that matters. Business is what matters. What matters is that WE come out on top when smoke clears. The best way we can do that, is by controlling as much of the criminal activity as possible. By uniting the Underworld under one organization we will be able to survive whatever chaos is to come. That is the goal of the Ebony Claw Syndicate\u2026well at least one of the goals anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSo I take it you\u2019re the head of the Ebony Claw?\u201d\n\nThis comment makes Rook smirk a little.\n\n\u201cOh no. I\u2019m merely one of the more important people in this particular city. There are far more higher ranking people than myself all over, but we all perform our tasks for things we believe in and our various loyalties right?\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cThe Thieves Guild is one of the chief obstacles that stands in the way of my task. This relic of the past still holds on to their shortsighted archaic ideas and morals. Their antics bring unnecessary chaos, which is certainly something we don\u2019t need more of in this city. Still, they aren\u2019t complete fools as they have managed to hide within the city and we still can\u2019t locate their hideout. Surprisingly even the ones we\u2019ve captured have either managed to kill themselves or been dedicated enough that they have not revealed its location. I also am working with less than ideal resources available. If things were different\u2026but\u2026ah I get off topic. In any case, I am looking for alternative solutions. One of these involves you.\u201d\n\u201cI hate to break this to you, but they haven\u2019t even let me in their little clubhouse yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure that will change soon. I mean from what I can tell, you\u2019re a rising star in their organization. I have full confidence that you will be soon accepted.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re more optimistic than me then.\u201d\n\u201cYou find that in this line of work, optimism helps keep you going at times, which is why I\u2019m also optimistic that when the time comes you WILL see the advantage of joining US.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause, you\u2019re not just a mere rogue. You\u2019re a killer. You could even be an assassin if you wanted to be. Granted you\u2019re not exactly subtle what with your love of firearms, but sometimes that isn\u2019t important. The Thieves Guild is limited. The Ebony Claw? WE are everywhere! You have the potential to really rise up in ranks. You want money? Infamy? Power? It\u2019s all available if you\u2019re smart and skilled enough.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like this is a trick.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t be wrong to think that. Paranoia is good and healthy, but I promise you that this is a real offer. I know you\u2019ll need to think about this though, so I don\u2019t expect you to agree right now. However, if you want some sort of assurance that I\u2019m telling the truth, all hits on you are called off. As of right now unless you\u2019re attacking an EC member and they\u2019re acting in self defense, you will not be targeted.\u201d\n\nNow this really sounds like a trick.\n\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s true. Wish I could have stopped that fool Mantis BEFORE we met, but seems like you took care of that. Oh and thanks for eliminating a rival tonight. Anyway, I trust you\u2019ll be making the right decision, because it would be a shame if I had to kill you the next time we see each other.\u201d Rook then chuckles a bit at his comment.\n\n\u201cWhat am I saying? You wouldn\u2019t see me, if I killed you.\u201d\n\nWith that last threat, Rook takes his leave, you don\u2019t feel the crossbow anymore so you slowly turn around, but as expected nobody is there.\n\nThe next day just when you think your life can\u2019t get any more complicated\u2026\n\n\u201cHey kid! Good news! You\u2019re in! We were debating about letting you in early and a lot of people were against it since they felt you needed to spend more paying dues as it were, but then Tanya came back and spoke about what you did last night against the Ebony Claw and her opinions pushed Garrick, who was just bending to popular opinion anyway, to make a final decision to let you in! Ain\u2019t that great?\u201d Sneaks says.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026great.\u201d You remark.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 19\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the third large group of cultists we\u2019ve had to evade in our own fucking sewers. Something needs to be done about those shitheads because not even the EC is giving us this much trouble down here.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cAgreed. They\u2019ve been spreading all over the damn place. Granted I\u2019m not much for religion, but given what I know from what Yinen has said about Neroth AND seen what these fanatics do first hand, I\u2019m not exactly keen on them spreading any further.\u201d You add.\n\u201cI understand the concerns, but we\u2019re already warring with the EC, the last thing we need is to open up a front against a bunch of Neroth worshipers.\u201d Garrick says.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to open up a front, because they\u2019ve already made it quite clear that they\u2019ve already done so. I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but every time I bump into those fanatics they attack on sight.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just bumping into them accidentally, then you\u2019re lucky because I know by their personalized threats they\u2019re specifically targeting me.\u201d You add.\n\u201cI told you that rescuing that whore would catch up to you.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cThat was years ago and they didn\u2019t even see me do it!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that tart and her friends spread the word about your deeds a long time ago. I\u2019m more surprised they you weren\u2019t targeted sooner by them.\u201d\n\u201cWell apparently they were too busy with other things than bothering with the likes of the kid here. In any case I\u2019m just saying we need to thin out their ranks or something because while I know we aren\u2019t officially territorial, we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with daggers at our throats right outside our front door.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cExactly. And if left unchecked who is to say they won\u2019t find this place? Not to mention these assholes worship a dark god. The last thing we need is for them to do is gather enough power to start summoning shit. Last thing we need is demons running around down here.\u201d You add.\n\nAs soon as you say that, everyone looks at you and then also looks at Tanya who is also looking in your direction with her head cocked to the side almost intrigued by what you\u2019re going to say next.\n\n\u201cShhhhit...\u201d you quietly say which causes a snicker from Sneaks.\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t even address what you said she instead turns her attention back to Garrick.\n\n\u201cWord fumbling aside, he has a point Garrick. They all do. We can\u2019t ignore this potential threat any longer.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 (Sigh) I just don\u2019t want to lose any more people especially when we may need them in the future.\u201d Garrick says.\n\nAfter a brief moment of silence, Garrick speaks again.\n\n\u201cOkay, fine. Maybe we need to do something. The question is what exactly? I\u2019m still loathe to go all out gang war on a bunch of fanatics, because you know they\u2019re only going to hit back with more fervor\u2026maybe\u2026wait a minute. We could set it up so it looks like the Ebony Claw is targeting them. That will hopefully draw some heat off of us on both sides.\u201d Garrick says.\n\nGarrick begins to go into a plan to start ambushing the cultists, but also to ambush a few Ebony Claws and plant their bodies among the dead cultists so the living ones can stumble upon them and vice versa. In the meantime he says he\u2019s going to try to grease the right palms to gain some sort of meeting with Reginald and appear as an \u201cally\u201d against the Ebony Claw so Reginald will tell his people to leave the Guild alone.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad plan, though you\u2019re really not sure on the whole \u201callying\u201d with Reginald bit.\n\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure if this Reginald is ally material.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell we need to try, because if you haven\u2019t noticed, we are at a bit of a disadvantage. Reginald is Farrad\u2019s boyfriend. You know, the baron\u2019s son? The one who is probably going to attempt a coup on his father soon? If he\u2019s actually successful it\u2019s probably best that we\u2019re not on his bad side at least.\u201d Garrick retorts with annoyance.\n\u201cI can see that logic, but I still have concerns if allying with religious fanatics that participate in human sacrifice is a good idea. I mean hell, I\u2019d rather temporarily ally with the Ebony Claw against the cultists at this point\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a damn good thing that YOU don\u2019t have to make the fucking decisions isn\u2019t it then?!\u201d\n\nGarrick\u2019s sudden snap causes you to shut up immediately and everyone else to stand in silence. You certainly weren\u2019t expecting it, but then Garrick in general has been less than friendly with you, as your time in the Guild proper has come about. He\u2019s certainly nowhere near like he was when he first offered his hand to you in joining.\n\nYou have some theories about why, but for now you just answer:\n\n\u201cYour call. Apologies.\u201d\n\nGarrick gives you a dirty look and starts assigning tasks to people. He doesn\u2019t give one to you though.\n\nAs everyone starts to leave, you go up to Tanya and offer to help her on her assignment and that\u2019s when you get a scolding voice again.\n\n\u201cHey! Leave her be.\u201d Garrick orders.\n\u201cBut I was just\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted again.\n\u201cDid I assign you and Tanya to work together? No I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cGarrick, it\u2019s actually okay, I can\u2026\u201d Tanya says before Garrick interrupts her as well.\n\u201cStay out of this Tanya! Everyone get to work! Except YOU.\u201d\n\nTanya looks at you a little sympathetically as she leaves with the rest, which is definitely not the norm, and part of what you imagine is the problem Garrick is having with you.\n\nSoon it\u2019s just you and Garrick and he wastes no time in speaking.\n\n\u201cYou know when I brought you in, I thought you\u2019d be an asset to us. Sure you weren\u2019t exactly what I normally look for, but your actions against the Ebony Claw couldn\u2019t be ignored. Your ongoing work to prove yourself worthy of becoming one of the inner circle couldn\u2019t be ignored. Granted, I was still a little hesitant at the time since I was starting to have some doubts since so many thought you should continue to prove yourself, but Tanya\u2019s words in your favor\u2026well those couldn\u2019t be ignored either.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cI also can\u2019t ignore how you look at her and more importantly how she looks at you.\u201d Garrick says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she looks at me with anything but scorn.\u201d You say in an effort to deflect.\n\u201cBullshit. Maybe at one time she did. Not anymore. You\u2019re not so stupid to not realize that. Hell, she tried to speak up for you just now. I don\u2019t know HOW you did it, but you\u2019ve actually been getting through that normally solid brick wall she puts up to shield herself again all would be suitors. I have seen MANY try and while I imagine that she leaves a lasting impression due to her nature, I have seen NONE continue to pursue her, or those that have, have met with physical violence that either put a definite stop to it. Somehow you have miraculously avoided that. Somehow YOU have defied what shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d\n\nYou continue to stand there and say nothing, which only causes Garrick to throw something at you, which you narrowly dodge.\n\n\u201cWELL? Aren\u2019t you going to say anything?!\u201d Garrick shouts.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say. Anything I say, you\u2019re not going to like.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell permission to speak fucking freely then.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well I don\u2019t see how this is any of your concern. Tanya, from what I can tell is a full grown woman that\u2019s MORE than capable of taking care of herself and dealing with the likes of me. And as far as I know, you\u2019re not her father either even if you see her as some sort of surrogate daughter.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2026it doesn\u2019t make sense! WHY YOU?! There have been FAR better suitors in the past!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean like you?\u201d\n\u201cW\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on! I think given your increasing hostility towards me this is going beyond a father-daughter type of protectiveness. You\u2019re acting like a jealous boyfriend or something. I\u2019m succeeding where you and so many others obviously failed.\u201d\n\nGarrick just starts shaking his head.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2026I never\u2026I never\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe I\u2019m succeeding in something you never had the guts to do at all? That\u2019s it isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve never made any sort of advance on her, and just admired her from afar since you were always secure in the fact that she always drove everyone away. I\u2019m guessing perhaps you thought one day Tanya would come to you of her own accord and\u2026\u201d\n\nNow Garrick lifts up the table and flips it at you. For an older guy, he\u2019s certainly fit.\n\n\u201cYou think you know everything don\u2019t you? Well let me tell you something, you don\u2019t know shit. YOU are still a BOY and YOU are not worthy of Tanya.\u201d Garrick says getting in your face.\n\n\u201cOkay. Then what would make me worthy\u2026in your eyes?\u201d you ask.\n\nGarrick starts laughing.\n\n\u201cAre\u2026are you actually asking me? You seem to have all the answers, you figure it out. But while you\u2019re trying to figure it out, go do what you\u2019re actually good at and go kill our enemies. GO! Get the fuck outta my sight!\u201d\n\nYou leave Garrick and exit the meeting room somewhat expecting there to be a few people hanging around outside listening to the conversation, but it would appear that nobody wanted to be around for Garrick\u2019s anger to be directed towards them as well. Not even Sneaks lingered behind.\n\nSince you didn\u2019t even get paired up with a full fledged Guild member, you suppose you could just go gather a few associates to help you, though you believe you\u2019re probably more than capable of performing the task yourself.\n\nHonestly though, you\u2019re ready to just dispense with the plan and do something else instead like try to kill Reginald. Those assholes have been targeting you anyway. Also seems like it would solve the problem a lot better than trying to be friends with him. Cutting off the head of a cult usually results in it falling apart. The problem of course is he isn\u2019t as easy to get to anymore. The secret passage to his home no longer exists as one person in the Guild soon learned when he tried to break in that way thinking that it would be an easy job and nearly got himself killed in the process. If there\u2019s another secret passage to the house, you have no idea where it is and it\u2019s probably better protected now.\n\nWhich would mean a more traditional approach, but again, he\u2019s got security up the ass and has his own personal retinue of guards around his home. Perks of fucking minor nobility you suppose.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019d be doing this alone though because nobody would help you in this task. Say what you want about Garrick, but everyone listens to him and this would definitely be going against his plans.\n\nThough you do have another option, and that\u2019s going to the Ebony Claw Syndicate for help. Rook called off the hit and so far other than a few unavoidable skirmishes here and there, the EC has not been actively targeting you.\n\nYou never thought you\u2019d feel this way, but you\u2019ve actually considered joining them lately mainly because things have been just so miserable in the Guild. If it weren\u2019t for Tanya, you probably would have done it already.\n\nRook has never followed up on your last meeting, you don\u2019t know exactly what his game is, but you imagine if you come in for help, he\u2019s going to want that inside information on the Guild.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Reginald yourself", "result": "As much as you\u2019ve been toying with the idea, you\u2019re still not quite sure about throwing your lot in with the EC yet. You\u2019re walking a pretty traitorous line as it is just by not telling anyone that they ever approached you, but then it isn\u2019t like you can exactly tell them, can you?\n\nKilling Reginald is going to take some scouting and planning. As far as you know the man is rarely ever leaving his house anymore or if he is, he\u2019s not seen doing it.\n\nSince you\u2019re not exactly getting any further with Tanya at the moment, Garrick\u2019s pissed at you and you\u2019re essentially doing your own thing, you might as well stay somewhere other than the Guild while you do this. You head to Hell\u2019s Own Inn since it\u2019s at least some place that you know and can consider hospitable.\n\nBruno, the innkeeper nods when he sees you. Funny how you never really learned his name until after you stopped living here on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cHey Bruno, I\u2019ll have a room. My old one if it\u2019s currently available.\u201d You say.\n\u201cA room? Thought you were living in the Guild quarters ever since they let you into inner circle.\u201d Bruno says.\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019ve got something I need to do on my own and I can\u2019t be creeping in and out of sewers to do it. Where\u2019s Yinen, I might have a few things to trade with him.\u201d\n\u201cYinen? Haven\u2019t seen him in days.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him? He practically never leaves this place.\u201d\n\u201cI know, which is why it\u2019s weird that I didn\u2019t even see him leave. Unless he left in the middle of the night, but none of the staff saw him leave either.\u201d\n\u201cNobody has thought to look into this?\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I going to do, call the Holgard Watch?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but we could at least get somebody from the Guild or even one of the associates to look in on this. I mean he\u2019s one of our best fences. Seems like for all the Guild\u2019s talk of solidarity, they\u2019re dropping the ball on this one.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been gone THAT long. I figured maybe he had a special delivery or deal to take care of elsewhere. If he\u2019s gone for much longer I guess one of the associates can go look for him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Warts? He tends to not have much to do.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been gone longer than Yinen. Though I think in his case he\u2019s deliberately staying away. Last thing he mentioned to me is that bad things are going to happen here soon and he doesn\u2019t want to be around when they do. Can\u2019t say as I blame him either. I\u2019m still surprised this place hasn\u2019t gotten hit yet by the Ebony Claw. What the hell is Garrick doing about them anyway? Because as far as I can tell, they\u2019re not dropping in presence.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, we\u2019ve been taking the fight to them, but the rumors are that they\u2019re getting reinforcements from the Delantium Kingdom. Also, we\u2019ve been having problems with cultists running around in the sewers.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been reading about a couple of brutal murders in the paper that are thought to be the work of Neroth cultists. Actually, maybe that explains Yinen\u2019s disappearance. He always was a little nervous when it came to anything relating to Neroth. Maybe he took off like Warts did.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe so. I feel like he might have told someone first. Guess he might have been really scared though.\u201d\n\u201cIn any case, you\u2019re in luck. Your old room is available, but I\u2019ll be needing some rent for it. Business is a little slow what with not many folks coming to visit the city as much now.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? (Sigh) Fine. Whatever. Here, take this, but not a silver more.\u201d\n\nBruno takes your payment and you head to your old room. You take a quick inventory of your equipment and make plans to go case Reginald\u2019s home, but then you hear noise outside and a quick peek out your window reveals that the Holgard Watch are putting down a group of dissidents and decide to stay put for a little while.\n\nThat\u2019s been a more common sight too nowadays. Even on your way here, you were trying to avoid getting caught up the various groups of protesters that have been more frequent. Part of you wonders if Warts doesn\u2019t have the right idea, but at this point you\u2019ve got a few loose ends that need to be tied up first.\n\nOne of which is killing the head of this cult that\u2019s been trying to kill you. It\u2019s odd that you feel so strongly about this given that the EC was trying to kill you for years, but then maybe that\u2019s because you knew the EC was an enemy that from you can gather is much bigger than you could ever hope to fight. You consider it a victory that you even managed to get them to stop attacking you though you know you\u2019re going to have to deal with them again eventually. You just don\u2019t know how yet.\n\nThese fanatics however, there\u2019s a limit to their power for now. Right now they\u2019ve grown and if left unchecked, who knows, they may take over the city. Sure you could flee and maybe you\u2019d be fine. But you might also be running for the rest of your life as cults tend to not be satisfied with staying in one place and love to spread. Add their desire to summon demons and such into that mix and it might be best to nip this in the bud right now.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how you never really used to think that far ahead before, but you suppose you\u2019ve seen and done a lot since your simple days in Teckleville.\n\n\u201cCertainly hope you\u2019re having an easier time of it than I am sis.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nOver the course of the next three days you make visits to Reginald\u2019s home and spend hours watching the place. You never see anyone come in or out of the place though. Indeed, you\u2019ve never seen Reginald at all except from descriptions of him. Holgard Watch patrols the grounds night and day, but you don\u2019t see them ever enter the home either. You wonder if they even know what\u2019s going on in there or more likely they do, but don\u2019t care.\n\nEventually you spend an entire day and night on a nearby rooftop watching the place, hoping that you\u2019ll see him come out. He never does though. In your state of weariness, you barely react in time to hear someone approaching.\n\n\u201cYou can put that away, it\u2019s just me. Glad to see you\u2019re more alert than you appear though.\u201d Tanya says when you spin around pointing your pistol at her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here? I sort of thought if anyone was going to check up on me, it would be Sneaks.\u201d You say putting your weapon down.\n\u201cHah, like you\u2019d get him to climb up on rooftops, let alone jumping from them nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cGuess you\u2019re right. So what do you want?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I want? No comments about my beauty? No flirty statements? If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you\u2019d finally shaken off the effects. So you must be in a really shitty mood.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? You\u2019ve made it quite clear you\u2019re not interested and others have also made it quite clear as well, so why bother beating my head up against a wall?\u201d\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t answer you immediately as your answer has caught her off guard a bit.\n\n\u201cWhat happened between you and Garrick after the meeting?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like nothing considering you\u2019re disobeying orders. It seems to me you\u2019re trying to figure out a way to take out Reginald directly. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been spying on his house for the past few days.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s been spying.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping track of what every main group is doing, don\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may, I thought the Guild was supposed to just be a loose alliance anyway and Garrick wasn\u2019t officially our boss. And if he isn\u2019t our boss, then that means I can do what the hell I want.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not exactly true.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m not following orders this time. And it\u2019s not ONLY because these fuckers have been targeting me. These Neroth cultists are a bigger danger than the EC. Maybe they haven\u2019t been fucking with us as long, but if their leader or high priest or whatever is fucking the Baron\u2019s son then who is to say their goal isn\u2019t to turn the city into a theocracy? If something like that happens I can bet that there won\u2019t be any freedom to do anything here and they certainly aren\u2019t going to be dealing with the likes of us and quite frankly Garrick\u2019s an idiot if he believes he can somehow reason with them on some level, I\u2019ve seen what the hell they do.\u201d\n\u201cI see your point, but I somewhat understand his logic for attempting to make an alliance. However he\u2019s relying on something that I already told him isn\u2019t going to make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell you said it yourself. They worship a dark god and are probably trying to summon infernal beings if they haven\u2019t done so already. I believe Garrick thinks that having me by his side if he ever got to meet with Reginald, would help since y\u2019know\u2026being half infernal and all.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Didn\u2019t consider that. Would that work?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not. I even told Garrick as much when he first approached me about the plan earlier. At best Reginald might temporarily ally in an effort to separate me from the rest of the Guild and probably attempt to convince me to join them and embrace my heritage or some shit. I don\u2019t even like\u2026my condition. Last thing I want to do is embrace it. Already had to deal with that once before, don\u2019t feel like dealing with it again.\u201d\n\u201cDeal with it again?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and we\u2019re not talking about it. In any case, I\u2019m here to help you in your plan, because I believe you\u2019re completely right about this. These cultists need to be destroyed and taking their leader out will at least severely lessen their power.\u201d\n\nYou nod silence and with a somewhat uplifted spirit.\n\n\u201cThanks. I didn\u2019t expect any help, least of all from you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re on the same side aren\u2019t we? However, I do think YOU should get some rest before we attempt this. So you head back to Hells Own, get some sleep and tomorrow night, you and I will meet up outside here. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to talk to Sneaks and few others to see if I can\u2019t get them to make a bit of extra distraction for Neroth\u2019s most loyal. I\u2019m not going to let too many in on this plan though for obvious reasons.\u201d Tanya remarks.\n\u201cGood idea, again thanks. I really appreciate this.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well off you go. We\u2019ve got a big night tomorrow so be prepared as much as you can.\u201d\n\nYou bid Tanya goodbye who just nods an acknowledgment and leaves. Since you\u2019ve got your orders to rest, you climb down from your spot and head back to the inn.\n\nYou get a couple of blocks and suddenly you feel like you\u2019re being watched. You start to look around, but nobody is around. You quicken your pace and a couple seconds later, you feel a crossbow in your back.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around. Alley. Now.\u201d A familiar voice says.\n\nOnce again you obey the man with the crossbow and enter the nearby alley where once again, you see Rook.\n\n\u201cGlad we could meet again.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I ever had a choice.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cNot true! You could always choose to escape, I wouldn\u2019t bet on your chances, but you can\u2019t say you don\u2019t have a choice. You also have a choice to give me information on the location of the Thieves\u2019 Guild or not. I know for a fact you\u2019ve long been a member of their inner circle so you should have lots of information on the layout along with the location.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026I don\u2019t know ALL of the layout\u2026you see there was some debate about even letting me in, so they still don\u2019t trust me completely and as such they haven\u2019t allowed me full access.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. Just the location will do. It\u2019s not ideal, but I have more than enough confidence that we\u2019ll be able to take it anyway.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re silent. You can\u2019t think of anyway to lie or stall. It\u2019s either betray the Guild or die. You feel the crossbow still in your back, Rook inspects you as you struggle with the morality of this decision.\n\n\u201cTell me, why do you hesitate? Do you have close friends in the Guild? I can only imagine that the answer is yes, because if the answer was no, you would be spilling your guts right now. In fact, you probably would have done so on our first meeting. It\u2019s obvious you have no real love for the organization itself because if you did, you wouldn\u2019t even be considering any of this in the first place. You would be a good little Guild soldier and tell me how you\u2019d never betray Garrick or the Guild. At which point I\u2019d stop wasting my time and kill you. So you must have emotional attachment to someone there. Tell me who it is, and perhaps an arrangement can be made.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cWhat sort of arrangement?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe Ebony Claw doesn\u2019t like to waste potential talent. Or at least I don\u2019t, hence why we\u2019re having this pleasant conversation. If you can convince your friend or friends to join you in seeing that the future is the Ebony Claw, then I have no problem with them joining as well. Quite frankly, we\u2019ll probably need the manpower.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2026\u201d\n\nRook interrupts you and you realize you\u2019ve already given away too much.\n\n\u201cShe? Oh wait\u2026.\u201d Rook chuckles. \u201cOf course. It\u2019s her isn\u2019t it? Garrick\u2019s little demonkin. This explains everything! Did you fall in love with her?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! You poor silly enchanted fool! She\u2019s half succubus you know. That\u2019s why you\u2019re all fucked up and not thinking straight. Why I\u2019ll bet if it wasn\u2019t for her charming everyone, Garrick wouldn\u2019t have half the people in his Guild.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t enchant me! In fact she doesn\u2019t even like using her powers like that!\u201d you say getting agitated and temporarily forgetting that you\u2019re at Rook\u2019s mercy.\n\u201cOh of course she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s all part of her act. The puritanical demon seductress. Gets everyone hot an bothered and keeps them on a string by not actually putting out. How better to control the average man? I\u2019ll tell you what, we could use someone like her in the EC. Would make things easier to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything, while Rook continues to chuckle.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you a little more time because you seem to believe that yours is true love. If you do manage to convince the demonkin to join though, well that will just prove I was right in seeing your potential. However, I can\u2019t walk away from this meeting without nothing, so I still need you to do something for me or at least provide some sort of information.\u201d Rook responds.\n\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, you tell me. A plan of some sort perhaps. I\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s important enough or not.\u201d\n\nCurrently the Guild doesn\u2019t have any plans other than the one involving the Neroth worshippers and making it look like the EC are attacking them. The only other plan you can tell Rook is your plan directly against Reginald, you just aren\u2019t sure Rook\u2019s going to find that one important enough and you\u2019ll end up having give out the Guild\u2019s plan anyway.", "action_results": [{"action": "Give away the Guild\u2019s plan", "result": "Rook might be testing you to see if you\u2019ll lie to him or not. You\u2019d rather not take that chance so you better just come clean now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mounting an attack on the Neroth cultists because they\u2019ve been fucking with us. More specifically, we\u2019re mounting an attack on the Neroth cultists and going to make it look like Syndicate did it. We\u2019re also going try to ally with them, though to be honest that\u2019s the shit part of the plan.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI see. Well that is a very important bit of information. I thank you for telling me, though it would have been more impressive if I didn\u2019t have to initially pull it from you. No matter, give me the details and how you\u2019re involved exactly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m doing my own thing because I\u2019m not really into Garrick\u2019s plan in the first place. The Neroth cultists have been targeting me specifically longer than they\u2019ve been fucking with the Guild, so I was going to just go take out Reginald and be done with it.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. To be honest those Neroth worshipping assholes DO need to be dealt with. While some in the Ebony Claw don\u2019t consider them top priority, I see them as a potential problem in the future. Especially since we\u2019ve started to have our own run ins with them. Though I may be a bit biased considering they did kidnap my cousin once. Oh, by the way, always meant to thank you for rescuing her.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026you mean\u2026Naji is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA whore that doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing with her life, but she\u2019s still my cousin and she should finally get a little justice. This city already has more than enough gods competing, and as a dedicated disciple to Fel, I see no reason why I shouldn\u2019t aid directly in their fall. Consider the Holgard Watch taken care of by tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, really?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Obviously you\u2019re still going to have to kill Reginald and whatever fanatics he has in the house with him, but the Holgard Watch? They can always change loyalties and those that can\u2019t, well they\u2019ll be dealt with. Consider this another favor from your friends at the Ebony Claw.\u201d\n\nYou silently acknowledge Rook\u2019s words. While this is certainly going to help you out, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re going to be able to afford all these \u201cfavors\u201d when it comes time to pay up.\n\n\u201cWell then I guess this concludes our business again. I suppose I\u2019ll be sending some of my people to start actively hunting down groups of Guild members based on the information you told me. Next time we see each other though, I trust you\u2019ll have that other vital information for me. Time is growing short you know, and I would hate to see you on the wrong side.\u201d Rook says and pats you hard on the side of your face a couple times before walking away.\n\nYou soon no longer feel the crossbow at your back and that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s okay to move again.\n\nYou make your way back to the inn where you\u2019re supposed to be getting some rest like Tanya suggested, but after your encounter with Rook, you\u2019re more wound up than ever. Eventually you do fall asleep and by the time you wake up, it\u2019s night and you\u2019re rushing to go meet Tanya.\n\nWhen you get the place you were going to meet you find that she\u2019s not there. You wait around for awhile, but still no sign of her. You wonder if she changed her mind, then you wonder if she went in already because you also noticed that Reginald\u2019s house doesn\u2019t have the extra Holgard Watch security around it. (Rook was true to his word)\n\n\u201cShit, I hope not. I\u2019ve been standing around like a dumb ass if that\u2019s the case.\u201d You mutter and rush back down to street level again. You open the gate (which the guards helpfully left unlocked) and go to the front door which you lockpick with ease. You\u2019d think even with the guards he would have gotten a better lock, but whatever makes your task easier.\n\nYou slowly walk into the dimly lit foyer with your weapon drawn. You search the downstairs cautiously and methodically, but don\u2019t find any one. In the back of your mind you wish this was just a simple breaking and entering job because you\u2019re seeing a lot fancy decoration and you\u2019re sure Reginald has more portable valuables laying around in a safe or something somewhere.\n\nStill no sign of Tanya. You begin to worry if something happened to her if she came here at all. It also crosses you mind that it\u2019s possible she got held up before coming here. Rook did say he was sending some of his people to go actively hunt Guild members. For all you know she ran afoul of one of those groups or had to help other Guild members.\n\nWhile you\u2019re looking around for stairs to the cellar, you hear some thumping coming from the upstairs. Things have been more or less silent so far, so this it cause to give you alarm.\n\nYou immediately head back to the large set of stairs that lead up in the foyer. As you\u2019re heading up the stairs, you notice that the lighting is becoming much darker. It\u2019s almost as if the candles from the chandelier are going out.\n\nYou get to near the top of the landing and then it goes completely dark. You then feel several hands grab at you You manage to fire off your pistol once before several hands take it from you.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d You say and begin to struggle.\n\u201cRestrain the unbeliever!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill him, this infidel must be properly sacrificed!\n\nSince you have no intention of going quietly, you fight your assailants. It\u2019s hard to see in the dark, but you\u2019re doing the best you can. Eventually you manage to get your arms free and draw your blade. You slash blindly, hitting someone before you try to make your way back downstairs.\n\nYou\u2019re half way down the stairs with footsteps and yelling not far behind. You then suddenly feel a force of a person grabbing and tackling you with abandon. The pair of you goes rolling down the stairs and don\u2019t stop until you hit the bottom.\n\nYou feel a sharp pain in your right leg when you try to move it. Doesn\u2019t take long before you realize it\u2019s broken. Your assailant was less lucky and managed to break his neck during the tumble down the stairs. That doesn\u2019t help you that much though since his body is partially holding you down and his buddies are already almost upon you.\n\n\u201cShit, he killed Daniel!\u201d\n\nGotta love the \u201coutrage\u201d by a bunch of demon worshippers, not to mention the fact that Daniel killed himself by tackling you in the first place!\n\nYou crawl the best you can from out under Daniel\u2019s body and swing your blade at anyone coming near, but it\u2019s no use. There are just too many and despite hacking a couple of them at the legs, they soon begin stomping and kicking you.\n\nThe best you can do is try to cover yourself until eventually one person tells them all to stop.\n\nYou raise your head and see a man with a goatee in a red robe. A couple of other larger men in red robes stand behind him. Granted everyone around you is wearing red, but it\u2019s obvious that this is the one you were looking for. This is Reginald.\n\nHe motions the others to pick you up which they do despite you struggling and the agony of a broken leg.\n\nReginald walks towards you.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve returned. I know you\u2019re the one that so rudely broke into my home and stole that girl years ago. We were a little pre-occupied in nabbing you before and you seem to be skilled enough to fight off our recent attempts. Not sure why you stupidly decided to believe you could get away with walking in here alone again, but you\u2019ll soon learn that was a very grave mistake. Going to have something very special planned for you.\u201d\n\nBefore you can answer with some sort of defiant reply, two of the red robed assholes holding you go down to throwing daggers in their faces from above! Of course this also means you fall to the floor as well since your leg is broken and you can\u2019t stand.\n\nIt\u2019s still dark, but even from your prone position and in your one eye that hasn\u2019t closed shut you can see a figure running about on the second floor balcony and throwing more daggers. It has to be Tanya.\n\n\u201cDamnit, it\u2019s a full on assault! Take this asshole to the dungeons, the rest of you get whoever that is and be on the look out for others!\u201d Reginald orders.\n\nSeveral cultists try to pick you up again, but you do everything you can to prevent them from doing so. Eventually you get walloped and kicked in the head enough times that you\u2019re unable to do much of anything except struggle to stay conscious.\n\nYou\u2019re dragged across the floor and down some steps while the chaos of shouting and running is around you.\n\nEventually you no longer feel a wooden floor but cold stone. As you are continually dragged across the cellar area, you are now starting to black out. Your only thoughts are that you hope Tanya will be okay and save your ass on top of everything else.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the last thoughts you ever have. The cultists dragging you to the dungeon cell aren\u2019t exactly being the most gentle and your already battered head takes a few more hits, then when they throw you in the cell, they give you a couple more kicks as well. You don\u2019t feel the pain any longer since you\u2019re unconscious by this point.\n\nIt\u2019s just as well that you soon die from internal head trauma since Tanya isn\u2019t even successful in retrieving your body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Give away your own plan", "result": "You\u2019re pretty much fucked either way, but you\u2019re going to gamble that Rook will be satisfied with revealing your plan, with some embellishments of course.\n\n\u201cGarrick sent me on a mission to kill Reginald.\u201d\n\u201cThe cult leader that seduced his way into high society? Interesting.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the Neroth cult is getting out of hand and the Guild is having severe problems with them so I was ordered to take out the leader. Been spending a few days staking out his home in an effort to figure out the best approach, but he\u2019s got guards every fucking where.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I see. To be honest those Neroth worshipping assholes DO need to be dealt with. While some in the Ebony Claw don\u2019t consider them top priority, I see them as a potential problem in the future. Especially since we\u2019ve started to have our own run ins with them. Though I may be a bit biased considering they did kidnap my cousin once. Oh, by the way, always meant to thank you for rescuing her.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026you mean\u2026Naji is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA whore that doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing with her life, but she\u2019s still my cousin and she should finally get a little justice. So while normally I would love to see two enemies kill each other and making things a lot easier for us, it would be best if the followers of Neroth were curtailed. This city already has more than enough gods competing, and as a dedicated disciple to Fel, I see no reason why I shouldn\u2019t aid directly in their fall. Consider the Holgard Watch taken care of by tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, really?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Obviously you\u2019re still going to have to kill Reginald and whatever fanatics he has in the house with him, but the Holgard Watch? They can always change loyalties and those that can\u2019t, well they\u2019ll be dealt with. Consider this another favor from your friends at the Ebony Claw.\u201d\n\nYou silently acknowledge Rook\u2019s words. While this is certainly going to help you out, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re going to be able to afford all these \u201cfavors\u201d when it comes time to pay up.\n\n\u201cWell then I guess this concludes our business again. Next time we see each other, I trust you\u2019ll have that vital information for me. Time is growing short you know, and I would hate to see you on the wrong side.\u201d Rook says and pats you hard on the side of your face a couple times before walking away.\n\nYou soon no longer feel the crossbow at your back and that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s okay to move again.\n\nYou make your way back to the inn where you\u2019re supposed to be getting some rest like Tanya suggested, but after your encounter with Rook, you\u2019re more wound up than ever. Eventually you do fall asleep and by the time you wake up, it\u2019s night and you\u2019re rushing to go meet Tanya.\n\nShe\u2019s of course on the rooftop where you were yesterday.\n\n\u201cI was expecting you here earlier, it\u2019s not like you to leave things at the last moment.\u201d Tanya remarks.\n\u201cI guess I was more tired than I thought.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI nearly went in before you, because a perfect opportunity just opened up ten minutes ago. All of the guards left.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAll of the guards just left. I saw a couple of them speak to each other and then one called to some of the others and they all just collectively left. I couldn\u2019t believe it myself. That\u2019s why I was hoping you\u2019d hurry up since who knows how long they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nWell looks like Rook wasn\u2019t a liar and he came through. Almost makes you start to wonder WHY he\u2019s being so helpful. He doesn\u2019t fit what you know about the EC at all. True, this is probably just all to get you to rat on the Guild, but it still seems above and beyond.\n\nOf course he might think now that you\u2019ll be able to talk Tanya into switching sides too. He didn\u2019t seem convinced you\u2019d be able to do it, but then maybe it\u2019s a small effort on his part for large potential gain.\n\nHonestly, you aren\u2019t even sure how or if you\u2019d ever be able to approach the subject with Tanya. As far as you know she\u2019s always been pretty dedicated to the Guild even if she\u2019s aloof to most of the members.\n\nBut this is a problem for another time; right now you\u2019ve got a cult priest to assassinate.\n\nTanya says she\u2019s still going with her original plan of leaping to the roof of the house and breaking in that way. You doubt if you could make it since the distance is a little farther than average, but then you aren\u2019t blessed with infernal blood allowing you to do shit like that. You say you\u2019re going to just go in the front door now that everyone is gone. Assuming he\u2019s not in the cellar or not there at all, you\u2019re guessing you\u2019ll be able to catch him upstairs or down.\n\nBesides the unknown factor of his location, there\u2019s also the unknown factor of what abilities he has or what else is in the house. At best you\u2019re hoping he\u2019s just some mouthpiece for bloodthirsty cult. At worst he\u2019s going to be summoning demons and have all sorts of other dark magic at his disposal.\n\nYou make your way down to street level again, open the gate (which the guards helpfully left unlocked) and go to the front door which you lockpick with ease. You\u2019d think even with the guards he would have gotten a better lock, but whatever makes your task easier.\n\nYou slowly walk into the dimly lit foyer with your weapon drawn. You search the downstairs cautiously and methodically, but don\u2019t find any one. In the back of your mind you wish this was just a simple breaking and entering job because you\u2019re seeing a lot fancy decoration and you\u2019re sure Reginald has more portable valuables laying around in a safe or something somewhere.\n\nWhile you\u2019re looking around for stairs to the cellar, you hear some thumping coming from the upstairs. Things have been more or less silent so far, so this it cause to give you alarm.\n\nYou immediately head back to the large set of stairs that lead up in the foyer. As you\u2019re heading up the stairs, you notice that the lighting is becoming much darker. It\u2019s almost as if the candles from the chandelier are going out.\n\nYou get to near the top of the landing and then it goes completely dark.\n\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d You say to yourself and immediately turn your head towards the direction of the chandelier.\n\nThen when you turn your head back forward, you nearly fall backwards when you see Tanya standing right in front of you.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d you utter out loud and then Tanya grabs your tunic so you don\u2019t fall.\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You say.\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge your gratitude though; instead she pulls you closer to her. At this distance, even in the darkness, you can make out her normally shrouded face.\n\nThe first time you saw it at this range you were partially enchanted. This time is no different, but you\u2019re still aware enough that this isn\u2019t normal behavior for her, especially in these circumstances.\n\n\u201cTanya?\u201d you utter.\n\nYou get no answer, what you do get is a kiss on your lips. The feeling is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s very pleasant, but as it goes on, you start to feel weak. In fact you try to pull away, but when you do so, Tanya\u2019s eyes glow red, she makes a growling sound and then shoves your away.\n\nYou tumble down the stairs and while you fortunately don\u2019t break anything, you unfortunately smack your head so hard you\u2019re dazed. If you could actually see anything in this darkness, you\u2019d probably be seeing double.\n\nYou hear a bunch of footsteps and then you feel a couple sets of hands lifting you up and finally a fist coming straight at your face.\n\nWhen you wake up, you\u2019re in a cell, completely naked. A brief look at your surroundings and you know exactly where you are. It\u2019s the torture chamber where you saved Naji. In fact, you\u2019re in the exact same cell.\n\nYou look around, but there\u2019s nothing in your cell that you find useful, you do notice that there is someone else in the next cell over. They\u2019re sitting in a corner rocking back and forth mumbling. While the person has obviously been through hell and you\u2019ve definitely never seen this person naked before, the face and hair are still recognizable despite some of the fresh wounds. You can hardly believe it.\n\n\u201cYinen?\u201d you ask.\n\nYinen briefly looks at you and while he knows who you are, he returns to his rocking and mumbling. You can\u2019t even tell what he\u2019s saying, but he sounds like he saying something religious. You hear Joachim\u2019s name being mentioned a few times.\n\nWell this explains where Yinen has been. Poor bastard\u2019s probably been tortured for quite awhile. You still don\u2019t know what happened with Tanya either. Was a spell cast on her? She is half succubus, was the \u201cpresence of Neroth\u201d forcing her to act more within her nature?\nYou don\u2019t know, but what you do know is you need to get the hell out of here.\n\nYou\u2019re not filled with confidence that you\u2019re going to survive whatever is to come, but you sure hope whatever they have planned its quick.\n\nGrabing a hold of the door in a vain attempt to open it and feeling a little hopeless yourself, you say your own prayer though yours is more along the lines of \u201cI sure hope Yag is throwing a seven for me tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, prayer! The last refuge of a scoundrel as they say. I\u2019ve always disagreed with that though. Prayer can be a powerful tool. I should know as my dark father has blessed me with much since my dedicated prayer to him.\u201d A voice says.\n\nYou turn your head and see a man with a goatee in a red robe. A couple of other larger men in red robes stand behind him.\n\n\u201cHowever I think you shall find that your prayers will go unanswered here. Neroth holds complete sway as he soon will over this city and eventually the world!\u201d\n\nGiven his superior attitude and boasting, you can only imagine this is Reginald. He gives you a look that reminds you of that fat perverted merchant you had to kill years ago. You instinctively cover yourself.\n\n\u201cOh we have a shy one do we? I must say, you shouldn\u2019t be, given your body. However, as much as I would love to throw you over the altar in front of my congregation and introduce my dick to your ass while slitting your throat as I released, I\u2019ve got something better planned for you.\u201d Reginald remarks.\n\u201cHope its better than ass rape.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHah. Depends on your viewpoint I suppose. I know you\u2019re the one that so rudely broke into my home and stole that girl years ago. We were a little pre-occupied in nabbing you before and you seem to be skilled enough to fight off our recent attempts. However when you walked in here of your own accord, and with that infernal spawn\u2026well that almost makes up for all the years you were able to go on breathing.\u201d\n\nReginald motions the two large men to open the cell door. You back up ready to fight, though Reginald shakes his head and makes some gestures with his hand and your body completely tenses up like you\u2019re paralyzed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for that, important work must be done. That half-breed you walked in with has only begun to realize the untapped potential of her powers. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how she has managed to suppress her infernal side for so long. Most daughters of true succubi by her age have long since gone on to embrace their infernal heritage. This one was obviously lost, but no more.\u201d Reginald says.\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d you ask as the two men grab your arms and start dragging you out.\n\u201cMe? I did nothing other than speak a few truths to her guided by Neroth\u2019s wisdom, though as I said, his presence in this house is stronger than most. I believe she felt it, just as all who follow do. However, she\u2019s still not complete, that\u2019s where you will come in. She will complete her transformation with you as the sacrifice and we will ALL witness it, and it shall be glorious to see a higher being achieve freedom!\u201d\n\nReginald motions the two men to drag you to the room with the altar and large pentagram on the floor. When you enter, you\u2019re thrown into said pentagram. A crowd of red robed individuals watches silently.\n\nWhen you get your head up off the floor, the paralysis is wearing off, but now you see Tanya in front of you looking at you like a predator with its prey. She definitely doesn\u2019t seem like herself.\n\n\u201cDaughter of Neroth! Embrace your true heritage and kill this sacrifice in the name of your dark father! We shall all bask in the glory of your transformation!\u201d Reginald shouts followed by several of his followers.\n\nYou manage to stand up, but you doubt if you\u2019re going to be much match for Tanya. Even if you weren\u2019t naked and unarmed, you probably wouldn\u2019t be a match.\n\nDespite the fact that death is most likely imminent, you\u2019ve still got this unnatural attraction to Tanya, or rather genuine attraction, but unnatural due to the situation at hand.\n\nThis is really looking like the end for you, unless you can come up with something.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to reason with Tanya", "result": "You\u2019d never be able to take her in a fight, your only chance is talk your way out of this.

These people are trying to control you!\u201d you say.\n\nTanya however isn\u2019t responsive; she just approaches in a seductive way that is making it very hard for you to focus on anything else except the obvious. Tanya moves closer to you and runs her fingers through your hair and then lifts your head up with one hand and puts another hand to her lips in a \u201cshhhhh\u201d motion. It\u2019s apparent she\u2019s toying with you like a cat would with a mouse.\n\n\u201cTanya, you\u2026have to remember\u2026\u201d you utter and then Tanya shuts you up with one of her kisses.\n\nYou can\u2019t resist. You embrace Tanya as she guides you down to the floor, still continuing to press her lips against yours. And once again you begin to feel the effects of her succubus kiss.\n\nTanya mounts you and begins grinding her body into yours. While it\u2019s everything you ever hoped it would be, a part of you still knows this is killing you. Meanwhile the chanting of the Neroth cultists grows louder.\n\n\u201cTanya\u2026\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t answer you, she just continues with her actions which are now beginning to get faster and rougher. Her eyes glow red once again and she slams your arms down to the floor. You can feel her talons digging into your flesh. The mixture of pain and pleasure is almost too much to handle.\n\nYou begin to feel very drained and dyhydrated. You gasp for Tanya to stop, but she doesn\u2019t. She has now taken on a less human looking appearance and the noises she\u2019s making definitely aren\u2019t loving moans of ecstasy.\n\n\u201cDAUGHTER OF NEROTH FINISH OFF THIS INFIDEL AND EMBRACE YOUR TRUE NATURE AT LAST!\u201d Reginald shouts above the rest of the chanting.\n\nTanya looks down at you and even in your hazy condition you no longer see any glimpse of the girl you knew in her eyes any longer.

It\u2019s apparent she\u2019s toying with you like a cat would with a mouse, but something about it is very alluring. So much so that you almost forget to punch her right in the face.\n\nThis is more than enough to surprise her and cause her reel back a bit. You immediately look around for a way to escape. However the crowd is converging on you, including Reginald, but he\u2019s instead telling everyone to back off.\n\n\u201cNo! Let her finish him off! His impotent fighting will only prolong the inevitable and make her transformation all the more sweeter as she will tear him apart with no mercy!\u201d he shouts.\n\nBy this point Tanya has recovered and with how pissed she looks right now Reginald may be right on that last part.\n\nYou stand your ground with your fists up, and Tanya runs towards you. You throw another punch, but she dodges and gives you a swift punch to your stomach and knocks all the wind out of you. Now while you\u2019re hunched over trying to catch your breath, she grabs your throat with one hand and your balls with the other.\n\nJust as you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re going to be soon singing soprano, something unexpected happens. Instead of crushing your manhood, she instead lifts you up over her head, not that this isn\u2019t still painful of course.\n\nBut the next thing she does is even more unexpected.\n\nInstead of slamming you into the floor or something similar she instead throws you at Reginald who is taken completely off guard by this.\n\n\u201cWha fuck!\u201d he utters before you go crashing into him.\n\nWith you and Reginald on the floor, the congregation is now really getting agitated. Those two large cultists that dragged you from the cell immediately go to get you off of Reginald, but before they can, you hear grunts and howls of pain as Tanya has stabbed them both.\n\nBlood has now sprayed all over the place and you feel the crushing weight of a dead body falling on you.\n\n\u201cYou and that half breed bitch will pay for this! Kill them both!\u201d Reginald shouts.\n\nReginald isn\u2019t exactly in the best position to give any orders however as he\u2019s in an even worse position than you since he\u2019s now buried under two bodies rather than just yours. He struggles to get his arms free and while you\u2019re trying to do the same you get another idea.\n\nYour head is at his chest level right now, and mustering all your strength you manage to move your entire body forward and slam the top of your head up into his jaw repeatedly. He tries to stop you, but he still can\u2019t get his arms entirely free.\n\nYou\u2019re naked and you\u2019ve got one dead man on top of you and you\u2019re currently rubbing up against another one trying kill you, if someone had told you that you\u2019d ever be in this situation you never would have believed it.\n\nEventually you break his jaw causing him to moan and wail, or at least the best he can do with a broken jaw.\n\nYou take the opportunity to roll sideway and wiggle out from under the dead cultist. You catch a few short punches to your side, but you eventually get free. Reginald despite being in pain begins to do likewise.\n\nWasting no time, you take advantage of his still prone position and use the heel of your foot to bring it down on Reginald\u2019s nose. If you didn\u2019t break it the first time, you certainly do the second. By the third and forth time you\u2019ve stomped it into mush.\n\nYour balls still ache, the top of your head is sore, your foot hurts like hell and you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ve got a bone fragment in it, but Reginald is currently choking on his own blood and struggling to breath with a mashed up nose and broken jaw so you\u2019re currently doing much better than he is.\n\nYou take his head and start smashing it as hard as you can on the stone floor. Reginald tries to feebly stop you, but he\u2019s too weak at this point and with the back of his skull being caved in and his brains starting to leak out of his head he soon loses consciousness forever.\n\nAfter finishing the bloody deed, you take a moment to catch your breath. You finally get a chance to be more aware of your surroundings and see Tanya has been making short work of the remaining cultists that have still stuck around. After finishing off the last cultist she turns to face you and once again you\u2019re still a little concerned about as you have no idea if she\u2019s actually still on your side again or she just decided to go on killing rampage.\n\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there with a stupid look on your face, we need to get the hell out here and at least take a robe off of one of these assholes and put it on. I\u2019ve seen way more of you than I ever wanted to!\u201d\n\nShe appears to be back to normal.\n\n\u201cWait a minute, what the hell happened to you a few moments ago? In fact what the hell happened to you period?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to talk about it, look we need to get the fuck outta here. I don\u2019t like it here and I don\u2019t\u2026feel right just being here. We need to fucking go NOW.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, shit\u2026robe\u2026robe\u2026\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re stripping off a robe of one of the corpses, Tanya\u2019s looking around as if she\u2019s expecting more trouble. While that might very well be the case, you can tell it\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cShit! Yinen! He\u2019s still in the fucking cage back there, we need to let him out.\u201d You say as you\u2019re putting on the robe.\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t have the damn keys and we don\u2019t have time to search all these fuckers.\u201d Tanya exclaims.\n\u201cWell I\u2019d pick the lock, but it\u2019s not like I have a lockpick anymore, do you have any?\u201d\n\u201cHere, but hurry the hell up I\u2019m not sticking around here any longer than I have to.\u201d\n\nYou catch the lockpick that Tanya tosses at you and run back to the torture chamber. You go back to Yinen\u2019s cell and start opening the cell, but he just continues to do the usual rocking back and forth and mumbling.\n\n\u201cYinen! Come on! We gotta get the hell out of here! Yinen!\u201d you say and approach him.\n\nYinen finally realizes someone is there with him, but instead of jumping at the chance to be free, he starts screaming.\n\n\u201cNO! NO! I WON\u2019T GO WITH YOU! GET AWAY! PLEASE! JOACHIM SAVE ME!\u201d\n\nAt first you\u2019re confused to as why he\u2019s acting this way and doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s you, but then you think it might be the fact that you\u2019re wearing a red robe.\n\n\u201cYinen! It\u2019s me! I\u2019m not one of them! I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNO! LIES! NEROTH IS THE FATHER OF LIES AND EVIL! JOACHIM! BRING DOWN YOUR HOLY VENGENCE AND SAVE ME!\u201d Yinen shouts and suddenly lunges at you.\n\nYou fend off his attack in an effort not to hurt him too badly, but he isn\u2019t so much interested in fighting as he is escaping. He runs off yelling after he manages to maneuver around you. You hear Tanya shout something in the next room and you run back to her.\n\n\u201cWas that him? He ran right past me screaming.\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cYeah, I dunno, the guy\u2019s head is all fucked up. They really did something to him, I dunno if he\u2019s going to be the same.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one, now WE need to leave.\u201d\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t wait any longer, she runs into the room with all the wine barrels and you follow as close as possible. You\u2019d suggest looking for the passage to the sewers for a quicker exit, but you aren\u2019t even sure if it exists anymore, besides she\u2019s already made her way up the stairs to the ground floor.\n\nYinen must have known the way out since the door is already open, or rather the hidden bookshelf door that was hiding the stairs to the cellar. From here, you both make your way out the house (And again, find the door already open)\n\nYou don\u2019t exactly know where Tanya\u2019s running to, but you continue to follow her and eventually she stops somewhere secluded. Then she start going through her clothing.\n\n\u201cHere. Take this thing and leave me be.\u201d She says and hands you back your pistol. In all the ensuing mayhem you completely forgot that you had potentially lost your favorite weapon.\n\n\u201cThanks\u2026but where did you get this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI took it when they were stripping your clothes off, I dunno why I did. I really don\u2019t understand why I did anything. I thought I was past this. I need to get my head together and figure this shit out.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cTanya can you at least tell me something? I mean did Reginald case a spell or what? I mean was all his babbling true, Neroth is your father in some way?\u201d\n\u201cNo! And I\u2019m not just saying that because I don\u2019t want that to be true. I\u2019m saying that, because my real father from what my succubus bitch of a mother told me was some drunk dickhead that she killed immediately after mating with and because Reginald doesn\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019s talking about. While he may have been sucking Neroth\u2019s infernal cock in the spiritual sense, I still know more about the infernal realm more than he EVER could have and trust me, if he had known, he wouldn\u2019t have been worshipping Neroth or whatever petty infernal warlord that\u2019s setting himself up as a god to mortals at any given time.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019ve been there? You\u2019ve actually crossed into a different plane?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t need to physically be there and I hope I never do. I saw enough based on what my mother showed me and I resisted the lure of it then and I\u2019m going to continue to do so.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep bringing up your mother, I thought you were an orphan.\u201d\n\u201cI was. Wasn\u2019t like she took care of me, she tossed me aside as soon as I was born and I suppose I was lucky to be born female and she wasn\u2019t hungry at the time. Look, while I\u2019m sure this is all very intriguing for you, I am fucking done talking about this. If you want to know what happened to me, I don\u2019t fucking know! Maybe all the demonic ties that Reginald and by proxy his home had to the infernal realm had some effect and I lost control because I\u2019ve let my guard down to it over the years. I guess I was lucky that you punched me in the face to snap me out of it. Thanks, but just because you know some shit about me doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re getting closer!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBullshit! That\u2019s ALL you ever think about. I know you do. You can\u2019t even help yourself. Pfft, your earlier lie about not being interested me anymore when we were on the rooftop before all this happened was laughable. I know for a fact that you regularly have sex with some whore that tries to look like me. In fact isn\u2019t she the same one you saved? Boy you must LOVE that. It\u2019s almost like you can pretend that you saved me like some hero.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You embarrassed? You\u2019re not THAT embarrassed if you\u2019re still doing it. Besides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be the first, you just happen to be one of the few that\u2019s been doing it the longest.\u201d\n\u201cTanya, I really don\u2019t know what you want from me at this point. I mean I\u2019m really trying my best. I thought we were at least getting along.\u201d\n\u201cAnd THAT\u2019S a failing on my part. If anything I\u2019ve allowed you to get TOO close lately! I need to fucking redouble my efforts, I see that now. I should have known to keep my distance from you and I should have NEVER offered to help you on this task!\u201d\n\nYou can see this is a losing battle and you\u2019re tired so you decide to bow out.\n\n\u201cOk Tanya, you\u2019ve made your point, I\u2019m leaving. Thanks for saving me again, see you later.\u201d\n\nYou start to leave, but Tanya spins you around.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you turn your back on me, and this is for punching me in the fucking face!\u201d Tanya says and kicks you hard in the balls.\n\nYou crumple to the ground and Tanya starts to say something, but then stops and then starts again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry\u2026I just\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026 just stay away from me.\u201d She says and quickly runs off.\n\nAfter vomiting a little bit you eventually stand back up and stagger back to the Hell\u2019s Own Inn. Thankfully you aren\u2019t accosted by anyone along the way.\n\nWhen you get back, Bruno sees you and gives you a sideways glance at first.\n\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s you. I saw a red robe and got a little nervous. What\u2019s with the red robe anyway, aren\u2019t those the ones that Neroth cultists wear?\u201d Bruno asks.\n\u201cYeah, I just joined so you better watch out.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHa ha funny guy. What\u2019s the real story?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to even get into it right now, I\u2019ll tell you another time, I just want to go rest.\u201d\n\u201cSure, whatever.\u201d\n\nYou start making your way upstairs, but stop to ask one question.\n\n\u201cHey Bruno, Yinen didn\u2019t come in here by any chance did?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI told you, I haven\u2019t seen him in days. He probably left the city.\u201d Bruno says.\n\u201cI bet he wishes he did.\u201d You mumble and head to your room.\n\nYou take off the blood stained and rank red robe and collapse on your bed. You\u2019ve spent a lot of the night naked tonight, and not in a good way.\n\nThe only good thing about tonight is you killed the top asshole of the cult that was trying to kill you. You imagine there are still others around, but you can\u2019t worry about it right now.\n\nAs you slowly drift off with your hand covering your abused testicles, you think about how things are just fucked up with Tanya now. It\u2019s like you\u2019re back to square one, but maybe you were just deluding yourself anyway.\n\nOf course despite all this AND the fact that she tried to kill you today, you still go to sleep dreaming about her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 20\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not obsessed.\u201d You exclaim which causes a look of skepticism from Sneaks.\n\n\u201cOkay, maybe I\u2019m a little obsessed, but not in the way you\u2019re saying.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLook kid, I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, I\u2019ve jerked off thinking about Tanya too. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a man that\u2019s been in contact with her for any length of time that hasn\u2019t. Hell, there\u2019s been guys in the Guild into men and they STILL admitted to having thoughts about her. She had a dick of course in their fantasies, but my point is, she still had an effect. It\u2019s part of her demon heritage, but the effects should have long since worn off and I\u2019m telling you the way you\u2019re going is not fucking healthy.\u201d\n\u201cBut my feelings for her are not just physical. I mean yeah that\u2019s part of it, but I\u2019ve been getting to know her and I feel a real connection with her.\u201d\n\nNow Sneaks is totally confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you were staying away from her ever since you took out Reginald.\u201d Sneaks asks.\n\u201cI have! But I keep seeing her in my dreams! And those dreams have been becoming more frequent lately. In these dreams, we spend time together and talk and laugh and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd fuck. Probably a lot of fucking. Look, sounds like you\u2019re having some nice dreams, but dreams aren\u2019t real and with some of the ones you\u2019ve described they sound impossible. Just go back to fucking that whore that dresses like her, it\u2019s the closest you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t even do that anymore, I feel like I\u2019m cheating on Tanya. I\u2019m telling you, this is really happening. I don\u2019t know how, but it is. I mean don\u2019t succubi invade dreams? I mean maybe she\u2019s trying to tell me something even if she isn\u2019t doing it in the real world.\u201d\n\u201cReal world being the key word here. Are you listening to yourself? Look, I don\u2019t know what to tell you man, I mean\u2026(sigh) okay say for the sake of argument this IS all true, have you even spoken to her directly about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell no, I\u2019ve been trying to stay away and respect her wishes to leave her alone.\u201d\n\nSneaks slaps you upside the head.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s without a doubt, the stupidest fucking shit you\u2019ve ever said involving Tanya. I\u2019ve known you since you joined the Guild and you\u2019ve flirted with her shamelessly beyond a point where others have gotten shanked by her for their troubles. The ONLY other person I know who\u2019s gotten this obsessed with Tanya and lived is Garrick, though Yag knows he\u2019d NEVER fucking admit that.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cSo\u2026I was right about Garrick?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you were right about him. Why do you think he still holds a grudge against you even though you\u2019re staying away from Tanya? I mean in his case, I don\u2019t think it started out that way\u2026shit I HOPE it didn\u2019t start out that way since he took her in when she was a young teenager, but in any case. Garrick has been in love with Tanya for a very long time now. He\u2019ll never make a move of course, which is why I\u2019m telling YOU that if you REALLY think you\u2019ve got a shot with Tanya, then you need to just go talk to her, because the non-confrontational routine? Yeah that doesn\u2019t work and it isn\u2019t your style anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one that once told me once to forget about her?\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll listen to me on this advice this time because it\u2019s apparent that you\u2019re bound for a path of destruction. At least if you go talk to her you\u2019ll get that over quickly and who knows, maybe just MAYBE, you\u2019re right about all this. In any case, I\u2019m going to go see if there\u2019s anyone around to play cards with.\u201d\n\u201cI think a lot of the members are out enjoying the riots.\u201d\n\u201cYeah fuck that, it\u2019s absolute chaos out there. Surprised the Baron\u2019s managed to still keep control of some of the city. Mostly the merchant\u2019s district, rich areas and his palace of course, but it\u2019s getting worse. To be honest, I would leave the city, but unfortunately I\u2019ve still got a streak of loyalty and I\u2019d never just abandon Garrick. Too much history, even if I don\u2019t agree with him sometimes. Anyway, see you later and good luck.\u201d\n\nSneaks leaves you and you immediately go to see if Tanya is in her quarters. You already know what you\u2019re going to say, because you\u2019ve been saying it in your mind for a long time now, you\u2019re just mentally preparing yourself the verbal (and possibly physical) repercussions of your confrontation.\n\nHas to be done though because this has gone on long enough and if Tanya genuinely has no interest in you then you\u2019re not going to stick around just to have something you desire greatly dangling in front of you everyday and can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nAs you approach Tanya\u2019s quarters you hear voices coming from it. You slow your pace and strain your ears to listen and eventually hide just outside her door.\n\n\u201cTanya, I can throw him out of the Guild, if he\u2019s been bothering you again. Honestly I would have done it sooner had you not told me not to after that stunt with the Neroth cultists.\u201d You hear Garrick say.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been bothering me Garrick, if anything he\u2019s been honoring my wishes. He\u2019s been a perfect fucking gentleman\u2026or at least as close as he can get to one.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may, I know something is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Garrick, stop fussing.\u201d\n\u201cTanya, I KNOW something is going on with you. I\u2019ve known you since you were girl and I know when you\u2019re more troubled than usual. I mean if you don\u2019t tell me, I can\u2019t help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking right Garrick, you CAN\u2019T fucking help! Nobody can! So stop playing the over protective dad role trying to save his little girl and just get the hell out of my quarters.\u201d\n\u201cTanya, you forget that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, Garrick I fucking know. You brought me in off the streets when I was some poor dirty orphan stealing food and had run away from the home for the umpteenth time! How long are you going to bring that up? I\u2019ve never said I wasn\u2019t appreciative, I think my time staying here has proven that, but if you think I OWE you something more, then you\u2019ve been a fool for a longer time than even he has! Worse even.\u201d\n\u201cTanya! I\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Garrick can complete his statement, you finally enter the room causing an immediate hostile look from Garrick and a look of exasperation from Tanya.\n\n\u201cOh great\u2026\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cYOU! Get out of here, we\u2019re having a private conversation!\u201d Garrick yells.\n\u201cTanya, WE need to talk. There\u2019s something going on between us and I have to think you know what I mean. This has been a long time coming and I can\u2019t just continue to walk around here in silence any longer.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, you don\u2019t need to be walking around here anymore period. You\u2019re out of the Guild! You\u2019ve been nothing a headache since I allowed you in here! I can\u2019t believe I was so blind to think you would be an asset in the first place!\u201d\n\u201cGarrick, I\u2019m not even arguing with you and I\u2019ll be more than happy to leave this shitty Guild, but I\u2019ve got to speak to Tanya first.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead then.\u201d Tanya says a bit defeated.\n\n\n\n\u201cTanya, I\u2019ve been having dreams about you for past few months ever since everything that went down with the Neroth cultists. Now I dunno if you\u2019re doing it on purpose or what, but these dreams have been more than just dreams, it\u2019s like\u2026it\u2019s like they\u2019re real somehow. You\u2019re talking to me. WE\u2019RE talking to each other about, well everything. My past, your past, our likes, our dislikes. I swear it\u2019s like we\u2019ve been dating without actually going out.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. You don\u2019t know shit about Tanya. You\u2019ve been making shit up in your delusional mind. Wishful thinking about shit that\u2019s never going to happen! Okay asshole, if you know so much, why don\u2019t you give us a little history lesson?\u201d\n\u201cGladly.\u201d\n\nYou begin with a description of the orphanage Tanya grew up in and the apathetic lady who ran it. You mention how Tanya had to beat up two older boys when she was six because they were accusing her of stealing their food. After she broke one boy\u2019s arms and the nose of the other boy, the other children remained afraid of her.\n\nShe ran away from the orphanage altogether by the time she was nine and lived on the streets until she was around thirteen where upon Garrick caught her trying to pick his pocket. You even describe the type of day it was, mentioning that it was lightly raining. After he caught Tanya he offered her a place in the Guild.\n\nAt this point Tanya and Garrick are just silent as you relay this information. Garrick\u2019s mouth nearly hangs open as he knows you\u2019re exactly right about everything. He can\u2019t believe that you know all this. Tanya even looks a away a couple times.\n\n\u201cAnd you told me, that you\u2019ve remained loyal for the past twenty some odd years since that time at first because you originally felt obligated to Garrick for giving you a home and helping you when nobody else was, but there was a point when you started to feel less satisfied here and you considered leaving.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTanya! You never told me this! Is this true?!\u201d Garrick remarks.\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t answer, she just looks at you like you\u2019re going to tell him anyway, so why stop?\n\n\u201cShe never told anyone that. She would have left too, but then her mother showed up and after her brief meeting, she stayed with the Guild. Not because she had great attachment to it, but because she feared what she might do without it keeping her somewhat grounded. The Guild became a sort of sanctuary against her infernal nature. Sure, thievery isn\u2019t exactly the most noble of professions, but it\u2019s a far cry from what infernals like to engage in.\u201d you say.\n\nGarrick turns back to Tanya.\n\n\u201cTanya, you could have told me this! Why didn\u2019t you? I could have\u2026\u201d Garrick starts to say before he\u2019s interrupted.\n\u201cYou could have what Garrick? Tried to make everything better like you always think you can? This is what I was talking about earlier, you CAN\u2019T FUCKING HELP ME! Nobody can! I mean just look at what\u2019s occurred\u2026I\u2019m meeting this infatuated loser in his dreams and telling him my whole life story and I was only barely aware of some of it! How long before I have complete control over it? My infernal nature is coming out and it can\u2019t be stopped. Stop trying to fucking save me because I\u2019m NEVER going to love you Garrick or at least not in the way YOU want.\u201d Tanya shouts\n\nGarrick says nothing; he just staggers back a bit against a table like all the wind has been knocked out of him. Tanya now turns her attention towards you.\n\n\u201cAnd as for you, your best option would be running far away from this place and from me before it gets worse. I don\u2019t care how much you THINK you\u2019re in love with me.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cOr even how much you might be in love with me?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cNow THAT is wishful thinking and not what is happening.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe love isn\u2019t the right word, but I have a hard time believing that you didn\u2019t contact me in my dreams for shits and giggles. You\u2019re actually fun in those dreams and I know you well enough in the real world that you never do anything remotely fun. It\u2019s like you wanted me to see another side of you that nobody else does. Arguably the closest person you were close to before I showed up was Garrick, and you only see him as a father figure at best. You didn\u2019t contact him in his dreams. You didn\u2019t show up in anyone else\u2019s either. You showed up in mine because you obviously have a fondness for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSHUT UP! SHUT UP!\u201d Garrick suddenly shouts and lunges at you.\n\nHe tackles you to the floor and you roll around briefly with him, but you soon get him off of you. However, he\u2019s managed to pilfer your pistol that was tucked in your clothing.\n\n\u201cGarrick! Put that down!\u201d Tanya shouts.\n\u201cWhy?! Just so you can go off with this dickhead? No! How many people have fallen for you Tanya? How many? I\u2019ve lost count. Why does THIS one get your affection?\u201d Garrick screams and then starts laughing.\n\n\u201cI WAS the one who took you in! I WAS the one who gave you purpose and apparently I was the one who gave you salvation! Don\u2019t you see Tanya? I\u2019M the one who loves you! I always did! But if I can\u2019t have you\u2026then I suppose I\u2019ll have to accept that\u2026but what I won\u2019t accept is someone else having you instead!\u201d\n\nGarrick is pointing the pistol right at you and ready to fire. You might be quick enough to stop him, or you might not. Tanya looks like she might do something, but who knows?", "action_results": [{"action": "Grab the gun from Garrick", "result": "You take that chance that you\u2019re quick enough and Garrick is so emotional right now that he\u2019s not focused like he should.\n\nYou lunge for the pistol.\n\nA loud sound is heard followed by the sensation of a burning force hitting you hard in the lower chest. Still working on adrenaline you don\u2019t stop and continue to try to wrestle the pistol from Garrick. He fires again, but this time misses as you move his arm and then break his wrist completely causing him to drop it.\n\nTanya at this point intervenes and tackles Garrick and you all go tumbling on the floor.\n\nTanya starts screaming at Garrick and punching him in the face while he unsuccessfully tries to fend her off. You on the other hand are now coming to realize that you\u2019ve been shot pretty badly and your adrenaline has worn off.\n\nYou cough blood and wheeze as death is finally catching up to you. Tanya goes over to you and starts telling you to hold on while she frantically attempts to look for something in her room to help you, but there isn\u2019t anything and it wouldn\u2019t help anyway.\n\nYou look over to your left and see Garrick\u2019s face mashed into bloody mush. Not being able to find anything to help your wound, Tanya attempts to lift you up, but you tell her to stop.\n\n\u201cTanya, stop. You\u2019re not going to get me to an infirmary or the apothecary in time.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut\u2026it can\u2019t end like this! Not now! Not when I\u2026(sob)\u201d\n\u201cJust wasn\u2019t (cough) meant to be\u2026but it\u2019s okay. At least I know finally.\u201d\n\nAnd with those last words your eyes begin to close and you feel the taste of Tanya\u2019s lips on your own before you pass on.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Wait", "result": "You\u2019re putting a lot of trust into Tanya right now\u2026\n\nSince you aren\u2019t going for the gun, you attempt to stall for time.\n\n\u201cGarrick, look, she isn\u2019t exactly tripping over herself for me either despite me revealing all this information. If anything she probably dislikes me even more now. She\u2019s not worth dying for so you want me gone, fine, I\u2019m going. And if it will suffice, my apologies.\u201d You say and start backing away with your hands up.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that will NOT suffice!\u201d Garrick exclaims before Tanya tackles him.\n\nTanya knocks the pistol from his hand and easily subdues him while you grab your weapon off the floor. He struggles for a bit, but then eventually just stops and starts crying.\n\n\u201cTanya, move out of the way.\u201d You say fully intent on killing Garrick\n\u201cNo! I know what he did, but you\u2019re not killing him! Despite everything, the man DID help me at one time and I\u2019m not going to just forget that. Just leave us.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cWhat about\u2026you know what, forget it.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re done. You might still have strong feelings for Tanya, but obviously you\u2019re going to have to get over them and hopefully in time they will eventually dissipate by putting as much space as you can between you and her. You also hope the dreams will come to an end because if they don\u2019t that\u2019s going to make the process a lot harder, if not impossible.\n\nTroubles for another time however and you\u2019ll deal with it when you have to.\n\nYou make your way out of the Thieves\u2019 Guild as quick as you can, into the sewers and to the closest manhole cover. One thing you aren\u2019t going to miss and that\u2019s mucking around in the damn sewers.\n\nYou look around and see a few stores that have been looted, some in the process of being looted, but nothing excessive. The city isn\u2019t on fire or anything. (Just a couple of buildings)\n\nYour goal is to get the hell out and as far as possible from this damn city because there really isn\u2019t anything holding you here now.\n\nYou attempt to avoid potential trouble by taking the quieter side streets. Midway through you half wonder if you should have just used the sewers until you got closer to the front gate, but it\u2019s too late now.\n\nYou turn down an alleyway to avoid a Holgard Watch patrol rounding up dissidents, and that\u2019s when you bump right into Tanya. While you are caught off guard a bit, there\u2019s a small part of you that was sort of hoping you\u2019d see her.\n\n\u201cDo I even need to ask how you even tracked me in all this chaos?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already dreaming about me, I think you know the answer. I\u2019ve pretty much imprinted on you at this point, though I suppose not completely.\u201d Tanya replies.\n\u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d\n\u201cIt means if you wanted to, you could still get away. You would eventually in time get away from me or any feelings relating to me. Even the dreams would disappear eventually. Probably would be the best option for you because I can\u2019t imagine it getting any better for you, if you stayed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I always sort of figured those might be my options anyway, but what do YOU want? I mean I get the reasons for you pushing me away, but is that what you really want?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not really. I would like to have a close relationship with you, I probably have even before the cultist incident. I mean now especially considering I know nearly everything about your life just like you know most of mine. Like you said, we\u2019ve practically been dating, just without the hassle of going out.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re really dating types anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHah, probably not. I just don\u2019t know though. I mean how do I know if your feelings are real for me, or if it\u2019s all just infernal magic? How do I know that my feelings for you are genuine or if I\u2019m just luring you in and going to just suck out your soul eventually?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked myself the same question multiple times as I\u2019m sure you have. I mean I\u2019m sure some of it is infernal influence, since I was just about to leave and now here I am completely re-considering. However, I think this is the important difference. I NEED to know if you really feel the same way. If don\u2019t, even to the smallest degree, then I\u2019ll know that I should leave. It won\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019ll deal with it. If I was completely under your spell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even have the capacity to even think about leaving.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just it, you\u2019re not completely under my spell or influence, but I\u2019m worried that one day you might get that way! I mean I want you to be a freethinking being. There\u2019s so much shit going on and I\u2019m experiencing changes a lot faster than I ever have before. Look!\u201d\n\nAnd this point Tanya takes her hood off and you not only see her lovely face clearly, but two little horns. She must go to great lengths to arrange her hair to cover them, along with wearing the hood.\n\n\u201cUh, how long have you had those?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cA few weeks now.\u201d Tanya remarks.\n\u201cOh. Well you shouldn\u2019t cover them, I find them to be cute.\u201d You say trying to bring a little levity to the situation.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to gore you with them if you don\u2019t start taking this seriously! I mean I just killed Garrick and I don\u2019t even feel that bad about it. I mean shouldn\u2019t I feel something?\u201d\n\u201cWait. He\u2019s fucking dead? You stopped ME from killing him. What the hell happened?\u201d\n\u201cI spoke with Garrick a little in an attempt to calm him down, but the man was a complete emotional wreck. He practically begged me to kill him at that point since he claimed he couldn\u2019t go on living the way he was living. So I honored his wishes. It was the least I could do.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026it was a kindness. I mean it\u2019s a little unorthodox, and granted I\u2019m certainly not shedding any tears, but it wasn\u2019t like you killed him in cold blood.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but for better or worse, the man WAS my father in a way. I mean ignoring all the rest of his unwanted feelings, I do remember the positives. Despite all that, I haven\u2019t even cried. Shouldn\u2019t I cry?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, maybe his recent actions muted your feelings or maybe you\u2019re just dealing with them in another way\u2026um are able to cry? Serious question.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Just haven\u2019t done it since I was a child though. I guess it\u2019s not important anyway. My point is I\u2019m worried that I might become a complete monster and I don\u2019t want you to be in my path when that happens since you\u2019ll most likely be the first victim.\u201d\n\u201cWell the fact that you\u2019re so concerned about me, is a pretty good indication that you\u2019re no heartless monster and you\u2019re talking about something that MIGHT happen, not that it will. Besides, despite all of what we\u2019ve shared you still don\u2019t know everything about me either.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You a shapeshifter or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I wish it was that interesting. But what I\u2019m referring to is something a lot more mundane. Just a secret of my own I\u2019ve been harboring and if we\u2019re going to be together, I might as well come clean right now.\u201d\n\nYou explain your dealings with the Ebony Claw Syndicate, constantly pointing out that you are NOT actually a member and that you haven\u2019t even done anything that would harm the Guild, though you wonder if that even matters anymore given that Tanya just killed Garrick.\n\nTanya\u2019s reaction is one of shock. For a moment it looks like she\u2019s going to punch you, but then she just shakes her head and actually chuckles. You think it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen her remotely laugh.\n\n\u201cFuck it. I mean at one time I would have killed you as a hypocritical traitor, but what difference does it make now? I already killed the head of the Guild. I\u2019m hardly in a position to judge. If anything, I think I feel better about all this.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell here I was worrying that my infernal influence was slowly turning you into my slave or something, but obviously I don\u2019t have that much influence if you\u2019re able to keep a pretty big secret like that from me.\u201d\n\u201cUm, well I did just confess to you.\u201d\n\u201cOh right. Shit.\u201d\n\u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have pointed that out. I do want to stress though I never actually betrayed the Guild though, I always wanted to tell you because I felt it was the honest thing to do. I just never could figure out a good way to do it and then for awhile you wanted me to leave you alone and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust stop. As I said, it hardly matters now. (Sigh) The next question, is where does this all leave us? I mean seeing as you\u2019re a half spy for the Syndicate and I just murdered the leader of the Guild, it\u2019s not like either of us can go back.\u201d\n\u201cBefore you caught up to me, I was about ready to leave the city.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea, though I\u2019ve never left Holgard. There\u2019s also the fact that you have some unfinished business with the Ebony Claw Syndicate. Aren\u2019t you worried they might hunt you down?\u201d\n\u201cWell if I stay here, they\u2019re even more likely to find me. They probably aren\u2019t going to bother looking for me anyway. And wouldn\u2019t you be with me?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I would. However, I\u2019m still reluctant to leave Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s holding you here now?\u201d\n\u201cNothing I suppose, but maybe I wouldn\u2019t mind leaving Holgard if it didn\u2019t feel like running. I mean I\u2019ve spent so many years fighting the Ebony Claw, I\u2019d hate to just hand the fucking city over to them. Yeah, I know it\u2019s foolish, and maybe I\u2019m just feeling the need to at least avenge the Guild considering I practically just destroyed it myself.\u201d\n\u201cI think they were always going to win. They just have the numbers and now you\u2019re suggesting just the two of us going against them?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not and I mean we probably could do a lot more damage with just the two of us no longer being restrained by Garrick\u2019s caution. We can make a plan. The more I\u2019m thinking about it, the more I really want to do this. I feel like giving myself this purpose would be a good way of directing my energy. Granted it\u2019s not exactly the most virtuous way, but surely it\u2019s still a positive thing taking down a criminal organization that engages in various violent and illegal activity, right?\u201d\n\nSeems Tanya is trying to figure out a few things in light of trying to handle all her recent actions and physical changes. She tells you that she would like you to stay to help her, but she would completely understand if all you want to do is put as much distance as you can between yourself and this place.\n\nInfernal influence or not, you\u2019re not going to let her go into this alone. Besides you wouldn\u2019t mind taking out that one eyed asshole, or at least that fucker that keeps shoving a crossbow in your back.\n\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m in. I stayed here for you this long and I\u2019m not going to leave when you need my help the most. So, let\u2019s get to this plan of yours.\u201d\n\nTanya smiles a bit and then hugs you. A bit sudden, but certainly not unwelcome. You have to admit, you\u2019re already glad you\u2019ve made this decision even if you\u2019re dreading the danger that\u2019s to come from it.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan and what\u2019s it all going to entail exactly?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go some place else to discuss this. Probably not at the Guild headquarters or Hell\u2019s Own, though, um\u2026let\u2019s go the Lighthouse.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cThe Lighthouse?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s an inn close to the docks area and they probably aren\u2019t getting much business anymore what with less ships coming in right now. We can use that as our meeting and planning place for right now.\u201d Tanya says and puts her hood back up.\n\nThe pair of you travels there without any problems. It seems the rioting and civil unrest has died down for the rest of the night. The owner of The Lighthouse seems pretty surprised (and happy) that anyone is checking in since the place is practically empty.\n\nYou pay for your one room and the pair of you head to it.\n\nNo sooner have you entered the room and you\u2019re about to ask Tanya about what she has planned, you see her taking her clothing off.\n\n\u201cTanya, wha\u2026what\u2019re you doing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like? I\u2019m getting ready to make love to you. In fact why are you still dressed? I would have thought you\u2019d be the first one to have your pants off by now.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cI\u2026well I just didn\u2019t know we were getting into that tonight, I mean I figured you might need a little time. Plus, I figured we were going to discuss the plan to take down the Ebony Claw Syndicate which is not going to be an easy task.\n\u201cAll the more reason to do this now. One of us could die when we start seriously pursuing this path. Now I know maybe this isn\u2019t going to be a big deal to you, but I think I\u2019d like to actually experience sex in the flesh to see what all the fuss is about.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026.you\u2019ve never?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Why would I? I\u2019ve never fancied anyone before and I\u2019ve been fighting my succubus heritage remember? That means no sex of any kind. Hell, up until that incident with the cultists, I hadn\u2019t even kissed anyone before.\u201d\n\u201cI was your first kiss too?\u201d\n\u201cYep, looks like you\u2019re conquering the rest of the virgin territory tonight. Hope that\u2019s not too much pressure, but then why would it be? Not like I can compare you to anyone else right?\u201d\n\u201cUm, sure I guess so.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Anyway, take off your clothes, I really want to get to this.\u201d\n\nYou have to admit, after all the times you\u2019ve fantasized and dreamed about these encounters, none of them ever were like this.\n\nThe two of you soon get to it and it\u2019s fairly interesting. Tanya might be a virgin, but she\u2019s obviously a natural. Of course being half succubus might have something to do with that.\n\nThe session goes on for quite awhile. While you definitely don\u2019t want to disappoint, you find that you\u2019re struggling in the endurance department, though you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s because Tanya\u2019s taking out decades of pent up sexual energy on you or again, it\u2019s because she\u2019s part succubus and she\u2019s actively draining your own energy.\n\nShe can tell you\u2019re obviously feeling ill effects and finishes you off before she possibly inadvertently kills you.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?! You look really pale, I have some water in my pack.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026(wheeze) fine\u2026I\u2019ll take that water though.\u201d You struggle to say.\n\nAs you down the water, Tanya cuddles up next to you lovingly.\n\n\u201cSo was it like you imagined?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cIt was good of course, but definitely more intense. What about you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt was okay.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t mean that as an insult! You were fine and enjoyed all the closeness and it was pleasurable, but somehow I was expecting more given how much people talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell we can try again later after... shit, I\u2019m tired. I dunno if I\u2019m in any condition to process a plan right now.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You get your rest, I\u2019ll just be right here beside you.\u201d\n\nYou slowly start to drift off as you feel Tanya rubbing against your body and almost wrapping herself around you like a second skin. She then whispers \u201cI love you.\u201d in your ear and makes some odd noises which aren\u2019t exactly the most human sounding, however they do sound content, so at least there\u2019s that.\n\nWhile there wasn\u2019t a ceremony of any kind, you suddenly get the very real impression that you\u2019re married now.", "action_results": [{"action": "On to business", "result": "The next day, you surprisingly wake up in the afternoon. Tanya apparently has been awake for quite awhile though, but she\u2019s basically been watching you sleep for most of that time.\n\nWhile you\u2019d think that would probably be creepy, but considering what she is, you can\u2019t say you\u2019re all that surprised. Besides, she went to the trouble to go get you food.\n\n\u201cWell this is a nice surprise.\u201d You say taking the nearby tray.\n\u201cI just got what they sell here at the inn. I want to make sure you\u2019ve got your strength up for tonight\u2019s assault on the Guild. I know I drained you during our\u2026closeness last night. I really didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have concerns about our future intimacy, if I\u2019m going to nearly be killing you every time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are potions to help. Quick trip to the apothecary and all that.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d\n\nWhile Tanya has her worries about your sex life together, you\u2019re actually feeling a bit more positive about all this. Tanya\u2019s concern for your well-being at least shows she\u2019s not going to eat your soul anytime soon.\n\nYou and Tanya spend the rest of your time talking about her plan. It\u2019s actually fairly simple. She tells you to go back to Rook and report everything you know about the Guild. Location and everything. She says when your information pans out to be true, and what remains of the Guild is destroyed then you\u2019ll be in the Ebony Claw with no problems and from that point onward, you can tell relay vital information which she can use.\n\n\u201cWait a moment, what about all the thieves in the Guild headquarters when the Claw comes to take it down?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I thought about that and\u2026well they\u2019re just going to have to be losses for the greater goal. I mean I could warn everyone, but if it\u2019s empty then that\u2019s going to look might suspicious for you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure the place is going to be packed anyway? I mean you did just kill Garrick, surely someone has found his body by now. People might be a bit suspicious and not wish to hang around.\u201d\n\u201cUm. No, they probably didn\u2019t. First off, nobody but Garrick would dare enter my quarters in the first place. Second, I made sure to hide it from immediate sight after the deed was done.\u201d\n\u201cYou hid his\u2026nevermind. Probably good thinking on your part given what we\u2019re planning.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a problem with this plan?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Well other than the danger of becoming a mole in the EC, I suppose not, though you do realize how ruthless this plan is if you\u2019re willingly sacrificing those you once called comrades for years right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I already came to the conclusion that I never was really close to most of them anyway. True, maybe I saw the Guild as my family in some way, but ultimately I was pretty much always alone. I never bothered to interact with any of them except on a job and still always kept to myself. I\u2019m sure you saw that as well.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. Still though. Not even Sneaks?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I think you were closer to Sneaks than I ever was. That going to be a problem?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly going to be taking any pleasure in it, but I\u2019m with you all the way on this, so it\u2019s gotta be done.\u201d\n\nTanya nods at your pragmatism on the situation and tells you that you should go report to Rook and get the ball rolling on the first phase of this plan.\n\nYou leave the Lighthouse and head to the Poisoned Blade Inn which is the well known Ebony Claw hang out in the city. Granted you don\u2019t know if Rook is actually going to be there, but given that\u2019s the only way you can think of to get into contact with him, that\u2019s where you go.\n\nUnsurprisingly before you even get in the place, you\u2019re getting a lot of dirty looks from obvious Ebony Claw members on the streets. Your reception is no warmer when you get inside and you get stopped instantly by a group of EC members.\n\n\u201cYou better have a REAL good reason for coming in here.\u201d One of them says shoving your shoulder a bit.\n\u201cI do actually. I\u2019m looking for Rook, I got important business with the man and I don\u2019t exactly know how to contact him so I came here.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? Well if you don\u2019t know how to properly contact him, maybe YOU shouldn\u2019t be looking for him, let alone coming in here uninvited.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re shoved again, this time hard enough to move you back a bit.\n\n\u201cAlright fine, I\u2019ll go and one of you can relay the message that I need to see him.\u201d\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t your fucking messengers!\u201d the man says and before he can lay another hand on you, you pull your pistol.\n\n\u201cI got six shots here, maybe I\u2019m not making it out of here alive, but six of you are going down with me, and YOU are definitely first.\u201d You say and then you feel a familiar object shoved in your back. The rest of the EC members back away from you at this point.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, I wonder how effective of a killer you would be without that fancy pistol of yours.\u201d A voice whispers.\n\u201cOne might ask the same of someone who does nothing but remain invisible and bushwacks people from behind with a crossbow.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat do you want to see Rook for?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the Thieves Guild.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take you to him then.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly feel a blow to the back of your head and you go unconscious.\n\nWhen you wake up, you\u2019re in a chair at a table with Rook sitting across from you.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026was that really necessary?\u201d you ask rubbing the back of your head.\n\u201cMy right hand isn\u2019t entirely convinced of your potential and so wanted to keep directions to our current location secret. He\u2019s a bit of a hard sell, however let\u2019s get on with it. You said you had important information about the Guild yes?\u201d Rook asks.\n\nYou begin to go into detail about the Thieves Guild and it\u2019s location. You also mention you already killed Garrick and Tanya which is why you left. Rook\u2019s eyebrow rises at this revelation.\n\n\u201cTruly? And how did this come about?\u201d Rook asks.\n\u201cIn my attempt to convince Tanya, things unfortunately turned\u2026violent. I was lucky to get off a headshot before she landed a hit on me. Don\u2019t worry, nobody else knows about me and I got rid of the bodies.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, Just as well as you killed that demonkin I suppose. She might have been a bit of a wildcard. In any case you can finish off the rest when you lead the attack tomorrow.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re sending me along to finish the job huh?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDid you really expect any less? I mean shouldn\u2019t be too hard considering you already killed your girlfriend. Besides, you\u2019re still the best one who knows about the place, so it would still be helpful if you were there in person.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you going to be doing?\u201d\n\u201cA lot more important things than rolling around in the sewers with some thieves that\u2019s for sure. Don\u2019t worry; there will be someone to supervise this mission. You won\u2019t see them, but you can be sure they\u2019ll be there handy with a crossbow when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about who I think you are, they better not be jamming it into my back considering we\u2019re supposed to be on the same side now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell do a good job, and you won\u2019t ever have to worry about Bolt ever again. Now go prepare yourselves, or whatever you have to do and meet the crew in the sewers tomorrow morning at this location.\u201d Rook says pointing at the map.\n\u201cOkay, sounds like a plan.\u201d\n\u201cOh one more thing, I want that asshole Sneaks alive. I got unfinished business with him.\u201d Rook says tapping his eyepatch.\n\nNever occurred to you that Rook was the one Sneaks was talking about when he said he stabbed an EC lieutenant in the eye once.\n\nAfter a few more words, Rook escorts you out of the room and you soon learn you\u2019re at a bigger Ebony Claw headquarters that leads up into a warehouse and then eventually between the poor area of Holgard and the merchant district.\n\nFrom there you return to The Lighthouse where you get some rest for tomorrow. Tanya isn\u2019t around though, but maybe she really wants to keep a low profile now.\n\nThe next morning you arrive at the appointed location where other Ebony Claw members are waiting for you.\n\n\u201cTook you long enough. Other members are in various places in the sewers ready to ambush any escaping Guild members.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this then.\u201d You say.\n\nYou lead the way, completely surprising several thieves when you arrive.\n\nThe battle, if you can still call it that isn\u2019t much of one. What made you such a vicious killer of Ebony Claw members, has also made you an equally vicious killer Guild members. Combined with the Ebony Claw backup, it\u2019s no contest.\n\nWithout Garrick around there\u2019s no organization whatsoever and most of them attempt to flee rather than fight. Garrick himself is still hidden in Tanya\u2019s room, you drag out his body and shoot it a couple times as \u201cproof\u201d you killed him earlier. You look all over the place for Sneaks, but you don\u2019t find him at all. In fact, when you go to his room, some of his stuff is even gone. You wonder if he sensed something amiss and just quietly left on his own.\n\nAs you\u2019re exiting Sneaks room, a grubby dwarf walks up to you.\n\n\u201cHey, you. You see any more Guild members run this way?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNo, I think we got all of them that were here. I can\u2019t find Sneaks though. He\u2019s nowhere to be found.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm. Rook\u2019s not going to be happy about that. Oh well, maybe he\u2019ll pop up somewhere. Roaches always do. Guess all that\u2019s left is the looting which I think the boys are doing a good job of right now. The Syndicate has been thinking of expanding into slave trade here and this place will probably make a good location with some additions. Anyway, we should get back to Rook.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t recognize it immediately, but this man\u2019s voice is familiar, You then also notice the crossbow he\u2019s holding.\n\n\u201cYou Bolt?\u201d you ask which causes a smirk across his face.\n\u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d recognize me.\u201d\n\nYou return to Rook who is full of praise and goes on about how you\u2019re going to go far in this organization. He tells you he\u2019ll be in contact with you again soon for a more permanent future assignment and even hands you a pouch full of gold.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, take some of that and celebrate with Naji or something. My cousin\u2019s actually been missing you at the brothel. I dare say I think the girl had a genuine crush on you. Maybe you can get a new girlfriend to replace your demonkin one, but you know what they say, you can\u2019t turn a whore into a housewife. Hah!\u201d He says before dismissing you.\n\nYou head back to the Lighthouse where you once again don\u2019t find Tanya. When you bed down for the night however, she finds you in your dreams which now are a lot more vivid of her.\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a safe place, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll meet with you person when there is need to do so. In the meantime, I think this is one of the best ways for us to communicate don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose nobody will suddenly catch me talking to you, that\u2019s for sure. Anyway, it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cI know. We can talk about the next phase of the plan later, right now let us just spend relaxing time together. I know, tell me more about the little village you came from.\u201d\n\u201cReally? That place is so fucking boring.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine it probably was, but from some reason, I find tales of your youthful antics amusing.\u201d\n\u201cHm, glad someone does, because nobody in Teckleville certainly did at the time, except for maybe for me and my sister. Okay, I guess there\u2019s more than a few stories I haven\u2019t told yet\u2026\u201d\n\nAs you and Tanya spend time together in your dream, somewhere else in your mind is concerned with just how much danger you\u2019ve put yourself in being a mole in the Ebony Claw Syndicate. Never mind the fact that you\u2019ve got an increasingly more powerful half succubus that can access you in your dreams now.\n\nYou just hope you never get on her bad side.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes\u2026", "result": "Year 21\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what changes can happen in just a year and that\u2019s not even counting the fact that Holgard is in complete anarchy right now, though it probably helps quite a bit.\n\nWith your ongoing information, Tanya has carried out one woman attacks on various ECS locations and been more or less successful in the endeavor. Though perhaps not entirely \u201cone woman\u201d she\u2019s been using the chaos and the various factions of the city to her advantage, mostly the remaining disorganized followers of Neroth that have still been skulking around, though she\u2019s been luring even the Holgard Watch to do her bidding sometimes.\n\nWhile you haven\u2019t brought it up to her, you think Tanya\u2019s lost sight of her \u201coriginal goal\u201d of simply taking down the Ebony Claw Syndicate. She may have even believed that\u2019s what she was doing at first, but now? She\u2019s just been enjoying the chaos. She\u2019s enjoying making people kill and fight. Granted they probably were going to do that anyway, but she\u2019s not exactly curtailing what\u2019s currently going on right now.\n\nStill, she always returns to you excitedly going on about what she\u2019s done and what she\u2019s planning and everything else. When you meet in person, it\u2019s always a special event (If literally draining).\n\nYou remember how hostile she was towards you for years, but now she only ever looks at you with affection. You must have told your mundane stories about your life in Teckleville more than a few times to her, but for whatever reason she seems to enjoy them. Maybe it\u2019s due to her own childhood being less fun since despite everything you didn\u2019t really have it all that bad. In fact if you\u2019d just obeyed the rules, you would have had a pretty easy life. (You certainly wouldn\u2019t be in this situation)\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure how succubi are supposed to act and granted she\u2019s not a full blood one, but it\u2019s very strange that despite her obvious descent into morally questionable actions, she\u2019s still very attached to you. (Or maybe you\u2019re just not used to a very loving girlfriend, your only one before Tanya was Annah) She\u2019s also starting to change physically. Her horns for one are a little bigger and her eyes now have a permanent other worldly look.\n\nMost obvious though is her wings. They started off as two little lumps on her back that you noticed during one of your intimacy sessions. The next time you saw her, she had two small wings and are probably going to get even larger.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019ve basically been just trying to keep a low profile as you go about your ECS duties, which are currently as an enforcer at a profitable Blue Dream house in the poor district. It\u2019s a rather lowly position for someone of your talents, but on the plus side, it\u2019s so unimportant that Rook doesn\u2019t even suspect you of any wrong doing and it helps that at least a few of the top Blue Dream distributors at the place have diarrhea of the mouth due to ongoing sampling of some of the drug and never shut the fuck up about sensitive ECS information.\n\nRook has been trying to keep things together, but he\u2019s been obviously losing control. The ECS leadership in the Delantium Kingdom has refused to help with reinforcements any more. They\u2019ve told him that he needs to work with what he has and if he fails, it\u2019s not going to be good for him.\n\nYou know he\u2019s been trying to gain more help from the Temple of Fel, but that\u2019s been having mixed results mainly due to the fact that while they may all worship the same God of Shadows, the pure dedicated followers don\u2019t necessarily share the same goals as the Ebony Claw.\n\nStill, they\u2019ve been contributing enough help to \u201clend\u201d Shadow Blades to act as extra protection. Them, along with Bolt and Rook\u2019s own shadow magic abilities are going to make him quite formidable.\n\nWhich is sort of a problem now that Tanya has decided that it\u2019s time to actually take out the Ebony Claw leadership for good. Arguably, she probably could have wiped out the Ebony Claw Syndicate with your help (Or at least this increasingly smaller chapter of it) months ago. But she got so distracted with enjoying the bedlam, that it allowed Rook to fortify like he has.\n\nOf course Tanya\u2019s not at all worried about any of this, but that\u2019s easy for her to say when she\u2019s got all her new infernal powers now. Even with her help, it isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve got much defense against a bunch of highly trained shadow magic using killers.\n\nTo her credit, she\u2019s told you to stay behind on this one, claiming that she can take care of it herself. You have your doubts though. It would be a tough fight even for her. You\u2019d hate to just stand by while she got herself killed, not to mention if she failed, it would be really obvious that you were involved considering you told Rook you killed her. So you\u2019d have to help anyway, and you still don\u2019t fancy your chances.\n\nYou do have one idea, but it\u2019s a long shot and possibly one that could get you killed immediately. You could go try to talk to the head of the Temple of Fel. You don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019d say, but your hope would be to try to convince him that supporting the Ebony Claw, isn\u2019t in the best interest of the temple.\n\n\u201cWhat?! No! That\u2019s a stupid idea! I told you, I\u2019ll take care of it by myself, I don\u2019t need your help, let alone the help of my enemies.\u201d Tanya shouts.\n\u201cTanya, I\u2019m serious. This is a really BAD idea, assaulting Rook\u2019s home by yourself. I mean don\u2019t you even at least have those cultists you can send, or maybe someone else?\u201d\n\u201cThe last of the Neroth cultists died weeks ago and are probably enduring unimaginable torture right now as their reward and as for sending anyone else, I\u2019m a little tired of acting from behind the scenes, I want to enjoy a bit of hands on mayhem for a change.\u201d\n\u201cTanya, are you listening to yourself? You\u2019re starting to lose control and getting drunk on the chaos. Maybe I should have said something earlier, but you\u2019ve been this way for quite sometime now. I love you and all, but you REALLY need to get a grip. You\u2019re not even thinking strategically anymore.\u201d\n\nYour defiant words aren\u2019t something she hears very often, at first she looks surprised, even slightly hurt, but then that turns to anger very quickly.\n\nShe grabs you and throws you against the wall very hard.\n\n\u201c\u2026shit\u2026\u201d is all you can utter as you hit the stone and slump to the floor.\n\u201cHOW FUCKING DARE YOU QUESTION MY IDEAS! I\u2019m the one in control here! YOU follow MY lead! YOU are only allowed the magnificence of my presence because I allow it and you should be grateful!\u201d Tanya bellows and her voice seems to invade your very mind a bit.\n\nYou look up from your position and focus on Tanya. She\u2019s changed physically again. Her wings are bigger for one thing (you called that one) and now her skin has a reddish hue. If you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d think her eyes were going to burn a hole in you with how she\u2019s staring at you. Reminds of the old days when she used to get pissed at you, though she never slammed you this hard into a wall before.\n\nThe dominating voice you just heard is also a bit new. As a half succubus she always had a bit of a seductive tone, but this is different. Her voice just now sent a chill of fear within you. Maybe she\u2019s not completely embracing her \u201csuccubus side\u201d but she\u2019s certainly embracing the demonic heritage.\n\nStill, this is the girl you chose, so if this is how you\u2019re going out then so be it.\n\nYou struggle to get back up and lean against the wall as you address her.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe you can take them alone. You\u2019re obviously in full control of yourself, what with putting a mere mortal like me in my place and all. No need for my help anymore. I see that now.\u201d\n\nTanya\u2019s stance towards you softens a bit, but not by much. She doesn\u2019t even apologize; she just leaves the ruined house you were meeting her in and takes to the air. She apparently has decided to give absolutely zero fucks about being seen anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time you have or even if it\u2019s going to matter, but you still feel compelled to help in some way. Maybe she isn\u2019t the Tanya that you fell in love with anymore, but for better or worse, you\u2019re going to help her whether that means directly or indirectly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help directly", "result": "For all her change, you know that Tanya\u2019s probably still considering your last statement to her. Which means she probably isn\u2019t going to attack Rook immediately giving you a bit of time to form a plan.\n\nTwo things you think about first is that she may be right in that going to the Fel Temple is a bad idea. If they were willing to help Rook (no matter how reluctantly) they probably aren\u2019t going to listen to someone who isn\u2019t actually a follower.\n\nThe other thing is, Tanya has changed so much now that she probably isn\u2019t recognizable anymore, not that she really made her face visible in the first place, but she looks more like a traditional demon now rather than the half breed she actually is. You think you can spin a lie\u2026\n\nYou go to your \u201cplace of work\u201d where the usual group of lowly Ebony Claw thugs stand around keeping the Blue Dream addicts in line. Meanwhile you head to the two assholes who run the place. Dreamweaver and Mr. Dream. The unimaginative idiots must have thought they were being real clever with those names.\n\nOne of them looks up as he\u2019s counting coins while the other is sorting out blue dream vials. Neither one of them particularly likes you, so this will be all the more simple.\n\n\u201cThe fuck do you want fancy boy? Don\u2019t you have addicts to keep in line out front or managing the rest of those other losers?\u201d Mr. Dream asks.\n\u201cNot today.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThe fuck you mean by that? I\u2019m in no mood for your attitude today. I don\u2019t even know why the hell you were even allowed in our organization after what you\u2019ve done. You put several of my friends in the ground you fucker!\u201d\n\u201cGood news then. Today, you get to join them.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nMr. Dream is too late to draw his own flintlock as you plant a bullet in his head and Dreamweaver fairs no better. You\u2019ve killed the pair of them and predictably the shots draw the attention of some of the others.\n\nUsing your former bosses\u2019 firearms, you take out two EC thugs and then use the remainder of your own bullets to take out three more. A couple of the thugs probably just flat out ran off, so you don\u2019t waste much time and cut off the heads of the two Dreams and shoving them in nearby sack holding a bunch of Blue Dream which you dump out first.\n\nAfter helping yourself to some of the gold, you walk out of the office and through the rest of building until you get to the courtyard where several of junkies are still lingering about despite all the gunshots.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026can I go in to get my fix yet? I\u2019ve been waiting out here for hours!\u201d one remarks.\n\n\u201cActually all of you can go in and help yourself to all the Blue Dream you want, but one of you has to come with me and for that to happen, I need the worst of you lot to do something for a lot of coin, so who\u2019s done the most awful thing here?\u201d You ask.\nThe various addicts excited by the prospect of getting free drugs immediately start telling on each other. A couple of them confess what they've done since they apparently are thinking long term and want the coin rather than just the drugs.\nA lot of them haven\u2019t done much except steal or perform sexual favors. A couple of them have killed, but none catch your attention until one of them starts accusing another one of having sex with children.\nHe denies it and so it goes back and forth though a couple of the others back up the accuser.\n\u201cEnough! Is this even remotely true? I got shit to do and I need to know now. So if everyone here wants to get their free drugs, you need to fucking confess or step aside and let someone else earn this coin. I'm not going to judge you anyway.\u201d\nThe one who was accused slowly steps forward.\n\u201cWell, it was just one time. She was ten and she wanted to know about sex and I figured it was my duty as a parent to\u2026\u201d\nYou don\u2019t even wait, you just shoot him. This causes the rest to run a bit or take cover, but they don\u2019t go far. You quickly go to the sick fuck\u2019s body and cut off his head with your short sword and shove it in your bag of heads.\n\nThe addict stand around gawking for a moment, but then quickly realize they should go get their free drugs and run inside the house, leaving you to head over to Rook\u2019s place.\n\nWhile normally walking about in the open during the day with a bag of heads where the blood is leaking through might cause some issues, but given the state of the city, it just serves as a warning for people not to mess with you.\n\nRook, nowadays rarely leaves his mansion. You aren\u2019t sure who had it before he did, but you do know he just took it over soon after the Guild was wiped out. You\u2019re stopped at the front gate by one of the Ebony Claw members.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want and what the hell is in the bag?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cSevered heads of fucking loudmouths and spies. Look, I got important shit to talk to Rook about and I just dragged my ass through riots to get here, so let me the fuck in.\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t give the damn orders here! Nobody gets in to see Rook without his say so! So you\u2019re just going to have wait until one of us goes to see if it\u2019s okay first and I don\u2019t particularly feel motivated to do so and neither does anyone else, let alone for the likes of you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. Bitch, you will LET me in there because if you don\u2019t I\u2019m going to do to YOU and the rest of these assholes what I did to these fuckers.\u201d\n\nAt this point you dump out the contents of the bag and bloody heads drop out.\n\n\u201cSHIT! That\u2019s Mr. Dream!\u201d one of them exclaims.\n\u201cAnd that one\u2019s Dreamweaver! He fucking killed them!\u201d another exclaims.\n\nThe female Claw member who was talking to you before now looks a little more concerned by your presence and starts going for her weapon.\n\n\u201cDo not even fucking think about it sweetheart. I will fucking shoot you in both tits and then after I\u2019m done killing the rest of these sorry excuses for Syndicate members, I will violate your dying body and the last thing you\u2019re going to feel before you leave this shitty earth is me coming inside your ass and laughing while doing it.\u201d You threaten.\n\u201cShit\u2026fuck man. There\u2019s no need for damn rape threats. Fine, you wanna go see Rook you crazy fucker, be my fucking guest. You\u2019re still not getting past those Shadow Blade guys though and if you do, Rook\u2019s going to be pissed at you for killing some of his top Blue Dream dealers anyway. I hope he fucking cuts your dick and balls off and shoves them down your throat!\u201d The female Claw member says and starts motioning for the others to open the gates while you collect the bloody heads and shove them back the bag.\n\nAs you walk through the gates and towards the mansion, you shake your head.\n\n\u201cShit, that was a bit dark for me, but hell, no wonder the Syndicate is going to shit, if they\u2019re backing down from a threat like that.\u201d You say.\n\nYou get to the front door and you are immediately stopped by some cloaked individuals who just suddenly appear around you.\n\nYou fight the instinct to immediately go for your weapon, not that you\u2019d be fast enough anyway since two of them have already grabbed your arms, while another takes your bag and all your weapons.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s you business here?\u201d one of them asks.\n\nTaking a politer approach you explain everything or rather you spin your lie which isn\u2019t completely a lie since the two Dreams were pair of loudmouth assholes that blabbed shit so freely that\u2019s what allowed you to relay most inside information to Tanya in the first place.\n\nYou add the extra bit that the head of the Blue Dream addict was a Neroth cultist spy and explain that\u2019s how come groups of Neroth cultists have been fucking up Ebony Claw interests as of late.\n\nThe head Shadow Blade whispers to one of his comrades who enters the mansion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a moment, then we\u2019ll proceed from there.\u201d He says and then motions for the ones holding your arms to let you go. They don\u2019t give you back your weapons (or the bag) though.\n\nYou wait in silence for a bit, and then eventually the other one comes out and nods.\n\n\u201cOkay, looks like you\u2019re in the clear for now. Follow him inside and if you survive your meeting with Rook and he okays it, then you\u2019ll get your weapons back.\u201d The lead Shadow Blade says.\n\nAs you start to head in, the lead Shadow Blade grabs your shoulder and whispers to you.\n\n\u201cAll secrets are eventually uncovered by Fel.\u201d He says and then lets go of your shoulder.\n\nThe pair of you look at each other briefly, and its almost like the Shadow Blade is telling you already that he thinks you\u2019re lying. It\u2019s enough to put some fear into you though you hold it together and go inside the mansion.\n\nAfter following the Shadow Blade through a series of halls and eventually to Rook\u2019s office. He sits behind a desk with Bolt on his right side and slightly behind his chair. Rook is talking with another skinny man off to the side that you\u2019ve never seen before, but judging by all the books on the desk, you guess that he might be some beancounter that tracks the accounts and such.\n\n\u201cRook, we are hemorrhaging coin. We are not going to have enough to kick up to the Syndicate Directors this month. This state of anarchy is really bad for business and the deal you made with the Temple of Fel REALLY took a large chunk out of our treasury.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what the fuck was I supposed to do Lloyd? We had a manpower shortage, and I was getting no fucking help from the directors! Those fuckers have been sitting on their fat asses in the Delantium Kingdom for so fucking long they don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s really like to struggle any fucking more. The Temple of Fel is an ally to the Syndicate and apparently the only reliable one I have right now besides Bolt here. And THIS asshole, who I may have put too much trust in, apparently just took it upon himself to waste two of my best distributors!\u201d Rook says turning his attention to you.\n\nRook at this point stands up.\n\n\u201cNow I was already told the little story that you told everyone outside in order to get in here, but why don\u2019t you go over it again with me directly so I can try to grasp it myself and attempt to understand your logic.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re on the spot and now you suddenly don\u2019t feel very sure about this plan, but you\u2019re here now so you better be convincing.", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell the story again with complete confidence", "result": "Adding more lies is only going to trip you up on details if further questioned. Better to stick with the same story.\n\nYou tell Rook the same story you told the Shadow Blade outside and try to remain as calm as possible the whole time. You manage, but it\u2019s stressful as hell as Rook is studying you the entire time along with Bolt staring at you with that typical grim dwarven expression and even this Lloyd person who occasionally makes a brief frown.\n\nEventually you finish which is followed by some uncomfortable silence. Rook looks over at Bolt who shrugs, then over to Lloyd who is quite vocal.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s talking bullshit. I dunno what his game is, but I don\u2019t like his story and I think you should kill him.\u201d Lloyd says.\n\u201cWho the fuck are you to call me a liar!? You weren\u2019t there, that\u2019s what happened!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cDoubt it. I\u2019ve seen the best liars in action and you aren\u2019t one of them. Your whole story sounds suspicious and given what I already have heard about you, I\u2019m not sure why Rook ever trusted you.\u201d\n\nThis little smug asshole\u2019s tone is enough to cause you to nearly go at him, but Rook and Bolt both react in a manner that suggest that you shouldn\u2019t even attempt it.\n\n\u201cRook, I\u2019m telling you the damn truth.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m quite convinced. I mean there are some things about your story that feel a little weak and I don\u2019t have the luxury of interrogating Mr. Dream or Weaver, because you killed them both. All I got is your word and right now, that\u2019s not much.\u201d\n\u201cWell what do you want me to do? Swear to the gods? I mean I\u2019ll swear to Fel if that will\u2026\u201d\n\nThis remark causes Rook to give you a stare that could burn a hole through you.\n\n\u201cThe fuck did you say?\u201d he asks.\n\nBefore you can even answer, Rook smashes his fist into your face and begins kicking you on the floor. He also starts ranting at you about disrespecting the name of Fel. Saying that an unbeliever such as yourself attempting to invoke the name in order to gain some sort of leverage because of his own faith is offensive to him.\n\nRook now really doesn\u2019t believe anything you have to say, so the only chance you hope to have is to hold out until Tanya gets here. Unfortunately Rook is so mad, that he\u2019s intent on killing you now.\n\nBefore you can beg, fight back or attempt to talk your way out of this, Rook removes his eyepatch revealing a black gem in his eye socket. A solid black beam of dark energy emits from it and hits you in your head.\n\nThe dark energy liquefies your brain while having the added bonus of creating horrifying visions as you die. You scream and writhe in physical and mental agony for a few minutes before your body gives out completely.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Take a risk with even more lies", "result": "Fel might be uncover all secrets, but he can\u2019t find you if you keep one step ahead by piling on more bullshit to hide under.\n\n\u201cThis is Lloyd?\u201d you ask.\n\nYour question catches Rook and Lloyd off guard. Bolt just remains stoic.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s fucking Lloyd, but how is that fucking relevant t to your situation?\u201d Rook exclaims.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very relevant, because apparently this asshole has been skimming money for himself for years.\u201d You say.\n\nNow Rook and Bolt both look over at hapless Lloyd who is now on the verge of shitting his pants and you haven\u2019t even gotten started.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what?! That\u2019s absurd!\u201d Lloyd says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what Mr. Dream said. He said you\u2019ve been ripping off the Syndicate for years and just shuffling the book around or whatever it is you do. I don\u2019t quite understand all that mathy stuff myself, but I guess you\u2019re good at it, if you got away with it for so long\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cThis asshole is lying Rook!\u201d\n\u201cIn fact Mr. Dream said he wouldn\u2019t have known if you hadn\u2019t caved in to take a hit of Blue Dream on a dare two years ago when you were getting the take and they dared you to try a hit of Blue Dream. You ended up caving in and got so high you started bragging to him and Dreamweaver about your genius system. Where upon they blackmailed you into giving them a cut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cROOK! You\u2019re not seriously listening to this?! This man has told a story about Mr. Dream and Dreamweaver being snitches! Now he\u2019s claiming we were all ripping you off!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I never said the Dreams were snitches, I said they were loudmouth assholes that blabbed so much they let a Neroth spy catch wind of all our operations so they could fuck them up. And as for you lot ripping off the Syndicate, well why the hell else would this chapter be hemorrhaging coin as you put it? I work at that Blue Dream House and I know damn well we make more than THIS.\u201d\n\nAt this point you empty your pockets and coin pouch of some of the gold you took from the Blue Dream House and dump in all on the floor.\n\n\u201cThat is all I found in the safe after I killed those two idiots. I looked all over for a hiding place, thinking they might have it elsewhere, but I guess they weren\u2019t dumb enough to hide it on the premises. In any case it\u2019s pretty obvious Rook should be getting way more coin than he\u2019s been getting and you\u2019re obviously trying to get him killed by the directors\u2026\u201d\n\u201cROOK! I swear to Fel I am NOT doing that! This\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLloyd. Calm yourself and sit the fuck down before you have a heart attack. Have drink or something while you\u2019re at it.\u201d Rook says.\n\nWhile Lloyd pours himself a glass of some sort of liquor and sits down, Rook steps out from behind his desk and approaches you.\n\n\u201cOkay, this is a very elaborate story you\u2019re telling. My question is this though. How do you know all this shit in the first place? I mean I only have your word on this. I can\u2019t obviously interrogate Mr. Dream or Weaver about this, because you fucking killed them. Lloyd here is obviously hysterical and going to plead his innocence. I\u2019m NOT even saying what you\u2019re saying is a lie because we ARE all a bunch of fucking criminals when it comes down to it, but I\u2019m gonna need a little more convincing.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure what else I can do.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a great start, however let me help you. For instance, if Mr. Dream and Weaver were these loudmouths that you claim they were, why the hell didn\u2019t you report any of this sooner?\u201d\n\u201cWell for one thing, I was always kept in the fucking courtyard for the most part. I didn\u2019t really catch wind of a lot of this until recently and I still didn\u2019t know what was bullshit and what wasn\u2019t. Mr. Dream once bragged that he shut down a brothel once because he wore out all the women that night, and I know damn well that didn\u2019t happen because he barely could last five minutes with the Blue Dream whores if the jokes were any indication. I wanted to collect more information first before moving forward on it.\u201d\n\u201cThey were potentially fucking stealing money and talking about sensitive information, what the fuck else were you waiting for?!\u201d\n\u201cOkay fine. I fucked up. Maybe I should have moved sooner. That\u2019s on me and I\u2019ll take whatever punishment you decide. However as soon as I found out about the Neroth spy skulking about, I acted. I mean maybe I should have come to you first, but I was so pissed after I interrogated that dickhead that I just lost it. I cut off that fuckers feet and hands and he was still laughing about how stupid we were for letting our secrets slip so easily.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but that\u2019s the other part of your story I don\u2019t entirely understand. Why the hell are the Neroth cultists have such a damn hard on for us anyway? I mean granted we aren\u2019t buddies, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve gone out of our way to fuck with them.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell they see us as the biggest threat to control over the city. The spy admitted it and I mean their previous actions over the past few months have proven that due to all their attacks. Not to mention the Syndicate is allied with the Temple of Fel which is a rival god, so it makes perfect sense to take out two enemies so closely linked. And I suppose perhaps maybe I am to blame as well. The cult of Neroth and I have sort of a history and it probably doesn\u2019t help the Syndicate that they have a personal vendetta against me. I still get the odd cultist trying to assassinate me every now and then.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I suppose that makes sense. Didn\u2019t realize there were that many left though. Figured we killed them all by now.\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah that\u2019s the other bit and the main reason why I came to warn you directly. There aren\u2019t many of them left and so they\u2019re desperate. One of the things the cultist laughed about before he died was the fact that all this chaos has allowed them to summon a greater infernal or something. He didn\u2019t say what it was exactly, just that it was coming to wreak havoc on the Syndicate. And I hate to step out of line here, because I know I\u2019ve already probably pissed you off, but the more time we waste with trying to determine if I\u2019m a liar or not, is less time we have preparing for this attack.\u201d\n\nRook looks at you for a while. You know that he\u2019s trying to see if you\u2019re lying about all this. You maintain your composure. He looks over at Bolt who seems to shrug, then he looks over at Lloyd who continues to nervously drink.\n\nRook finally turns his attention back to you.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll have more of the members brought here to protect the place.\u201d Rook remarks.\n\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what you should do!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhy the fuck not? You just said there\u2019s a fucking demon coming to attack us.\u201d\n\u201cThere is, but think about it. I mean this is your home, there\u2019s no business conducted here or at least not in the direct sense. That demon is probably going to hit our Blue Dream Houses, our brothels, whatever businesses we\u2019re collecting protection on and what about that brand new slave market that opened up in the old Thieves Guild?\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we need more protection on all of our interests. Well that\u2019s great and all, but we don\u2019t exactly have that many more people. Any extra we do have are protecting this place.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait, are you seriously telling me I should lower my own fucking security? What the hell happens if the demon does strike here?!\u201d\n\u201cWell I mean you\u2019re skilled at fighting, you can do all that shadow magic stuff. Bolt here obviously has his talents as a marksman. I mean I\u2019ll help too, granted I\u2019m not as good as you two, but I HAVE had experience in fighting a demon before\u2026okay she was a half demon and I got lucky, but who knows I might lucky again. I\u2019m just saying that the three of us are better equipped to fight a demon than the regular Syndicate members at other locations. I think they could benefit with at least some help from a Shadow Blade assigned to them.\u201d\n\nRook is rubbing his face at all the information you\u2019ve been dropping on him. On top of all his other concerns, this is all a bit overwhelming. Meanwhile Lloyd has managed to calm himself down long enough for him to start talking again.\n\n\u201cRook, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re listening to this man. He was KILLING us for years before he joined and he hasn\u2019t stopped! He just walked in here with the heads of two of our best people and is accusing me of ripping off the Syndicate! I\u2019ve dedicated my LIFE to this organization and you should know that because you\u2019ve known me for a lot longer than you\u2019ve known this fucking liar!\u201d Lloyd says.\n\u201cLloyd, I\u2019ve honestly only known you only a little longer than I\u2019ve known this guy. YOU were sent here from the Delantium Kingdom as so called help with the money matters and all that other shit. For all I know you\u2019ve been sent here to spy on me and setting me up to fail.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me! I get absolutely no fucking support from the directors when I need it the most. You claim we don\u2019t have enough money to send back when we should damn well have a surplus! At this point I\u2019m less inclined to trust YOU than I am him.\u201d\n\u201cRook! I know you\u2019re under a lot of stress right now, but listen to reason! I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBolt.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Bolt shoots Lloyd in the throat, who clutches his neck and gurgles a bit before he slumps down dead.\n\n\u201cBolt, tell our Shadow Blade friends outside that each one of them needs to go to our most profitable locations. Probably not enough of them to cover them all, but we got what we got.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cWhat about the members at the gate?\u201d Bolt asks.\n\u201cOh, they can stay. If the demon does show up here, maybe they can hurt it a bit before it kills them.\u201d\n\u201cOkay Rook.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get this man\u2019s weapons back while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\nBolt walks out the door and now it\u2019s just you and Rook.\n\n\u201cAs for you, make yourself useful and dispose of Lloyd\u2019s body, I don\u2019t care what you do with it, just get it out of my office.\u201d Rook orders.\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d You say.\n\nAs you\u2019re dragging Lloyd\u2019s carcass away all you can do is thank Yag that Rook\u2019s paranoia was placed in a direction other than yourself.\n\nEventually you dump Lloyd\u2019s body somewhere in the backyard and turn around to return to the mansion only to find the Shadow Blade leader standing before you.\n\nYou try to be taken too much by surprised, but you can\u2019t help be a little startled.\n\n\u201cHere are your weapons. Bolt told me that Rook said it was okay to give them back to you. I guess you\u2019ll be needing them anyway if this place comes under attack by demons and all.\u201d He says handing them over to you.\n\nYou cautiously take them while the Shadow Blade just continues to study you.\n\n\u201cI suppose I will be bidding you goodbye and off to defend your distasteful slave market, apparently Rook wants the best of us there. Pity, you seem fairly more interesting now that you\u2019re still alive. I can only imagine what story you must have told Rook for him to believe you as well killing one of his top advisors. Very impressive.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t reply.\n\n\u201cBolt seems to have more doubt judging by his demeanor, but then dwarves tend to be skeptical by nature. Fortunately for you, dwarves are also very loyal and he won\u2019t deviate from Rook\u2019s orders too much.\u201d\n\nYou continue to not respond and just walk past the Shadow Blade.\n\n\u201cTell me, do you think you could take them both?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSimple question. Do you think you could take them both? I mean I\u2019m not counting those idiots at the gate, they wouldn\u2019t get to the fight in time before you or the other two were dead anyway. But without us here, it would be a perfect opportunity to assassinate them. True, they both weld a bit of shadow magic, but let\u2019s be honest\u2026they pale in comparison to a true follower of Fel. And if anything this life has taught me, it\u2019s that anyone can be killed at anytime by anyone. Just need the right combination and the perfect time to strike.\u201d\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me something?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Am I? I thought I was merely asking a question.\u201d\n\u201cYour question is accusatory and I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about with all this assassination business. If you believe that my intentions are not what they seem then why not act?\u201d\n\u201cJust as Bolt follows his orders loyally, I do as well. Not to Rook, but to the Temple and ultimately to Fel. My immediate superior told me to perform a task and that\u2019s to help the Ebony Claw against its enemies wherever possible. It so happens that Rook is the head of the EC so if he wants us elsewhere and for you to stay here, who am I to argue? Perhaps I have misjudged you, if so then apologies my friend.\u201d\n\nThe Shadow Blade leader gives a small bow and leaves.\n\nYou really don\u2019t know what to make of that one. It seems as if he probably knew you were lying, but ultimately didn\u2019t give a shit because he doesn\u2019t really want to be helping the Ebony Claw anyway.\n\nOf course this leave you with the question of whether you SHOULD kill Rook and Bolt now while you have the element of surprise or if you should wait for Tanya because you know it won\u2019t be that long before she decides to attack anyway.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Bolt and Rook", "result": "You still don\u2019t know when Tanya\u2019s going to arrive and you already dodged one close call. The longer you stick around here, the more likely Rook\u2019s going to figure out why you\u2019re really here.\n\nTime to end this now.\n\nYou return to Rook who is currently going through a few of Lloyd\u2019s books. Bolt is nowhere to be found, though for all you know he\u2019s around somewhere in the room.\n\nHe\u2019s going to be the dangerous one, because as soon as you kill Rook, he\u2019s going to be firing on you from somewhere. You\u2019ll have do some sort of acrobatics when you take Rook by surprise.\n\nMeanwhile Rook is just shaking his head as he tosses one of the books aside.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even be bothered to go through this shit right now.\u201d Rook says.\n\nYou don\u2019t reply, you just unload several bullets into his chest before he can even react. You then duck and roll to the side hoping that you\u2019ll avoid getting hit by Bolt\u2019s crossbow.\n\nRook\u2019s body drops to the floor and you also hear the noise of a bolt going into Rook\u2019s desk. If you hadn\u2019t moved, that would have gone right into you.\n\nYou turn around and fire from your prone position, but Bolt once again blinks out of sight. Having the disadvantage again, you now duck behind Rook\u2019s desk and attempt to push his body aside.\n\nTo your surprise, Rook isn\u2019t quite dead yet!\n\n\u201cYou\u2026(wheeze) fuck\u2026\u201d he utters as he weakly grabs you with one hand and attempts to get his eye patch off with the other. You have no idea why he\u2019s doing that, but you hardly care.\n\nYou briefly struggle with Rook and put another bullet in him, this time to his face, which certainly kills him this time. However your victory is short lived since it gave Bolt just enough time to reload and run over to your location and put a bolt through the back of your neck.\n\nYou actually manage to survive just long enough to see a winged figure crash through the large window in the room before your vision goes completely black forever.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Wait for Tanya", "result": "Very tempting, but while you think you could get the drop on one, you don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to get both of them, which you suppose answers the Shadow Blade\u2019s question earlier.\n\nWhen Tanya is here though, you\u2019ll better be able to take advantage of the situation. You just hope you haven\u2019t misjudged her and she\u2019ll actually rethink her position on attacking Rook, though if enough time passes, you\u2019re going to just have to risk acting on your own anyway.\n\nYou return to Rook who is currently going through a few of Lloyd\u2019s books. Bolt is nowhere to be found, though for all you know he\u2019s around somewhere in the room.\n\nRook is just shaking his head as he tosses one of the books aside.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even be bothered to go through this shit right now.\u201d Rook says.\n\u201cProbably all bullshit anyway considering Lloyd was stealing from the Syndicate.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah well at this point I\u2019m starting to think if Lloyd had just cut me in on that deal as well he might still be alive, because I\u2019m seriously starting to wonder why I\u2019m bothering anymore. It\u2019s obvious that I am not getting the support I need and it\u2019s almost like Holgard is an afterthought for them. I mean if they don\u2019t even want a fucking chapter here then fine with me, I got other interests.\u201d\n\nRook doesn\u2019t elaborate on that, but you stay silent. Rook watches you for a moment and then speaks again.\n\n\u201cFuck it, you\u2019ve been one of the few that\u2019s actually been useful to me. How do you feel about starting something new?\u201d Rook asks.\n\u201cNew how?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking a new organization. I mean this revolution is going to be over eventually and frankly after everything that\u2019s gone on, I\u2019m not seeing a good reason to even stay with the Ebony Claw Syndicate anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIf we went out on our own, aren\u2019t we going to have to worry about retaliation?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but fuck. How is going to be any different than any other rival? They obviously don\u2019t even give that much of a shit about this place anyway and we\u2019ll have a complete monopoly on the underworld here. We will definitely be entrenched and they\u2019ll have to send an army which I don\u2019t see them doing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the Temple of Fel? I mean I\u2019m still hazy on how what the ECS and their temple\u2019s relationship is, but aren\u2019t they allies?\u201d\n\u201cNot as close as you think and as I am a dedicated follower to Fel, I believe my strong relationship to them would help me more. At worst they would stay neutral. At best, well let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve got very strong ties to the temple here and I know for a fact that being aligned with Fel is going to be the way of the future here in Holgard. I don\u2019t take it you\u2019re a believer yet though.\u201d\n\u201cWell not as such no, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t be one to piss any of his faithful off.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well that\u2019s a start\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly the large window behind Rook shatters as two small fireballs break through. Still being near the doorway, you\u2019re not in immediate danger, but you duck behind the entryway anyway.\n\nYou peek around the corner and see Rook\u2019s desk full of books on fire, and Rook himself has fallen flat on the ground, but otherwise unhurt.\n\nThen you see her fly in.\n\nIt\u2019s Tanya and her transformation is now complete. Gone are any vestiges of \u201cmodesty\u201d as she\u2019s completely naked. Her skin has become a deep red, she has shiny black wings, and her horns are certainly prominent through her long white hair.\n\nShe has sharp teeth that now accompany her deadly seductress face and sharp talons far superior to any manmade weapon she might\u2019ve used at one time.\n\nNot that she necessarily needs them because apparently she can create little fireballs from her palms and is preparing to throw another at Rook.\n\nRook rips off his eye patch revealing a black gem which he then directs his attention to Tanya and blasts her with a beam of black energy. Halting her fireball attack for a moment.\n\nWasting no time, you enter the room and shoot Rook several times with your pistol. He doesn\u2019t even know what hit him as the bullets hit his body and he slumps to the floor.\n\nYou then feel a bolt going into your back and then another one just narrowly grazing the back of your head. You fall to the floor and you probably would be dead right there if not for Tanya who has already recovered from Rook\u2019s attack.\n\nYou don\u2019t see what happens next, but you certainly hear it when a guttural scream is heard followed by the sound of flesh being ripped, bones being cracked and then a piece of arm being tossed over your head.\n\nThen you soon feel the bolt in your back being forcefully pulled out, followed by her hand touching the wound and burning it, causing you to yell out. You close your eyes and breathe hard for a moment trying to ignore the pain and then you\u2019re suddenly lifted up.\n\n\u201cFoolish mortal, you could have gotten yourself killed.\u201d Tanya growls and then with you in her arms, she takes flight back out the window. You look down on the city from the sky and it\u2019s a surreal feeling. You might even appreciate it if you weren\u2019t in a lot of pain right now.\n\nYou fly around for a bit and eventually she starts her decent downward. Because you\u2019re not quite used to this sensation you close your eyes again almost thinking you\u2019re going smash in the ground.\n\nInstead however, she lands near the abandoned and semi-ruined inn the Lighthouse and places you on one of the empty beds there.\n\n\u201cCan you move around? Can you feel anything?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cFuck, of course I can feel, my whole fucking body hurts, especially my back. As far as moving around is concerned, yeah, I can, but I don\u2019t fucking want to. See? I\u2019m moving my foot!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, good. At least you\u2019re not paralyzed then. I would have hated to have to put you out of your misery.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have been fun for me either. Sheesh. You couldn\u2019t just heal me you\u2019re your new infernal magic abilities instead?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know I don\u2019t have that ability and I doubt healing magic is something that most infernals have anyway given their destructive nature.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nYou wince in pain as you attempt to shift position on the bed. Tanya just looks at you with a stare that feels very oppressive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re just looking on me with distain of how weak of a human I am right about now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo\u2026well partly that, but I was thinking more of how this was where we spent our first time of intimacy together. That was such a special moment for me, in more ways than one I think.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I think it became a turning point in my reluctance to accept my heritage. I started to realize that I really should be embracing my potential not hiding from it. Something definitely changed that\u2019s for sure, but I suppose not everything did.\u201d\n\nTanya holds your hand, which is very warm to the touch. When you look at her face again, you can still sort of see the old Tanya there. You still feel very close to her, though you\u2019re a little worried about what might come next.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay here.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cI can see how a flying demon might very well attract attention in a civilized area.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNot just this city. This\u2026world. I\u2019m feeling very drawn to my roots as it were. Never thought I\u2019d be longing to go to such an awful place, but I feel I must, if only to learn more about myself.\u201d\n\u201cI see. So you\u2019re going home then? Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cI feel like I should be able to soon. When I do leave, you\u2019ll probably experience a bit of a longing, but I think it shouldn\u2019t be too crippling. The further away I am from you physically the better you\u2019ll be able to get over it and move on.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get over it when I first saw you. You really think I\u2019m going to now? You said we bonded.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we did\u2026though I don\u2019t believe this is going to impact you as much as it will me. My bond with you is only supposed to be temporary so I can access you better at which point I should be draining your life force and eating your soul, or whatever it is I\u2019m supposed to do. I can\u2019t very well go around being a proper succubus if I\u2019m monogamous.\u201d\n\u201cI sort of was afraid you\u2019d say something like that.\u201d\n\nTanya\u2019s hand releases yours and moves over you to your face. You fully expect her to do something violent, but instead she just caresses your cheek.\n\n\u201cYou worry too much, I\u2019m severely broken anyway. If I had embraced all this years before when my mother first approached me, then you might have cause for concern. However, there\u2019s still too much ugh\u2026mortal in me. I am forever going to be at war with myself, though perhaps it\u2019s this internal struggle and late blooming that\u2019s causing my rapid transformation and surge in power. I look at you for example and still feel love. I shouldn\u2019t, but I do. I even hate myself a little for being so weak, but at the same time I don\u2019t care. All these conflicting thoughts and torment are probably helping me be a better infernal because hatred, even self-hatred is a great quality to have as an infernal.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re not going to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cNot today, probably not ever. I shall learn to live with this weakness and I\u2019ll refocus my energy into other worthy endeavors. Fucking men and leading them astray isn\u2019t something I find all that appealing anyway. Besides, you\u2019re human and your kind have pitifully short life spans. You\u2019ll live, what? Sixty more years at most and in your case of being a professional criminal, it is doubtful you\u2019ll live to old age. Then after you\u2019re dead, there will be no more weakness. I can be patient. It\u2019s a good trait for an infernal anyway.\u201d\n\nYou nearly laugh at how matter a factly Tanya says this.\n\n\u201cWell I appreciate your patience Tanya, and it\u2019s certainly better than the alternative.\u201d\n\nTanya sits next to you on the bed and now her eyes look less hard, the non-infernal side is showing.\n\n\u201cOur time together wasn\u2019t long enough.\u201d She says with sadness.\n\u201cMaybe, but I enjoyed what time there was. Besides, you said it yourself that we\u2019re bonded. So our time together isn\u2019t really over, it\u2019s just different I suppose.\u201d You say.\n\nTanya hugs you, and you ignore the pain you feel when she applies her squeeze around you. She then carefully kisses you on the lips. You don\u2019t even feel the drain.\n\nShe then wipes her eyes and stands up.\n\n\u201cMove on from me. Goodbye my love.\u201d She says and leaves.\n\nYou continue to lie on the bed mostly motionless just thinking about how she\u2019s really gone now and allow yourself to weep a bit. Eventually enough time passes that you get ahold of yourself and you feel a little rested enough to sit up.\n\nYou reach into your small bag still on your person and check to see if you\u2019ve still got your water skin or food since you\u2019re getting a little hungry and thirsty\n\nAs you\u2019re rummaging through, you find something you definitely didn\u2019t put in there. A large black gem. Actually it\u2019s a little sticky from blood on it, but this could only be from Rook\u2019s eye socket.\n\nTanya must have ripped it out while you had your eyes closed from after she pulled the bolt from your back. You never felt her put anything in your bag though, then again you weren\u2019t exactly paying attention.\n\nYou smile at this parting gift from Tanya.\n\n\u201cGoodbye Tanya.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 23\n\nYou take a moment to catch your breath after running from the guards. Warts soon joins you, though he\u2019s got more on his mind than just catching his breath.\n\n\u201cWhat da hell? Youz wuz just gonna leave me there?!\u201d he says.\n\u201cWarts, they didn\u2019t even see you, they only saw me, and I figured you\u2019d be fine anyway. And look, I was right, you\u2019re here to bitch at me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBullshit. Anyways, youz wouldn\u2019t have alerted the guards if youz wuz a better thief!\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, I\u2019m a fucking fantastic thief! I was part of the Guild AND the Syndicate!\u201d\n\u201cYeah? And where are they now?\u201d\n\u201cBoth gone, while I outlasted both organizations.\u201d\n\u201cHm, from what youz told me, sounds more like you destroyed them both. No wonder nobody else wants to work with you. Youz a jinx.\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you still willing to work with me?\u201d\n\u201cCuz I got Yag wit me always. Sides, it\u2019s usually more profitable than working with the Spider Fangs nowadays. Idjits too busy warring with da elves rather than simple banditry. Not hangin\u2019 around for dat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your guide gig?\u201d\n\u201cBah, nobody gets lost like they used to. Dat Baroness has mades effort to chop a lotta trees in da surrounding area and make a road as opposed to the simple dirt path it once had.\u201d\n\u201cYeah Baroness Varsakken is unfortunately a lot more efficient than her father was. Been a steady increase in security in the city making life harder in general. Miss the days when they wouldn\u2019t even bother you or you could easily just bribe them.\u201d\n\u201cDat\u2019s becuz there\u2019s no organizations anymore. Without da Syndicate or even the Guild around, the criminal element here is easy pickin\u2019 for da guvment. No need to appease or even profit from them. Easier ta just execute or toss \u2018em in prison.\u201d\n\nWarts never appears to be bright a lot of times, but it\u2019s insight like that which always reminds you that he isn\u2019t as stupid as he tries to pretend.\n\nHe\u2019s right of course. The criminal element has been disorganized ever since the city pulled back from anarchy and Baroness Ludmilla Varsakken took power from her father Vlad and brother Farad (And most certainly had a hand in killing them both).\n\nThe Ebony Claw Syndicate chapter here never regrouped. None of the members who survived (And were mostly the lower ranks anyway), ever tried to reform and seemed to just go their own way. The ECS leadership back in the Delantium Kingdom never came back to \u201creclaim\u201d their chapter either. You assume that they wrote this place off as a loss and moved on.\n\nInitially this all seemed pretty ideal, as you were no longer under their threats or watchful eye and at the time the Holgard Watch was still fairly weak and recovering from the anarchy.\n\nIn time though, it turned out Ludmilla was far more competent and more pragmatic than her father and started actually focusing on making the city safer and less of pit of crime and disorder that it\u2019s become known for. Which in turn is making your profession a bit harder.\n\nThe more you think about it, you\u2019re starting to wonder about what the hell you\u2019re doing with your own life and it isn\u2019t exactly as good as it could be.\n\nThis living day to day without thinking about the future was okay before, but now you\u2019re starting realize that maybe you should be rethinking your simplistic approach to life. Because even if you\u2019re still a good enough thief to evade the law and trouble most of the time, you\u2019re getting a little bored of doing it. Something different might be in order.\n\nYou think again back to just a few years ago and the fact that you were part of not one but two criminal organizations. You didn\u2019t give it too much thought at the time, mainly because you were thinking more about Tanya, but sometimes you wondered what it would be like to be running said organizations.\n\nGiven how Garrick and Rook ended up, you have to believe that you\u2019d do just as good of a job as they did, maybe even better.\n\nMaybe YOU could form a new organization. If you did, you\u2019d certainly bring in more money and strengthen the underworld here again. Maybe you could even influence the government like the Ebony Claw Syndicate and the Guild once did.\n\n\u201cWarts, I think I should form an organization.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWut? Dat\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cCuz, more people around, more problems, dat\u2019s why! I mean you should know dat better than anywun! Besides, I know too, Spider Fang tribe, full of idjits, why you think I stay to myself a lot?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they don\u2019t truly accept you from what you told me, and besides didn\u2019t you tell me the Spider Fang tribe survived when others didn\u2019t because they worked together the best?\u201d\n\u201cTru\u2026but they probably gettin\u2019 demselves killed by warring with da elves. Sides, ain\u2019t nobody gonna follow youz. Youz a jinx remember? Anyone left from the Syndicate isn\u2019t likely ta like ya.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well they don\u2019t need to like me, they just need to fear and believe in me. You forget, I was known as a Claw killer before I joined. I mean that should still count as a serious reputation.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026but I dunno\u2026seems like ya just invitin\u2019 trouble.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be any worse than what I\u2019ve already been through.\u201d\n\u201cHm, so whatcha callin\u2019 it?\u201d\n\u201cCalling what?\u201d\n\u201cYer gang, ya idjit. Geez.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Shit, guess I should come up with a name. Fuck. Can\u2019t think of one right now.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a great start.\u201d\n\u201cForget the name for now, what we need to do is gather up everyone.\u201d\n\u201cWe? I didn\u2019t agree ta dis.\u201d\n\u201cWarts, you\u2019ll fucking help me, because I\u2019ve saved your damn life on more than one occasion.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, if I\u2019d known you\u2019d become such a fucking asshole, I woulda left ya ta rot in the woods years ago. Alright, fine. I\u2019ll help, but only becuz I ain\u2019t got anything better ta do right now. I ain\u2019t getting\u2019 tied down in dis little organization of yers either, assumin\u2019 it even gets off da ground to begin wit. So whatcha need?\u201d\n\nSeeing as you don\u2019t want to be bothered hunting down every petty criminal in Holgard, you assign Warts that task. As strange as it may seem, he can be fairly convincing to those of similar low status.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019re of the mind that you need to find a suitable headquarters. You suppose you could just \u201ctake over\u201d the current inn you\u2019re living at. It wouldn\u2019t take much to intimidate the owner, though your bigger concern is visibility. Gone are the days where organizations like the ECS could just sit out in the open and the Watch would turn a blind eye. You\u2019d have to be more careful to keep up the appearance of legitimacy.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019d like to use the old Thieves\u2019 Guild location. The problem with that is it\u2019s currently an underground slave market and run by the closest thing to a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d still left in Holgard.\n\nWhen word of Rook being dead spread, remnants of ECS members that had been assigned to the slave market just stayed there and went into business for themselves. Some of the other members joined soon after. It\u2019s one of the few things that the Holgard Watch has not been efficient in eliminating. Though the location never was known to general law enforcement anyway.\n\nFrom what you know, they\u2019re little more than a gang of thugs, but they\u2019re organized enough that they\u2019ve lasted this long and even have ties to certain pirate groups based in Hessla.\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine that convincing them is going to be easy, in fact you might have to wait a bit before trying. Go there when you\u2019ve built up a bit more muscle as a show of force.\n\nOf course you could just go in now and shoot everyone. Probably a lot more dangerous and you\u2019d be depriving yourself of possible followers, but if you\u2019re successful, you\u2019d certainly establish yourself as the big swinging dick of the underworld, along with taking over the territory you wanted in the first place.", "action_results": [{"action": "Patience and Diplomacy", "result": "If you\u2019re really serious about doing this, then going in guns blazing might be counter productive, even fatal if you\u2019re attempting to do it alone.\n\nBetter you should at least make some other alliances first before taking on the slavers.\n\nWhile you\u2019re mentally preparing yourself for this potential problem for later, Warts is still around asking you questions.\n\n\u201cAy, youz still with me?\u201d Warts asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah, just deep in thought.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, never had dat problem. Anywayz I was askin\u2019 where ya gonna hold dis meetin\u2019 of Holgard\u2019s most wanted, an when?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Just tell them to come to the Blackheart Inn, where I\u2019m currently staying by the weekend. That should give you enough time to scout the streets, taverns, and wherever else. Oh and let them know that the drinks will be on me, so that should help entice them as well.\u201d\n\u201cBlackheart Inn\u2026why the hell don\u2019t these inns ever have invitin\u2019 names? Like I dunno, the friendly titties, or sumthin.\u201d\n\u201cBecause that name was taken by one of the brothels presumably. Anyway, I leave you to it. I probably should start preparing what I\u2019m going to say. Ugh, wish my sister was here, she\u2019d probably be able to write an inspiring speech for me or something.\u201d\n\nYou leave Warts and head home to the Blackheart Inn. On your way to your room, you toss a bag of coins to the innkeeper stating that you\u2019re going to be having a \u201cgathering\u201d on the weekend and you need . He doesn\u2019t ask questions since he knows by now what sort of man you are and more importantly all the coin you\u2019ve given him is understanding enough.\n\nDays pass and eventually the time has come for you to convince everyone that they need to join you. You aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s going to be entirely successful, but hopefully you can convince most of them if only to mount an assault on the slavers.\n\n\u201cAy, I gotz a lotta people here. Aren\u2019t ya comin ta make a speech \u2018bout a glorious future or sumthin?\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019m establishing how things are going to work already. THEY will wait for ME. They\u2019re at my beck and call, not the other way around.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYeah? Well I still say ya betta hurry up. A lot ain\u2019t dat patient.\u201d\n\u201cDuly noted. I\u2019ll be there soon. Just let them know.\u201d\n\nYou head to the large back room of the inn, where you\u2019re met by several criminal types. A lot of them have already been drinking heavily. Some nod at you with respect, while others not so much.\n\n\u201cOh \u2018ere he is. Fuckin\u2019 thought you\u2019d never show up.\u201d One says.\n\u201cYeah, you drag us all here sayin\u2019 it\u2019s important and then don\u2019t even show up on time for yer own meeting.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cHell, if it wasn\u2019t for him payin\u2019 for da ale, I wouldn\u2019t even be here. So what\u2019s dis all about?\u201d A third says.\n\u201cGlad you asked. You see, while Warts was inviting you all here in a civilized manner to join me, I was planning for all of our futures.\u201d You say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cWait a minute, did you say join you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m rebuilding an organization for us and you\u2019re all invited to join and get richer than you are.\u201d\n\nThis response is met with a lot of derision.\n\n\u201cJoin you?! I see you\u2019ve been drinking too!\u201d one laughs.\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m not flattered by the offer, but weren\u2019t you part of the Syndicate AND the Guild? Seems suspicious that both were destroyed while you\u2019re still here.\u201d Another adds.\n\u201cYeah, and I was part of the Syndicate once too. Not for very long, but long enough to remember that you were killing them at one time. Some of those guys were my fucking friends! Okay, maybe not friends, but a couple owed me money which I\u2019ll never fucking get back now!\u201d a third says.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get that money back and more if you just follow me. I have a vision for this city and if we unify we could be greater than the Guild or the Syndicate ever was!\u201d\n\u201cYeah an maybe the elf queen will let me fuck her in the ass while we\u2019re at it. This is a lot of bullshit. I\u2019m doing fine on my own.\u201d\n\nAt this point you try to go into the benefits of uniting, but barely anyone is listening. Even the ones that are more receptive have their issues.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t a nice idea, but I\u2019m still not seeing why we should be following you. I mean I know you\u2019ve got a bit of a reputation as a skilled killer and I\u2019m certainly not going to fuck with you, but there\u2019s a difference between being a killer and a leader. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that you\u2019re a leader.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cYeah, I mean I\u2019d sooner join up with Elias who runs the slave market. The only reason why I haven\u2019t is because he\u2019s a fucking asshole.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cGlad you brought that up, because Elias\u2019 days are numbered. I intend on taking him out.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah? You and what army?\u201d\n\u201cUs! I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying this whole time! If we join forces, nobody can stop us! Taking out Elias and taking his wealth and his place is just the first step in getting this new organization up and running. So? Who\u2019s with me?\u201d\n\nNot many apparently, as most of them don\u2019t even bother replying and just leave.\n\n\u201cWhat seriously? We could fucking take him together!\u201d you exclaim in anger.\n\u201cMaybe, maybe not, but again, I don\u2019t see why we should be following you to do it. A lot of us are still going to get killed and for what? There\u2019s no profit in this.\u201d\n\u201cI just explained there\u2019s a shitload of profit in this!\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not convinced and I don\u2019t think most of us are either. I mean if you got the balls to go take him out yourself, then I\u2019ll be the first one to sign up afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cIf I take him out myself, then you might want to worry about your future in this city for rejecting my offer now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I guess I\u2019ll have to deal with that when it comes to pass.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll deal with it now!\u201d\n\nYou pull out your pistol and shoot the man you were speaking to in the back. This is soon followed by several other people pulling their own weapons and others just outright running away. You put down those that attack you and probably scared everyone, but you don\u2019t think you convinced anyone. Even Warts apparently ran off during the shooting.\n\nYou curse that this didn\u2019t go better. The owner of the Blackheart is pissed enough that he yells about you ruining his place with a mess of bodies. He surprisingly even has the courage to say you\u2019re no longer welcome to stay in his establishment and possibly bringing heat down on his place.\n\nYou don\u2019t bother arguing; you already know what you have to do. You need to just take out Elias and after you do that, you\u2019ll have your own place, everyone else will fall in line and that will be that. Patience and diplomacy have failed.\n\nYou go to your room and pack all your shit. In particular all the firearms you\u2019ve acquired and head to another inn to get a night\u2019s rest before taking on the slavers.\n\nThe next night, with all your gear, you head to the nearest sewer entrance and descend down. You still remember the way to the Thieves Guild so it doesn\u2019t take long.\n\nWhen you get closer to where the entrance would be located you start to wonder where anyone is since surely there would be guards or lookouts posted outside to let people in (or keep people out).\n\nYou approach the entrance and then you hear footstep behind you.\n\nYou turn around and open fire managing to hit one of your assailants while the others duck behind the walls.\n\nThe door to the slave market then opens up and you just narrowly avoid getting blasted with a musket. You fall to the floor and manage to put another attacker down with your pistol, but it\u2019s apparent that someone from last night\u2019s meeting tipped off Elias because his people were waiting for you.\n\nYou scramble back to your feet, but you\u2019re in a very bad position. You\u2019re trapped in a narrow corridor with people shooting at you behind and ahead. Even with your skills, you have no cover and you soon take a couple shots that put you down.\n\nRefusing to give up you manage to get off one more shot before Elias\u2019 people finally finish you off.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Ruthless Aggression", "result": "Well, shooting people is something you\u2019re good at, so it might actually be easier anyway.\n\nThough you hope you aren\u2019t too rusty at it, you haven\u2019t been doing as much shooting as you once did. (And as much as it might be more convenient at times, openly killing Holgard Watchmen on a whim is likely to get you hunted down a lot quicker) Still, you do try to keep in practice in the sewers where nobody gives a shit if you\u2019re firing off a weapon you\u2019re not supposed to own anyway.\n\nYou\u2019ve also acquired a few other firearms over the years as well. You\u2019ve got a musket, a blunderbuss, and various other one shot flintlocks.\n\nYou might as well bring them all for this, because you\u2019re not going in subtle.\n\nWhile you\u2019re mentally preparing yourself for this assault in your head, Warts is still around asking you questions.\n\n\u201cAy, youz still with me?\u201d Warts asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah, just deep in thought.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, never had dat problem. Anywayz I was askin\u2019 where ya gonna hold dis meetin\u2019 of Holgard\u2019s most wanted, an when?\u201d\n\u201cOh.

Look, I\u2019m leaving you to it, I gotta go get ready.\u201d\n\u201cReady for what?\u201d\n\u201cI got my own shit to do before this meeting. Later.\u201d\n\nYou leave Warts and head home to the Blackheart Inn. On your way to your room, you toss a bag of coins to the innkeeper stating that you\u2019re going to be having a \u201cgathering\u201d on the weekend and you need . He doesn\u2019t ask questions since he knows by now what sort of man you are and more importantly all the coin you\u2019ve given him is understanding enough.\n\nYou go to your room and after moving about furniture to access your items, you check everything and load it all up. You then get some rest, because tomorrow you\u2019ve got big plans.\n\nThe next night, with all your gear, you head to the nearest sewer entrance and descend down. You still remember the way to the Thieves Guild so it doesn\u2019t take long.\n\nNo sooner do you get closer to where the entrance would be located and several of the slavers are hanging around.\n\n\u201cShit! He\u2019s got\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore any of them can make a move or sound other than a scream, you\u2019ve shot your blunderbuss and taken out three of them with the spread. You finish off the fourth severely wounded one on the ground with blade to his neck.\n\nYou can\u2019t be sure if that\u2019s already alerted more of them, but you enter quickly. As soon as you do, you\u2019ve draw attention not from the ones running the market, but from some of the potential buyers. More than a few just run for cover, others foolishly draw on you, which you return in kind.\n\nAs you get closer to the hub, more of the slavers appear to defend their territory. A few of them are armed with crossbows and their own firearms, so you take a nearby customer and use him as a meat shield. He screams the entire time until he finally takes a shot to his head, splattering part of his brains on you.\n\nYou toss away the body and shoot several more of your assailants with your pistol.\n\nAt this point the market is in chaos. People are running everywhere and a couple mini-fights have broke out, including a couple of the livelier slaves that are taking advantage of this situation.\n\nEventually you\u2019ve shot and stabbed enough people and the rest have either fled or cowering somewhere. All things considered, you haven\u2019t been wounded too badly in all this. You guess you never lose your touch on some things.\n\n\u201cHEY! HEY! STOP SHOOTING! CAN\u2019T WE COME TO A DEAL?!\u201d a female voice shouts.\n\u201cPerhaps. You the leader of this lot?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cNo, you shot off half of his fucking face five minutes ago. Though, I guess maybe I am now. I\u2019m Vera. What the hell do you even want?\u201d\n\u201cI want this place, that\u2019s what I want.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah? Well most of the fucking slaves just got killed thanks to you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the slaves. I want this territory! This whole fucking area and eventually the city. I\u2019m putting together a new underworld organization to be a real force in Holgard again and this would be a good spot for the main base of operations.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? Well I\u2019m not sure if murdering potential members was a good way to go about it.\u201d\n\u201cAn example had to be made and you lot were the strongest. The sad fact of life is our kind only ever really respond to is fear and strength, so this was entirely necessary.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure the entire world works that way, still I can\u2019t argue with your logic. Look, I know who you are. We actually met when you were working for the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cWe did?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, back at Rook\u2019s mansion, you came by with a bag of bloody heads and threatened to rape and kill me if I didn\u2019t let you in.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026oh yeah, I remember that. Um, I wasn\u2019t really going to rape you, I would have just killed you. I was just trying to be threatening to get my point across.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well you\u2019re really good at that obviously. Look, you\u2019re not getting any problems from me or whoever else you left alive. So you want this place? Fine, I ain\u2019t fucking dying for it.\u201d\n\nWell that was easier than you thought.\n\n\u201cOkay. That\u2019s good. What about my offer?\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh, you mean the one about creating a new criminal empire and joining you? Uh\u2026well do I really have a choice?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, unless you want to leave the city entirely.\u201d\n\u201cHm, how generous of you. Fuck it, I guess I\u2019m in, can\u2019t speak for anyone else still alive though. I just hope you do as good of a job in a leadership position as you are at killing people.\u201d\n\u201cGuess we\u2019ll find out together. In the meantime, clean this place up and sell off whatever remaining slaves you have. If we do get back into that business, it\u2019ll have to be done elsewhere. In any case, expect me and a bunch of others to be moving in here by the weekend. I suggest you take second best room you can. That\u2019s it for now, but before I go, I need to take something first.\u201d\n\nAfter some quick looting of bodies and few other tasks, you give Vera a few more instructions who seems to readily comply to anything you command. She\u2019s just glad she survived your attack (Again it would seem).\n\nYou soon return back to the Blackheart Inn and make a request to the innkeeper before retiring to your room.\n\nYou take steps in coming up with potential plans and ideas of how to organize all this for the remaining week. While you hope Warts has managed to convince a lot of people to come to this gathering, you\u2019re confident that even if that isn\u2019t the case, in time many will eventually flock to you.\n\nWhen the night of the gathering comes, you don\u2019t make an appearance right away. Eventually Warts comes to get you.\n\n\u201cAy, I gotz a lotta people here. Aren\u2019t ya comin ta make a speech \u2018bout a glorious future or sumthin?\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019m establishing how things are going to work already. THEY will wait for ME. They\u2019re at my beck and call, not the other way around.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYeah? Well I still say ya betta hurry up. A lot ain\u2019t dat patient.\u201d\n\u201cDuly noted. I\u2019ll be there soon. Just let them know.\u201d\n\nWarts nods and heads off. Meanwhile you go see the innkeeper about something and he gets a large bag out of his icebox.\n\n\u201cGlad to be rid of that thing.\u201d He says.\n\nWith the bag over your shoulder, you head to the large back room of the inn, where you\u2019re met by several criminal types. A lot of them have already been drinking heavily. Some nod at you with respect, while others not so much.\n\n\u201cOh \u2018ere he is. Fuckin\u2019 thought you\u2019d never show up.\u201d One says.\n\u201cYeah, you drag us all here sayin\u2019 it\u2019s important and then don\u2019t even show up on time for yer own meeting.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cHell, if it wasn\u2019t for him payin\u2019 for da ale, I wouldn\u2019t even be here. So what\u2019s in da bag?\u201d A third says.\n\u201cGlad you asked. You see, while Warts was inviting you all here in a civilized manner to join me, I was having a discussion with a group that might be less willing to see reason\u2026\u201d You say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cWait a minute, did you say join you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m rebuilding an organization for us and you\u2019re all invited to join and get richer than you are.\u201d\n\nThis response is met with a lot of derision.\n\n\u201cJoin you?! I see you\u2019ve been drinking too!\u201d one laughs.\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m not flattered by the offer, but weren\u2019t you part of the Syndicate AND the Guild? Seems suspicious that both were destroyed while you\u2019re still here.\u201d Another adds.\n\u201cYeah, and I was part of the Syndicate once too. Not for very long, but long enough to remember that you were killing them at one time. Some of those guys were my fucking friends! Okay, maybe not friends, but a couple owed me money which I\u2019ll never fucking get back now!\u201d a third says.\n\u201cAnd as I said, stick with me and you\u2019ll get richer than you are, now don\u2019t anyone fucking interrupt again. As I was saying, I was having a discussion with a group that might be less willing to see reason than you lot, so I took it upon myself to take matters into my own hands. Hope none of you were into slaves, because the market might be closed for awhile.\u201d You say.\n\nYou then dump the contents of the bag on the floor and several bloody frozen heads roll out. This is met by gasps, shock, silence and one person surprisingly even throws up.\n\n\u201cBy fucking Yag\u2019s loaded dice. That one\u2019s Ellis! He ran the slave market!\u201d one says.\n\u201cAre you sure? Half of its face is blown off. Ugh.\u201d Another remarks.\n\u201cEither way, he sure killed a lot of people. Fucking hell\u2026\u201d a third says.\n\nYou clear your throat to call the attention back to you and off the heads you just dropped on the floor.\n\n\u201cYes gentlemen, I did kill a lot of people and if you\u2019d like to not be on that list, you\u2019ll either join me or get the hell out my way. Because it\u2019s like this; I really want to be in charge. Are there any objections?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the people look at each other in silence wondering if anyone is going to protest, but nobody does.\n\n\u201cVery well. Let\u2019s get to it then shall we?\u201d\n\nAnd so you take your next steps in building a new criminal organization.\n\n(You\u2019re still having trouble thinking up a good name though)", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\nThings could always be better of course, but all things considered the Nocturnal League is doing well under your leadership. You actually managed to surprise yourself. Reminds you of when your father once told you that you could do very well anything if you just applied yourself.\n\nWell you did, but you\u2019re pretty sure he didn\u2019t have this in mind.\n\nOf course part of your success isn\u2019t just all your own talent. It probably helps that the city is once again experiencing an inner conflict. Not a revolution or anything like that, but more of a religious faction war. Holgard has always had a bit of a problem with religion and it\u2019s the fact that there is too much of it in the city.\n\nIt didn\u2019t start off as violent as its become, but its been bad enough that the Holgard Watch has been more focused on breaking up fights between religious factions and members in the streets than keeping an eye on crime and happily, the Holgard Watch has slowly started to revert back to their corrupt ways. Not enough like the old days, but enough that they aren\u2019t as much of a problem anymore.\n\nAs for your organization\u2019s role in the current religious squabble, you\u2019ve managed to keep out of it so far and you\u2019ve told everyone else to do likewise. This is mainly towards a few ex-Syndicate members that still have leanings towards the Temple of Fel. Though more than a few in your group give a few prayers to Yag too and while you\u2019ve been known to do the same from time to time, you aren\u2019t looking to side with them either.\n\nAt least not unless there is some profitable reason for doing so.\n\nIn any case, there are also other areas some of your more enterprising members have been trying to convince you of expanding into.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, we really should bring slave market back. It brought in a lot of coin when it existed and I\u2019m fairly certain I could convince some of those Hessla pirates to bring their business here again.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cFeh, if it did all that well, why weren\u2019t you rich?\u201d Warts asks.\n\u201cBecause Elias was a bastard boss that kept most of the money and then would promptly blow it all on alcohol and Blue Dream. I know with a more levelheaded person like our current boss running things, a new slave market could be even more profitable.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, such obvious flattery. Why don\u2019t ya just suck his dick while ya at it?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off Warts, why the hell is this half breed even still allowed around here? He\u2019s always claiming he isn\u2019t really part of the League anyway.\u201d\n\u201cEh, Warts likes to play the role of a freelance outsider, mainly because he\u2019s been doing it for so long he\u2019s comfortable in that role. Nevermind the fact that deep down inside he wants to be part of a tribe. And that\u2019s us, though he\u2019ll never admit that, right Warts?\u201d you say.\n\u201cRight. No wait! I\u2019m not part of the League! Fuck, youz twisted my words! Anyway, slave market is a bad idea, too much upkeep, an\u2019 too much trouble ta capture people. Youz should just expand outside the city and send sum people ta rob the merchants on da road.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cOh, brilliant idea. Since when the hell did we become a bunch of unsophisticated bandits?\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cGiven the lot we have, I don\u2019t think sophisticated is exactly the word that would describe most here.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cWell you may be right, but come on, don\u2019t you think we\u2019re at least above that sort of guileless criminal activity? Besides, you send some of these people out there to do that and it isn\u2019t like you can keep as good of an eye on them. If they get successful enough, they may just decide to keep everything and fuck off elsewhere leaving us with nothing.\u201d\n\nAs with most ideas, everything has its pros and cons, you need to think about all this a lot more. You tell Warts and Vera this and while Warts happily leaves your office to go about his own hobbies, Vera stays behind.\n\n\u201cIs there something else?\u201d you ask.\n\nVera goes over to the door and locks it, which immediately causes you to draw on her.\n\n\u201cShit! What the hell man?\u201d she exclaims raising her hands up.\n\u201cWhat the hell indeed, you\u2019re the one locking the door and acting all suspicious.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to assassinate you if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, I just wanna talk to you a little more privately so we aren\u2019t interrupted.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what? I told you I\u2019d think about your proposal.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I REALLY think I can convince you that my idea is a good one.\u201d\n\nAt this point Vera starts unbuttoning her shirt and unsuccessfully attempting to walk seductively towards you and stumbling in the process. It\u2019s pretty embarrassing.\n\n\u201cStop. Stop. Stop. Are you seriously doing what I think you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHey look, I\u2019m not proud. If I gotta suck your dick in order to convince you to set up a new slave market here and make me head slaver, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll fucking do.\u201d\n\u201cHead slaver, interesting choice of words considering this situation. And now you don\u2019t just want me to go with your idea, you want to be in charge of it. That\u2019s pretty presumptuous of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty presumptuous that you won\u2019t, after I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nLooks like she took Wart\u2019s suggestion to heart.\n\nAt this point Vera\u2019s on her knees in front of you and her face is practically making a beeline towards your crotch. While this \u201coffer isn\u2019t completely unenticing, you\u2019ve got some reservations and not just the usual ones.\n\n\u201cVera just stop. This isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d You say pushing her away a bit.\n\u201cWhat? So you wanna fuck me? I mean we can do that too\u2026um you don\u2019t want to do it the other way do you? I mean\u2026if I gotta take it in the ass, (sigh) I will, but you can\u2019t expect me to fake enjoying that.\u201d\n\u201cNo! We\u2019re not doing anything Vera. Just put your tits away and get your hands off my dick.\u201d\n\nWhile this would probably be enough to give most the hint that one isn\u2019t interested, Vera\u2019s a little more persistent.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m confused. Based on my observations of how I\u2019ve seen you look at women, I know damn well you like girls. In fact, I\u2019ve noticed you even checking me out on occasion and your dick was getting hard when I was touching it so I know it can\u2019t be because you find me repulsive. And I doubt if you have any moral objections\u2026\u201d Vera says before you interrupt.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. I like to get to know someone first before being intimate with them. Maybe that sounds weird to someone so free with their\u2026sexual activity, but that\u2019s just how I was raised and some things just stuck with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. We work together, while I don\u2019t pretend that we know everything about each other, we\u2019re not exactly strangers.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t shit where I eat, so if you don\u2019t mind, get the fuck out of here and go blow somebody who cares!\u201d\n\nVera isn\u2019t exactly buying your excuse, but she\u2019s buttoning up her shirt and getting back up.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re the boss and all, but I have to say, sometimes you\u2019re a very poor liar. But, whatever just as long as you\u2019re not chopping my head off to make a point I guess.\u201d\n\nVera lets herself out and you\u2019re breathing a sigh of relief that you didn\u2019t give in since you\u2019re fairly certain you would have, had Vera not left when she did.\n\nYou\u2019ve never told anyone this, but you\u2019re convinced that having sex results in your partner\u2019s death. Not instantly, but there\u2019s been too many incidences for it to be a coincidence.\n\nFor a long time after your parting of ways with Tanya you didn\u2019t even show much interest in other women. Indeed you felt a great loss as if she died and you were in mourning.\n\nTanya however, was correct that in time you\u2019d \u201cget over\u201d her. Maybe not mentally (You can\u2019t help but think about her still) but physically you definitely did.\n\nSo it was with no surprise that during your time before forming the League you went with a few other women from time to time.\n\nAnd every single one of them died.\n\nIn your line of work you tend to bump into the same people and frequent the same places. So you started to get suspicious when women you had been intimate with started always winding up dead\u2026\n\nThe taverns\u2026\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Lucy? Usually she\u2019s serving drinks tonight.\u201d\n\u201cLucy? You didn\u2019t hear? She fell off the docks and drowned two days ago. Tragic.\u201d\n\nThe streets\u2026\n\n\u201cAny of you lot seen Ophelia around?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the new up and coming cutpurse with the cute face and nice ass? She got a bolt to the head a week ago. Found dead in an alley. Damn shame, she had a lot of potential. Fucking tragic.\u201d\n\nAnd especially the brothels\u2026\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like Francine tonight.\u201d\n\u201cFrancine? Oh, you must not have heard. She was found dead of a Yellow Devil overdose a week ago. It\u2019s weird because I made sure none of my girls ever took drugs, let alone that vile stuff. Tragic.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Sorry to hear it. Um, well I guess I\u2019ll take Patricia then.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s no longer with us either. She was murdered by some unknown assailant nearly a month ago. Very tragic.\u201d\n\u201cWell shit\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI might as well tell you too, that Helena is also gone. Died in a house fire yesterday. I tell you, it\u2019s been a tough time for this place lately, but hey we\u2019re always here to please and there are still many lovely girls here. Hey did you want to see Naji? She\u2019s free this time and it\u2019s been years since you indulged in her services. I bet she\u2019d love to see you again. Always said you used to be the best customer she ever had.\u201d\n\u201cUm, no. I gotta go.\u201d\n\nWhile perhaps it is just very bad luck and coincidence that all these ladies that you were intimate with, met tragic deaths, but you feel very certain that this has something to do with being bonded with Tanya. It\u2019s your curse as it were.\n\nIf you were a complete asshole you suppose you wouldn\u2019t give a shit and just think with your dick anyway, but even if you just gave into your base desires, Vera\u2019s useful enough that you\u2019d hate to lose her help in the organization. Besides all that, you half wonder if Tanya is somehow keeping track of you.\n\nGranted you\u2019ve not seen her in person or even a dream ever since she departed to the infernal realm, but she said she\u2019d always be linked to you. What if every girl you\u2019ve fucked is just making her madder and madder? What if one day she\u2019ll come back to punish your \u201cinfidelity\u201d?\n\nTrue, you two were never married and she did tell you to go live your life, but\u2026well she IS a demon and who knows what the hell she\u2019s like now.\n\nYou\u2019re starting to wonder that maybe you weren\u2019t so much bored when you came up with the idea to form the Nocturnal League so much as you were trying to keep your mind occupied on other things. It actually has worked great in that regard, or it did until Vera was about to pursue promotion via cock sucking.\n\n(Well at least taking matters into your own hand is always safe)\n\nIn any case, you put Vera\u2019s inviting mouth out of your mind and refocus on business, which involves going over the ideas that were proposed to you by Vera and Warts in the first place.", "action_results": [{"action": "Expand outside Holgard", "result": "Besides your distaste for slavery, Warts\u2019 plan sounds a lot simpler to implement and you figure Vera won\u2019t be occasionally trying flirt with you for favors (or whatever) if you side with him and hence removing temptation.\n\nVera\u2019s right about someone potentially \u201cgoing rogue\u201d and just fucking off to do their own thing so you\u2019ll have to really lay down the punishment implications to everyone about doing such a thing. Which is exactly what you do. You also tell everyone to not create a bloodbath and if they do, they need to take steps in covering their tracks. Last thing you want is to create too much attention.\n\nWarts is mildly smug about you choosing his plan over Vera who in turn is obviously perturbed. She makes no pretenses about not wanting to be one of those stumbling about in the woods. You reassure her she can focus on her city activities since reassigning her would just cause unnecessary conflict in the long term anyway.\n\nA few months pass and you\u2019re making a fair amount on this venture. You weren\u2019t sure about it at first, but Warts had a good idea.\n\nSurprisingly he has another one.\n\n\u201cHey boss, I got some hobs from da Spider Fangs dat wanna join wit us.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cReally? Thought you told me the Spider Fangs shun human civilization centers.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEh, ever since dey got their asses kicked hard by da elves and lost a good portion of the tribe, there\u2019s been sum serious re-thinkin\u2019 on how things are gonna work now. Anyway, just wunderin\u2019 if they can join.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you had something in mind for them to specifically do?\u201d\n\u201cI figured dey can take part in robbin\u2019 da merchants gig we got going now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I figured that\u2019s what you\u2019d suggest. Probably would be the best use of their skills I imagine. I suppose that would free up some of the folks who still aren\u2019t exactly thrilled about their new assignment. They can come back to the city and the hobs can take their place. Now do I have to talk to these hobs about how I want things done or are you taking care of it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Most of dem are teenagers so be better if I speak to dem. I know what ta say.\u201d\n\nBefore you can say anything else, a small ugly green child wanders in behind Warts. You don\u2019t know how old it is, but it can\u2019t be older than a toddler.\n\n\u201cWargh! blag! Graaah!\u201d it shouts causing Warts to turn around.\n\u201cDamnit, Gubbins! I told ya ta wait in da corridor!\u201d Warts reprimands the child.\n\u201cWarts, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not completely familiar with the growth size of hobgoblins, but I know damn well that\u2019s no teenager.\u201d\n\u201cWut? No! Dis one ain\u2019t robbin\u2019 merchants, well at least not for another few years anyway. Dis iz my son.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re just confused.\n\n\u201cYour son? When the hell did you have a kid?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTwo years ago I guess. Didn\u2019t know for an entire year either since I hadn\u2019t been back ta visit Snuffit in awhile. Boy wuz she pissed at me when I returned. Anyway, he\u2019s sort of with me for awhile since Snuffit says I should be spendin\u2019 time him. She\u2019s probably right. It\u2019s hard growin\u2019 up with no father.\u201d Warts says with a bit of an introspective look down.\n\u201cHm, I suppose you would know about that. You never told me all this about having a family and shit.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d be interested given how youz got yer mind on other things. Got a daughter too, Zuggins. Twins actually. That\u2019s another reason why Snuffit wuz so pissed at me. Hey, didn\u2019t youz say you were a twin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So about these other hobs, you sure they\u2019re going to listen to you? Last time I remember you weren\u2019t accepted as a true hob with the Spider Fangs.\u201d\n\u201cI told ya, things are different now. Most of da assholes I didn\u2019t get along with are dead in dat tribe and it\u2019s takin\u2019 a new look on things as it were. Most of da young hobs I\u2019m suggestin, are orphans now anyway and like I said, I kinda know what it\u2019s like not growin\u2019 up with at least one parent so I think dey gonna\u2026I dunno identify wit me more an\u2019 youz don\u2019t have ta waste yer time.\u201d\n\nYou think about this a few moments.\n\n\u201cAlright, you seem to have come up with one good idea that\u2019s gone over well, so I\u2019m trusting you on this Warts. Go make the preparations.\u201d\n\nWarts nods and leaves with his spawn who sticks his tongue at you.\n\nYou snicker a bit at the thought of Warts having a couple kids, but you suppose he seems happy with them. You\u2019re just glad you aren\u2019t saddled with any; you\u2019ve got enough complications in your life.\n\nThen again with the curse you have, that isn\u2019t likely to ever be a problem.\n\nIn any case when Vera hears about what you\u2019ve allowed she doesn\u2019t do much but shake her head.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing, you\u2019re the boss.\u201d She says.\n\u201cBut obviously you have issues with this.\u201d\n\u201cLook, if you want to hire more hobs on the payroll fine. I can see them being an asset in a menial manner, and working outside Holgard on the road robbery jobs is probably the best place for them mainly because I won\u2019t have to deal with the filthy greenskins.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cBut, my issue is you placing so much fucking trust in Warts. I thought you were smarter than that. Mark my words, that little halfbreed is going to get drunk with power and try to betray you.\u201d\n\u201cWarts? I\u2026mean I\u2019d never rule anything out, but Warts really isn\u2019t the leader type. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s taken on as much responsibility as he has honestly.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well maybe his new family man role is urging the halfbreed to start thinking about his future. Maybe his ugly hob bitch is nagging him to earn more for their equally foul hob spawn.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh Vera, I didn\u2019t know you hated hobs so much.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well they\u2019re a bunch of savages, and I\u2019d watch Warts if I were you. Nothing worse than a mildly intelligent savage with delusions of grandeur.\u201d\n\nWell Vera\u2019s made it quite clear how she feels at any rate.\n\nA few more months pass and so far there haven\u2019t been any issues with your arrangement and business is doing fine. The religious faction war is still going on, but you\u2019re still keeping out of that one.\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s starting to bother you a bit is that Warts has apparently restructured the \u201cbandit parties\u201d outside Holgard without your knowledge. While you replaced some of your less \u201coutdoors\u201d folks with hobs, Warts has been completely segregating the groups so that the hobs are all in one and all the humans are in another.\n\nWhen confronted by this, Warts explains that the hobs just work better together since they all grew up in the same tribe. He also says there\u2019s less potential for infighting during slow periods. He then points to how much success they\u2019ve had with this arrangement.\n\nStill, you\u2019ve got enough to manage and until you see signs of treachery on Warts\u2019 part, you\u2019ll continue to let him handle the outside operations. You\u2019re fairly confident you\u2019ll be savvy enough to realize if something is going wrong and even if you don\u2019t catch it, Vera\u2019s suspicious enough of Warts that she\u2019ll probably tell you.\n\nYear 26\n\n\u201cI told you this was going to happen!\u201d Vera shouts, as she\u2019s running along side you.\n\u201cDamn it! Don\u2019t fucking follow us! Spread out! Spread out! Everyone spread out!\u201d you shout at the various members also running in your direction.\n\nYou never saw this coming. And despite Vera\u2019s comments, she didn\u2019t either, or at least not what she assumed. She was so busy worrying that Warts and the hobs were going to fuck you over that she didn\u2019t take into consideration that their recklessness and stupidity is what drew more attention by the government, though you think you played a large part in that same stupidity by NOT keeping a better eye on things and just leaving it all to Warts.\n\nNow it\u2019s everyone for themselves as you\u2019re stomping through the sewers trying to evade the Holgard Watch who apparently took a step back from keeping the religious factions from destroying small parts of the city, to focus on the assholes who were severely disrupting trade in the city.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rob the odd merchant here and there, but when enough of them were going missing, the Baroness had no choice but to step in. And she stepped hard.\n\nIdeally, you could have separated yourself and just placed all the blame on the hobs and claiming that they weren\u2019t part of the Nocturnal League, but Ludmilla was unfortunately a little smarter than just sending her troops into the woods and had a series of spies (Some of who you think were probably Felians, since you know she had ties to the church at one point).\n\nHobs, never being the subtlest ended up unwittingly showing the Baroness where the hell your secret tunnels to the city were and practically to your front fucking doorstep as they were dragging goods back.\n\nIt\u2019s actually amazing you managed to fight your way out of this surprise attack like you did. Your headquarters is gone though and you can\u2019t imagine that your businesses in the city are going to be around much longer.\n\nEventually you finally evade the law and it\u2019s just you and Vera panting heavily ankle deep in shit water. She immediately starts bitching at you about your bad choices while you\u2019re attempting to figure out your next move.\n\n\u201cWill stop fucking being a massive bitch right now? I know everything\u2019s fucked up! I just need a minute to think for a moment!\u201d you say, trying not to shout and possibly alert attention.\n\n\u201cThink? You should have been doing that before! This is a fucking disaster! Y\u2019know I actually thought you were someone worth following. I even had a little crush on you even though you kept turning me down, but shit, I can see now that you\u2019re a damn jinx at best and a complete fucking idiot at worst and I\u2019m not hanging around you any longer! Have a nice fucking life!\u201d Vera snaps.\n\nAs Vera starts walking away from you, you realize that you have no more organization and no more followers of any kind and oddly that\u2019s what feels more like a loss to you than the massive amount of coin. You were actually stating to just get into your role as an underworld boss and now its over already!\n\nIronically, the only thing you might have left are your people outside of Holgard unless Ludmilla caught up with them too, but given how many of her people came to wipe you out just now, you have to think she focused her forces on the inside of the city rather than the outside. You imagine Warts might be out there somewhere, it\u2019s just a matter of tracking him down.\n\nThen again, Warts and the hobs are what caused this mess in the first place; maybe you need to just start over somewhere else. Still, you don\u2019t want to start completely over. This is a lot easier with help and Vera would still be pretty useful in that regard.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty pissed at you though so you don\u2019t know if that ship has sailed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Convince Vera", "result": "For all her faults, Vera\u2019s your best shot at properly rebuilding a new organization again. You probably should have gone with her plans to get into the slave trade rather than listen to Warts in the first place.\n\nYou run back to Vera and call out to her.\n\n\u201cVera stop. Stop. Let\u2019s talk about this. I apologize for calling you a bitch.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWill you keep your fucking voice down? There are soldiers crawling all over the sewers right now and you\u2019re calling attention to our location! And as I said, I don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve never appreciated my advice, so I don\u2019t see why I should waste anymore time with you.\u201d Vera snaps.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t respond immediately, Vera stops walking and stares at you expectantly.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cBecause\u2026because I really do care about you.\u201d You say suddenly.\n\u201cOh fuck off! You do not! You have gone out of your way several times to make it quite clear that you are NOT interested in me. You\u2019re just telling me this shit so I\u2019ll join you again and now I\u2019m fucking insulted that you think so low of me that I\u2019ll follow you around like some love sick admirer.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true! I really do have feelings for you, I just was too \u2026argh, it\u2019s a long story. Just you gotta believe me on this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do a better job at explaining if you want me to believe you.\u201d\n\nYou realize this is going to take a lot of sweet talk to patch this relationship up and in the back of your mind if you\u2019re successful, you\u2019re still going to have another issue to deal with, but maybe if you explain the curse to her, she\u2019ll be sympathetic.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine. I\u2019ve never told this to anyone before, but for you I\u2019ll do it. Okay, here it is, I\u2019m fucking cursed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about what happened with the League, that was just\u2026bad management on my part though I suppose the curse played a part in my bad decisions.\u201d\n\u201cLook, if you\u2019re cursed, then I REALLY don\u2019t want anything to do with you.\u201d\n\u201cWill you listen?! You asked me to explain, so I\u2019m trying to! It\u2019s not that sort of curse anyway. It\u2019s on my dick and that\u2019s why I kept pushing you away.\u201d\n\nVera steps back from you.\n\n\u201cWhat you got crotch rot?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cI wish it was that simple. No, what I got is\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly you hear a loud blast and feel the piercing of a metal object hitting you in the back. You fall down in the filthy water and struggle to breathe, let alone get back up.\n\nThe shouting of several watchmen is heard followed by Vera shouting back and returning fire. She attempts to pull you up, but the bullet has shattered your spine and you\u2019re not going anywhere\n\n\u201cGo\u2026just go\u2026\u201d you utter as she gives you a frustrated look mixed with sadness before running off.\n\nDying face down in shit water is one of the less dignified ways to go out, but you don\u2019t dwell on it to much before one of Holgard\u2019s finest puts you down for good with a bullet to your head.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Find Warts", "result": "Vera\u2019s made her point clear and quite frankly you don\u2019t really think its worth it to convince her if she\u2019s got that much bad feelings toward you.

You think about going to your private stash you have buried, but decide if you really need monetary incentive to convince anyone to still follow you, then it probably won\u2019t be worth it or you can do it as a last resort.\n\nYou try to go to the last known places where your people had camps, but you have to spend most of your time avoiding the Holgard Watch who are patrolling the nearby area a lot more.\n\nAfter having to kill a few of them, you find remnants of one of the League\u2019s camps which display signs of battle what with the bloody bodies of your people lying around. It\u2019s apparent that the Watch isn\u2019t bothering to take prisoners.\n\nDoesn\u2019t look like they took out the League hob camp though since you don\u2019t find them among the dead (you do find some of the Watch dead though). Given that they\u2019re probably a lot more experienced outdoors they probably retreated further into the forest. While you\u2019re not exactly some wilderness tracker, hobs aren\u2019t exactly the cleanest and tend to leave trash around. You begin to follow the trail as best you can.\n\nYou continue your search, but it\u2019s been awhile since you\u2019ve been stomping about in the wilderness and it\u2019s soon apparent that you\u2019re not exactly prepared since you get turned around several times.\n\nYou spend the next few days in the forest getting yourself more lost despite the fact that you thought you were logically following a trail. You imagine they headed to Spiderfang territory but its not like you even know if you\u2019re close to there or not.\n\nYou\u2019re tired, dirty, hungry, thirsty and just all around miserable. Eventually you decide to just give up and try to make your way back. You THINK you might know how to get back to the main road and from there you\u2019re going to go back to dig up your stash and make your way elsewhere entirely because this has been a complete disaster. You\u2019re starting to wonder if you should have just tried to convince Vera to join you.\n\nIn your haste to try to get your bearings, you\u2019re slightly less observant of the little things and unfortunately for you that results in worse than just being lost.\n\nYou step into a pit trap and fall directly onto several sharpened branches. The pain is excruciating since you weren\u2019t lucky enough for the wooden spikes to kill you right away. You howl out in agony for hours, but nobody comes.\n\nEventually the blood loss and organ damage takes enough of a toll on you that you begin to lose consciousness. You\u2019re dying and at this point you don\u2019t even care anymore.\n\nYour last thoughts are how it\u2019s an ignoble death to die like some animal out in the middle of the woods, but it\u2019s a lot better than continuing to be in pain. You wish you had done a lot of things differently in your life, but it\u2019s too late for that now.\n\nA day later your body is found by some hobs who were in the League and Warts soon learns of your demise when they bring your body to the hobgoblin village for food where he and the rest retreated to.

If anything engaging in more banditry on the roads to Holgard might cause the government to increase security so trade isn\u2019t hampered.\n\nBetter you should stick to things that won\u2019t directly fuck with the government too much directly and Vera already has experience in the whole slave market thing so you\u2019re confident she\u2019ll know how to run it properly.\n\nThe only thing you do have concerns about is\u2026well the whole slavery thing. You don\u2019t profess to be a saint of Joachim, but this seems a bit too far even for you. You aren\u2019t even sure where you\u2019re going to be getting these slaves from in the first place.\n\nSince she\u2019s the expert, you decide to have another discussion with Vera about all this before making a final decision, but not right now. You figure after what happened you probably should wait a bit before seeing her again.\n\nThe next day you meet with her in your office again and she seems surprised that you\u2019re entertaining her idea.\n\n\u201cWow, I just thought after yesterday, you weren\u2019t interested. Well this is great, you\u2019ll see!\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m still going to need convincing if this is something we need to get into. So you\u2019ll need to persuade me why this is worth pursuing AND I don\u2019t mean with your body.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well. What did you have concerns with exactly?\u201d\n\u201cWarts mentioned that keeping captives costs coin. I mean how much are we going to be spending to keep them before selling them?\u201d\n\u201cOh, not that much. Really all you have to do is provide the bare minimum most of the time.\u201d\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t that sort of decrease the quality?\u201d\n\u201cYes if enough time passes, but that\u2019s why you try to sell as quickly as possible. Obviously women typically sell for a lot more than men and they sell faster.\u201d\n\u201cSo where are we getting these slaves anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWell back when I was working for Elias, we usually nabbed people off the street. Get \u2018em drunk at a tavern. Trick \u2018em into a dark alley. Y\u2019know like robbing someone except instead of taking just their money, you take them too. Sometimes we bought them off of Hessla pirates and sold them for a higher profit to someone else. I\u2019ll have to get re-connect with my Hessla contacts before we can do that though.\u201d\n\nYou look down a bit and frown.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cI dunno, maybe this is just not something I feel comfortable with.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute. You\u2019ve got a moral quandary about THIS too? If I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d start thinking I had joined Joachim\u2019s church!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I told you that YOU needed to convince me. So convince me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay so what are you having a problem with exactly? Wait, let me guess. It\u2019s the whole sex thing isn\u2019t it? Geez, you got some weird hang ups about sex.\u201d\n\u201cWell that IS what these women are going to be sold for right?\u201d\n\u201cHow is that different than the brothels we run?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big fucking difference! For one, the whores at least have a say in things.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it make a difference that some of the guys are probably used for fuck holes too?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then would it make a difference if ALL the slaves were just being used to go get worked to death in some iron mine?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026at least I\u2019d feel like we were at least contributing to the economy in some way as opposed to just feeling like we\u2019re running one big rape factory.\u201d\n\u201cOh and I suppose our protection rackets and our Purple Wish dens are great contributions to society as well.\u201d\n\u201cCall it my own twisted sense of honor, but at least our extortion of businesses isn\u2019t completely one sided. I mean we ARE offering protection. Also we\u2019re not shoving Purple Wish down anyone\u2019s throat. If people want to get high, we\u2019re providing a product. If people want to be idiots and get addicted well that\u2019s on them. Our gambling places work the same way. Nobody is forcing anyone to go into debt.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, maybe not, but I still think we should re-open a slave market. Sex slaves are just too profitable to not get into.\u201d\n\u201cWell wait a minute. What about fighting slaves? Y\u2019know slaves that fight each other and people bet on who wins.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean like for underground gladiator matches? Eh\u2026yeah we bought a few of pit slaves once and it didn\u2019t go so well. You want to talk about upkeep, those bastards need upkeep because you need to keep them in good condition for a potential buyer. Not to mention on almost every occasion they tried to escape or kill one of us. One of them actually succeeded in killing four people under Elias before being subdued. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it and I find it funny that you\u2019re perfectly okay with that brand of slavery as opposed to the sexual kind. You really are a prude aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I am, but I\u2019m also still not entirely convinced of the upkeep costs being low. I mean if we\u2019re going to go into this, I would prefer our slaves to be known as being good quality and not half starving and dirty.\u201d\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re worried about that, we could always stick to children.\u201d\n\u201cChildren?!\u201d\n\u201cSure! We used to sell more than a few back in the old days and they\u2019re really low upkeep and easy to nab as well.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re done.\n\n\u201cNo. We are NOT capturing and selling fucking kids! THAT is where I\u2019m drawing the damn line. In fact I\u2019m thinking this whole thing is a bad idea.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo\u2026what then? You\u2019re going to go with Wart\u2019s idea?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s retarded for different reasons. I\u2019m going with my own idea. We\u2019re going to hold underground gladiator matches.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said we weren\u2019t getting into slaves.\u201d\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t, this will all be voluntary. Plenty of stupid assholes that are willing to try to prove they\u2019re tough for a bit of coin. If they get themselves killed, well that\u2019s on them and either way, we don\u2019t need to worry about keeping anyone in good condition, unless we\u2019re fixing a particular fight. Hell, we could also use people that are falling behind in their debts to participate rather than breaking their legs. So no slaves needed.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, if we\u2019re pressing potential deadbeats into fights, that\u2019s sort of like enslaving them isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe it is, but at least we\u2019re just trying to make our money back from said deadbeat as opposed to snatching some hapless girl off the streets.\u201d\n\u201cWell we could always apply this to our brothel whores too. I mean if a whore doesn\u2019t make enough money for the month then she gets her ass thrown into slavery for slacking off.\u201d\n\nYou never knew that Vera is REALLY into this whole slave trade business. Though you suppose given that she worked as one for so long, it makes sense she wants to stick with it. You\u2019re not going to hold it against her, but you\u2019ve definitely realized that you\u2019ve still got some scruples, scant though they may be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not peddling sex slaves of any kind, Vera. That\u2019s it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re in the right business, boss?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cI could always cut your head off and let you decide.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, no need for threats, I know you\u2019re a badass. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m finding out that you\u2019re strangely principled in ways that I\u2019m not used to in our line of work. I guess maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Shows you aren\u2019t some complete psycho I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t jump to that conclusion, but at least you can take comfort in the fact that IF you ever fail me, I\u2019m not going to have you stripped naked and sell your ass to pirates.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s one less thing to worry about at least.\u201d\n\nAfter going over some more details, you tell Vera to gather up a crew and start setting things up. It isn\u2019t what she exactly envisioned she\u2019d be doing, but then she\u2019s not running things.\n\nA few months pass and you\u2019re making a good amount of coin with this new venture and you can take a little relief that there\u2019s still some things you aren\u2019t going to do even in your position\u2026\n\n\u201cHey boss, I got some hobs from da Spider Fangs dat wanna join the fights tonight.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cReally? Thought you told me the Spider Fangs shun human civilization centers.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEh, ever since dey got their asses kicked hard by da elves and lost a good portion of the tribe, there\u2019s been sum serious re-thinkin\u2019 on how things are gonna work now. Anyway, just wunderin\u2019 if they can join.\u201d\n\u201cWell sure, we always got room. In fact why are you coming to me about it, and not Vera anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWell I did, an\u2019 she told me to come ta youz cuz youz might object to sum of dem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would I object to, I\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\u201cNah, not dat. It\u2019s just a few of dem are young teenagers and Vera said youz might have a problem with dat.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nBefore you can give a more thorough answer a small ugly green child wanders in behind Warts. You don\u2019t know how old it is, but it can\u2019t be older than a toddler.\n\n\u201cWargh! blag! Graaah!\u201d it shouts causing Warts to turn around.\n\u201cDamnit, Gubbins! I told ya ta wait in da corridor!\u201d Warts reprimands the child.\n\u201cWarts, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not completely familiar with the growth size of hobgoblins, but I know damn well that\u2019s no teenager.\u201d\n\u201cWut? No! Dis one ain\u2019t fightin\u2019, well at least not for another few years anyway. Dis iz my son.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re just confused.\n\n\u201cYour son? When the hell did you have a kid?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTwo years ago I guess. Didn\u2019t know for an entire year either since I hadn\u2019t been back ta visit Snuffit in awhile. Boy wuz she pissed at me when I returned. Anyway, he\u2019s sort of with me for awhile since Snuffit says I should be spendin\u2019 time him. She\u2019s probably right. It\u2019s hard growin\u2019 up with no father.\u201d Warts says with a bit of an introspective look down.\n\u201cHm, I suppose you would know about that. You never told me all this about having a family and shit.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d be interested given how youz got yer mind on other things. Got a daughter too, Zuggins. Twins actually. That\u2019s another reason why Snuffit wuz so pissed at me. Hey, didn\u2019t youz say you were a twin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So about these other hobs\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah, they\u2019re fighting age to be sure. An\u2019 remember these are hobgoblin children that have been livin\u2019 in da wild all their lives. I guarantee they\u2019ve all probably killed already.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. Do their parents know about this?\u201d\n\u201cI think most of dem are orphans due to the feud with da elves an\u2019 they\u2019re here to either start a new life or tryin\u2019 ta make some coin for da tribe.\u201d\n\nYou think about this a few moments and then throw up your hands.\n\n\u201cFuck it, if they wanna fight. Not gonna stop them. Anyway, go talk to Vera about the match details of who to pair them up against.\u201d Actually you should get her to set them up with an elven opponent if possible. Should incite a little more bloodthirst.\u201d\n\nWarts nods and leaves with his spawn who sticks his tongue at you.\n\nYou snicker a bit at the thought of Warts having a couple kids, but you suppose he seems happy with them. You\u2019re just glad you aren\u2019t saddled with any; you\u2019ve got enough complications in your life.\n\nThen again with the curse you have, that isn\u2019t likely to ever be a problem.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 27\n\nWhile conflict can be good for business, there sometimes is a point when it starts becoming a hindrance. Especially when the wrong side is winning.\n\n\u201cThe Joachimites are starting to break this stalemate and win this religious war you know. The Yagites are gone and so are the followers of Karn. The Dornans are still around, but they\u2019ve decided to just put up a force field around their temple and ride it all out. That just leaves the Temple of Fel and rumors are that they expended a lot of their power taking down the Karnites.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cDey ain\u2019t gonna last long against dem purity fanatics. They\u2019re worse than those Neroth cultists were and there is a lot more of dem.\u201d Warts adds.\n\u201cYeah, an\u2019 more people are starting to join. Maybe not in their fighting ranks, but that isn\u2019t our problem. What IS our problem is these folks are the same ones preaching for purity and living a clean life to everyone. We\u2019re going to start having serious complications if they win and have complete influence over the city as the only religion.\u201d\n\nThe concerns that Vera and Warts both bring up aren\u2019t lost on you, in fact you\u2019ve been having them yourself. You\u2019ve already been seeing a drop in profit in most of your business ventures.\n\nYou were hoping to avoid getting involved and you certainly didn\u2019t anticipate the Joachimites being so violently fanatical as they\u2019ve been. Then again nobody really did.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t understand is why the hell they\u2019ve even been allowed to get this far. There was always the rumor that Baroness Varsakken herself was a worshipper of Fel so you would have thought she might have intervened in some direct way. But maybe it was just rumors.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but wonder if the Ebony Claw Syndicate was still around if the Temple of Fel would be doing much better than they are. It might be a case that you\u2019re going to have to be the ones to help instead.\n\nYou\u2019re not exactly on friendly terms with the Felians, but you\u2019ve never really had any problems with them either. Your issues with them are just like you have with any religion and that\u2019s that you find them to be too restrictive. Honestly, if you had it to do over again, you might have sided with the Yagites since they seemed the least fanatical, though even Warts didn\u2019t think much of them claiming that people shouldn\u2019t organize to worship Yag in the first place.\n\nIn any case, you aren\u2019t even sure if the Felians will be receptive to an alliance or what it might even entail. You have to try though because you can\u2019t afford to just sit by and do nothing anymore.\n\n\u201cGuess I need to have a meeting with whoever is the head of the Temple of Fel. Do we have any actual information on that?\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cUm, not really boss. You know the Felians, they\u2019re a pretty secretive bunch. In fact, don\u2019t even know where they\u2019re all holding out at actually now ever since their temple was directly attacked and partially destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cMm, well put the word out that I want to talk with the high priest or whoever. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get back to them eventually.\u201d\n\nYour orders are carried out and life continues as usual for you. Weeks pass and for a while you think you\u2019re probably not going to get an answer. In fact you start to wonder if the Joachimites already succeeded in wiping them all out.\n\nHowever, one night when you\u2019re in bed you awaken and sit up with your pistol drawn from under your pillow.\n\nA dark figure that you can barely make out sits in the corner of the room.\n\n\u201cNot sure why you\u2019re bothering with that thing. I could have killed you several times over already and that\u2019s even before you actually woke up. My name is Shade.\u201d The figure says.\n\u201cAppropriate name. Was wondering when one of you lot would show up.\u201d You say, lowering your weapon.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been a little pre-occupied as of late. Defending the faith of Fel is a tireless cause, but one we take very seriously.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose its even more tiring when you\u2019re on the losing side.\u201d\n\u201cIt may appear that way to the ignorant faithless, but I assure you that is not the case. We are merely biding our time and will strike when the time is right.\u201d\n\u201cSure you are. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re here wondering what I might have to say to help quicken that wait time.\u201d\n\u201cYou presume much for a petty criminal.\u201d\n\u201cPet\u2026okay, you know what. I\u2019m sick of this. We can sit here all night and verbally kick each other in the balls, but the point is, I wanted to speak with you about a mutual enemy, which are those fanatical Joachimites. Now they haven\u2019t been a direct threat to me and mine yet, but I imagine when they finally are through with you, we\u2019ll be next in their purity crusade. Since I\u2019d rather not have to deal with them by myself, I reached out to you for a possible alliance. I figured since you once had a similar set up with the Ebony Claw Syndicate, you wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the idea.\u201d\n\nYou hear a snort of laughter when you mention the ECS.\n\n\u201cSomething funny?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, irony is always funny.\u201d Shade says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cNot everyone was keen on our alliance with the Syndicate. In fact I was very vocal against our alliance with them. I felt it sullied our faith to associate with such criminals. Allowing some of them into our shadow magic secrets. It was a disgrace to Fel\u2019s name. Joachimite\u2019s foolishly believe they have the cornerstone on the concept of purity. Let me tell you, purity isn\u2019t only found in the so called light.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can see that you have some strong feelings on all this.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right I do. Which is why I didn\u2019t kill you immediately even though I could tell you had your own agenda against the Ebony Claw Syndicate the first time I met you. Now here I am dealing with you again despite our temple\u2019s break from alliances with the unworthy.\u201d\n\nYou pause and realize who you\u2019re talking to exactly. You remember at the time after everything that happened with the ECS you wondered if you\u2019d have to deal with this man again. You never thought it would be in this capacity though.\n\n\u201cSo, you were sent by the Fel leadership to deal with yet another criminal group. Yeah, I can see where that would piss you off.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s even worse since I AM the Temple\u2019s leadership this time. Shortly after the ECS started to collapse with the death of their boss which I have no doubt you had a hand in, there was another debate on whether or not help. It was then when I decided that our temple should seize the chance to discard our alliance and go back to basics. Let\u2019s just say the disagreement with the leadership at the time got heated and I took our temple back to what it should be focusing on.\u201d Shade says.\n\u201cAnd it looks like that worked out real well for you.\u201d\n\u201cIt did. At least for a time. In any case, all of my actions would seem to have been for naught since I\u2019m here. While perhaps I believe outside influences are a corrupting influence on our faith, I must also be pragmatic if our faith is to survive in this city.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how you lot let yourselves get in this position in the first place. I mean you fuckers sneak about silently, turn invisible, and are one with the shadows. I mean arguably that\u2019s why the Ebony Claw was so feared in the first place, due to your alliance along with its top leaders being practitioners of Shadow magic, and I imagine they couldn\u2019t even do everything your top followers could. What about other Fel temples elsewhere? You can\u2019t just call on help from them? Not to mention I thought you lot even had government influence. I mean I always heard the rumor that Baroness Ludmilla was a follower of Fel.\u201d\n\u201cWell the part of that is easy to answer, because it relates back to my break away from outside influence. You see, the next closest chapter, which exists in the Delantium Kingdom where they still maintain close ties to the ECS, doesn\u2019t exactly approve of THIS particular chapter. Hence I can expect no help from them. As for the Baroness, well let\u2019s just say she\u2019s a politician first and even more of a dabbler than a typical ECS lieutenant. It probably doesn\u2019t help that I cut most ties with her on our temple other than bare minimum cordial tolerance for her superficial intrigue on our faith.\u201d\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so much of a fanatic, you might have had a few more friends to help you now.\u201d\n\u201cI remind you, that if I hadn\u2019t been so much of a fanatic, I would have killed you a long time ago. However, you are right of course unfortunately. Lately I\u2019ve been wondering if all of this that has happened is Fel\u2019s way of punishing me for my hubris and past transgressions. I suppose it is equally amusing that my own rigid fanaticism caused my temple\u2019s downfall, while that same rigid fanaticism is causing the Joachimites\u2019 churches resurgence. Their god has been blessing them not just in the martial ways, but of magic as well. Our own shadow magic is practically rendered useless when faced with their light magic. Can\u2019t even get anyone close enough to stealthily assassinate their known top priests. Let alone the one who\u2019s actually leading them.\u201d\n\u201cWho is leading them anyway? I mean we\u2019ve only got a few rumors and names.\u201d\n\u201cA bit of an enigma. So much so, it would actually make Fel proud. All we know is they call themselves The Inquisitor.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same name I\u2019ve heard a few times.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and that\u2019s about all that\u2019s known about him, assuming it\u2019s a guy. Have no real clue since whenever there have been sightings of the Inquisitor; the person is wearing a white mask along with a long white robe. Could be anything under there.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t assassinate him?\u201d\n\u201cBesides the fact that he moves around a lot, we\u2019ve tried several times and we can\u2019t get close enough. He\u2019s also got some sort of magical protection that deflects projectiles of any kind. I suppose if we had more people maybe we could try to overwhelm him, but those damn Joachimites\u2026they do not go down easy. Some of them rival a Karnite priest in their stubbornness to die and I should know because I\u2019ve had to fight several of each. Yes, they are definitely not the peace and love pacifists they once were. I guess perhaps the Neroth cultists that were plaguing the city years ago lit that spark of hate back in them.\u201d\n\nWhile all this is mildly fascinating, you think it\u2019s time to get to business.\n\n\u201cShit, I was hoping this might be easier if we aligned. The way you\u2019re talking you make it sound like this Inquisitor is nigh invulnerable.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not invulnerable. Peel away all that protection and I\u2019m sure he bleeds like everyone else. It\u2019s just getting through it, that\u2019s all. As much as I\u2019m loathed to admit, your help WOULD probably go a long way in the Joachimites\u2019 eventual defeat. For one thing they aren\u2019t expecting an attack from your group. Set it up right and you could probably do a lot of damage with your first attack. Be prepared for the retaliation though, because it will be fierce. Hope you\u2019re ready to take some personnel losses.\u201d Shade says.\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned by financial losses, but better to take a big loss now than a complete loss later if we don\u2019t help at all. Just wish there was another way rather than the slog that\u2019s going to ensue. If we could take out this Inquisitor leader immediately, I would imagine the rest might lose some of their fight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. Remember, all of these people are motivated by their love and faith of Joachim, not this Inquisitor. He\u2019s just leading the charge. However, you may have a point in that if he was out of the picture quicker, then perhaps those of lesser conviction may indeed be shaken enough to no longer be a concern. While our attempts at breaking through the Inquisitor\u2019s magic defenses have failed, I can think of one group who might be able to and that\u2019s the Dornans.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I take it you\u2019re not on good terms with them either.\u201d\n\u201cNo, however you are a neutral party and if you\u2019re willing, you might be able to talk with them. Of course there\u2019s a bit of a danger though. The Dornans as you might know have taken a cocoon like approach to this whole event with their protective barrier around their own temple. Only Holgard Watchmen who patrol through the area at times are allowed anywhere near the place. The Joachimites attempted an attack on it once and they were incinerated almost instantly. Even they haven\u2019t dared to do it again.\u201d\n\u201cSo if I go to talk with them, at best they\u2019ll probably ignore me, at worst they\u2019ll turn me into ash.\u201d\n\u201cEssentially, yes. Up to you though if you want to take that risk. If you do and assuming you\u2019re successful, I believe on my end we can track down the latest where abouts of the Inquisitor and hit him hard. This brings me to my question to you. Regardless of what approach we go with, what exactly is it that you want of the Temple of Fel in exchange for your assistance in this matter?\u201d\n\u201cOh that. Well I haven\u2019t made up my mind on that exactly yet. Don\u2019t worry though, I have no intention on insisting that you teach me or any Nocturnal League members shadow magic or otherwise intertwine our two organizations. All I ask for is if there comes a day where I need a really need a big favor, I expect you to honor it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHow big exactly?\u201d Shade asks.\n\u201cOh not bigger than saving an entire organization from extinction I assure you. In any case, I know you\u2019re obviously a man of great faith so I expect you to make this promise to Fel that you will help me whenever that day comes. Do this and I will take your word as true.\u201d\n\nYou hear nothing for a moment followed by a loud sigh. This has to be killing Shade, but better his pride dies tonight than the meager remains of his temple.\n\n\u201cVery well. Assuming you succeed in helping us, I swear by the purity of the shadows provided by Fel that give us protection against our enemies that I will help you when you call upon it in the future and extend that protection to you. Now, do you have an idea of which way you want to go with the attack?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "War of attrition", "result": "While there may be more Joachimites than Felians, you know there aren\u2019t more of them than the Nocturnal League. It\u2019ll just be a matter of keeping up the pressure and whittling them down. Eventually there won\u2019t be enough of them to defend this Inquisitor properly and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll make the killing strike.\n\nWhen you explain this to Shade however, he\u2019s less than enthusiastic about your rather laid back plan.\n\n\u201cHonestly I had hoped you had a better idea than just simply trying to wear them down.\u201d Shade remarks.\n\u201cWell all your attempts at going in for the kill immediately have failed so maybe a new approach is what is needed.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, my organization is fighting for its survival and we don\u2019t have time to sit on our hands and wait for the enemy to overwhelm us!\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t now, you\u2019ve got our help. With our forces together the Joachimites will eventually crumble. I don\u2019t care who this Inquisitor asshole is, he won\u2019t be shit after all his buddies start dying.\u201d\n\nShade doesn\u2019t look convinced, but he reluctantly agrees with your plan.\n\nYou don\u2019t wait too long before you put your plan into action. Also doesn\u2019t take long before the Joachimites are on the defensive. Your first few attacks are particularly devastating to their ranks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t without cost however. As time goes on, the Joachimites manage to drum up more support in the form of their non-combative followers. All those regular Joachim fearing Holgard citizens that weren\u2019t directly involved are now becoming more of a problem as several start openly standing up to Nocturnal League members in the streets preaching about how the League is a blight on this godless city and divine justice will soon be upon you. This never goes well for them of course, but it\u2019s not doing wonders for you either.\n\nWith so many standing up to the League, it\u2019s harder to maintain the natural fear you were instilling in the population. Relying on more brutal methods to keep people in check works, but unfortunately you can\u2019t collect money from the dead and the violence from your organization is getting so bad that even the normally corrupt Holgard Watch has to step in to maintain some semblance of order and you begin to lose business.\n\nIn fact it gets to a point where the Baroness demands that ALL hostilities between the religious factions come to a halt or she\u2019ll be sending in soldiers to deal with everyone involved. This goes about as well as you might expect.\n\nThe Inquisitor, still as zealous as ever makes a rare public appearance calling for a holy crusade on the city itself and that anyone who truly believes in Joachim\u2019s light, should follow or be cast down into darkness like the rest of the infidels.\n\nIt is during this speech that the Felians, attempt to launch one more direct attack upon him. Shade himself even leads the charge. You would have helped had you known about it, but coordinated efforts between you and Shade haven\u2019t been the best since you agreed to join him in the first place.\n\nYou weren\u2019t there to witness it first hand, but the assassination attempt is a failure. Shade is even killed in the process, brought down by some sort of divine light that utterly melted him. The sight was so impressive that anyone who was on the fence about joining the Joachimites became a believer that day.\n\nWith the Felians broken, any of them alive after that point flee their temple and the city itself. Which ultimately leaves you and the Baroness to combat this religious mad man. (The Dornans continue to remain fiercely neutral and refuse to see anyone, remaining behind a magical barrier around their temple.\n\nThe Nocturnal League isn\u2019t out of the fight, but many of the members are seriously starting to question your leadership since nobody is making as much coin with religious fanaticism taking root and your businesses no longer being the draw they used to. A couple foolishly attempt to challenge you (which results in their death) but more of them are just thinking about leaving the city for better pickings. Warts ends up being one of those since he just disappears one day and doesn\u2019t return. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s dead, but you remember he did this before during the last major Holgard conflict. Vera\u2019s pissed and you are too to a small degree, but you aren\u2019t excessively surprised.\n\nYou continue your fight with the Joachimites and fortunately get a little relief from the government since Ludmilla finally calls a halt to ongoing hostilities towards the League since the Joachimites are a greater threat. However your activities are severely limited to just running brothels and gambling. Other activities such as extortion or dealing drugs are to no longer be tolerated. You don\u2019t have much choice in the matter since much like the government; you can\u2019t fight a war on two fronts and are just managing to keep the League from collapsing internally.\n\nAfter a few months, you maintain a more defensive posture and focus on consolidation of your own forces while Ludmilla spares no expensive in stomping out the Joachimite religion in the city. Eventually enough oppressive laws along with Ludmilla somehow coming to a deal with the Dornans to provide minor assistance the Inquisitor\u2019s last holdout with his most fanatical followers are tracked down and defeated.\n\nAll religion save for the temple of Dorna are outlawed and anyone holding Joachimite beliefs is sentenced to death, putting a final end to the religious faction war in the city once and for all.\n\nAs for you and the League, it\u2019s been a war of attrition indeed and you curse the fact that you allowed yourself to get wrapped up in this in the first place, but then again who knows if this wouldn\u2019t have happened eventually anyway and at least the Joachimites will no longer plague the city.\n\nYou\u2019re in a much weaker position now, but you imagine that you can hopefully bounce back from it. You just need time.\n\nYear 28\n\n\u201cMaybe the halfbreed really is dead if he hasn\u2019t returned yet. I certainly hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cPossibly, but it\u2019s only been a year and things still aren\u2019t really settled yet in this city. He\u2019s probably just waiting it all out a little longer. In any case, what was it that you wanted to suggest?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI was going to suggest that maybe it\u2019s time we start looking to better opportunities because Holgard in its current state isn\u2019t getting any better for us. That baroness bitch has become miss law and order all of a sudden and she\u2019s even employing more magic in this task now thanks to her new alliance with the Dornans!\u201d\n\u201cWell last I heard Klyton isn\u2019t exactly that great for rogues like us and Hessla is a piss poor pirate town. The Delantium Kingdom is Ebony Claw territory, so that doesn\u2019t give many options to expand.\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking of Jicol.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cJicol is a port city on an island west of Hessla. They\u2019ve got a large enough navy to fend off pirates, but as far as I know, they don\u2019t really focus on their land based security as much.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\n\u201cI got some pirate contacts who tell me shit from time to time. Honestly, I\u2019m thinking we should just take the whole operation there, but I\u2019m guessing you might be a little reluctant to just leave Holgard entirely.\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but I\u2019ve always trusted your judgement and you\u2019ve stuck with this organization through some rough times, so if this Jicol is open like you\u2019re claiming, then maybe we should check it out. I guess I\u2019d send you with some people to get started.\u201d\n\nVera smiles a bit when you approve of her idea so quickly. You try not to think about it too much, but you\u2019re pretty certain that Vera is genuinely attracted to you and not just on a physical or \u201ccareer\u201d level. You don\u2019t really want to ever think about it due to the whole fact that you\u2019re cursed. Something you haven\u2019t really had time to think about too much, but you need to fix it someday if you ever want to have any sort of relationship again. Maybe you could try to go see the Dornans about getting it lifted or something.\n\nIn the meantime, Vera also springs some extra news on you that you weren\u2019t expecting.\n\n\u201cOh, some man with a shaved head and several burn scars on his face and hands was asking about you by name at one of our brothels. He said he knew you from the old days.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cOh? Wait, this wasn\u2019t an older guy was it?\u201d you ask, suddenly wondering if it was Sneaks. (You never did learn what happened to him)\n\u201cNo, this guy said his name was Yinen. Said he used to do some business with you\u2026name sounds familiar.\u201d\n\u201cYinen? Yeah I know him! He was a fence for the Thieves Guild. Well for the Syndicate too really, maybe that\u2019s why the name sounds familar, but in any case the last time I saw him was when I rescued him from a Neroth torture cell. Never did know what happened to him either, where the hell has he been?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, this is second hand info I got from some of our people. All I know is he wants to speak with you about settling some debts.\u201d\n\u201cDebts? The only one I can think of between us is him repaying me for saving his life.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe that\u2019s what he wants to do. Here.\u201d Vera gives you a small piece of parchment with some writing on it. \u201cHe gave this to our people and this apparently is an address of where he\u2019s currently staying at and said you can meet him there at anytime. You want me to just have some people bring him here though?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I can make the trip down there. He\u2019s not Nocturnal League anyway, so he doesn\u2019t need to know our hideout. Though who knows, maybe we\u2019ll have a new member. Could use the help right about now. Anyway, why don\u2019t you start making the arrangements for your trip to Jicol.\u201d\n\nAs Vera sets out to follow your orders, you decide to go visit Yinen now while you\u2019ve got the time. You\u2019re sort of wondering what Yinen\u2019s meeting is all about. Last time you saw him, it wasn\u2019t under the best circumstances and he was ranting like a madman after his torture by the Neroth cult. Hopefully he\u2019s gotten over all that.\n\nYou soon arrive at a run down house in a lower class district. The house itself looks like it suffered through the recent conflicts in the city. Wouldn\u2019t be the only property in this city to do so.\n\nYou knock on the door and soon it opens and that\u2019s when you see Yinen.\n\n\u201cYinen? What the hell happened to you?\u201d you say remarking about several things applying to him.\n\u201cHello old comrade, as for what happened to me, that\u2019s a long story. First though, come on in and let me say I want to apologize for attacking you that day you saved me from that wretched cell.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was a long time ago\u2026but I don\u2019t remember the Nerothians burning you. Where did you get all these burn marks on your hands and face?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s an even longer story and I\u2019ll tell you about that too, but rest assured, what you see on my hands and face is just a fraction of what is practically all over. Doesn\u2019t matter though, I healed and grew stronger. I had far greater losses than any superficial physical appearance.\u201d\n\nYou step inside and Yinen closes the door before walking into a humble living area.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse the mess and disrepair of this place. Used to be my parents until they died.\u201d Yinen says.\n\u201cOh. Didn\u2019t know your parents lived here.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWhy would you? I tended to keep my old business life as private as possible. They were good Joachim fearing folks that didn\u2019t have much to do with me anyway. Of course that\u2019s also what got them killed. Ludmilla didn\u2019t show much mercy to any of those faithful to Joachim and my parents while peaceful would never willingly give up their faith. You can guess what happened.\u201d\n\u201cYeeah\u2026I imagine that would suck. So they died during that conflict?\u201d\n\u201cYes, last year towards the end of it, before the Inquisitor was finally brought down by Ludmilla\u2019s troops. I only heard about my parents a few months after everything had died down. I was a little pre-occupied with something else at the time, but I rushed back here to this accursed city as soon as possible to take care of various affairs.\u201d\n\nYinen at this point goes over to a small box and pulls a couple ornamental objects out of it. They look like symbols dedicated to Joachim.\n\n\u201cCareful with those, you get caught with them and it\u2019s the death penalty rather than just a fine and jail time. Sort of surprised those objects weren\u2019t destroyed when your parents were\u2026killed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh these didn\u2019t belong to them. These are mine. This house was either filled with broken furniture or garbage until I moved in. Apparently the government didn\u2019t bother repurposing it or even seizing the property for housing someone else. Just left abandoned.\u201d Yinen says.\n\u201cYour stuff and you snuck it in here? Are you crazy?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose to many I am. I have even questioned my own sanity at times, but then I remember, Joachim has given me his guidance and holy mission. And no matter what, I will not fail in that mission. I have learned from my failures and will follow a new path to bring his divine justice.\u201d\n\nAt this point Yinen\u2019s voice sounds more fanatical even if it remains calm and you get a very uneasy feeling. So uneasy in fact that you go for your weapon.\n\nYinen turns around and before you know it, your pistol burns so hot in your hand that you drop it. You go for your blade, but once again you burn your hand.\n\n\u201cJoachim\u2019s will cannot be stopped and this city WILL learn this. I regret that I must destroy you who once saved my life. Indeed if not for you, I would not be on my holy path that I am today. For that I thank you, but you are one of the many symptoms of wickedness in this city. Perhaps if you had not attacked my flock so brutally a parley might have been possible, but then I should know that one cannot suffer a sinner. One can only cleanse them.\u201d Yinen says raising his hands, which are emanating a white glowing light.\n\u201cShit\u2026it was you. You were the\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhen the baroness\u2019 men tried to kill me by setting my last church on fire and barricading me inside, they should have known that fire only purifies and will never kill those on the right path or those whose work is not yet done. All that happened in my near death experience was my focus became even clearer with the will of Joachim. I give you the only mercy I can to an infidel. I give you a quick death and may Joachim forgive you.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to run out the door, but before you even reach it, your whole body spontaneously combusts into flames. You scream in agony as the fire completely engulfs your body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decisive Strike", "result": "If you have a chance to take down the Joachimites in an expedient manner then you\u2019re going to take it. Last thing you want is this to drag out any longer than you have to.\n\nYou tell Shade that you\u2019re going to try to meet with the Dornans. Shade sounds a bit surprised when you tell him but agrees that it is worth a try along with saying that they probably won\u2019t kill you just for asking for an audience. (You sure hope he\u2019s right.)\n\nHe goes on to tell you that their high priest is Elder Flynn and he tends to be a bit aloof and always involved in some magic experiment so you might not even get to speak to him directly as he prefers to let one of his subordinates take care of things. Shade also mentions if you\u2019ve got anything magical laying around, that might help you get a meeting with any of them since they love collecting magic items.\n\nShade then tells you he\u2019ll be preparing things on his side and in the unlikely event that you actually manage to get Dornan help and depending on how much help, you two can plan out your next move at that time. With those last words, Shade seemingly disappears into the darkness completely.\n\nThe next day you explain the situation to Vera and Warts. Neither one is exactly enthused about the idea, but they\u2019re just glad you\u2019re not asking either of them to do it.\n\n\u201cHope Yag\u2019s rolling in yer favor.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cIf he is, I hope he does better than he did for his loyal worshippers. Just wish I had something more than this pair of dried unicorn balls as a possible offering...Warts are you even sure this shit is magical?\u201d You say.\n\u201cItz from a unicorn ain\u2019t it? Itz magic trust me. Witch doctors grind dem up and make inta potions dat make yer dick HARD. Youz can last fer hours let me tell ya. One time wit Snuffit, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, don\u2019t need to hear the details. Anyway, guess it\u2019ll have to do.\u201d\n\u201cAt the risk that you\u2019ll take me with you, are you sure you should go attempt to do this alone?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m literally going to speak to a bunch of people that practically eat, sleep and shit magic. If they decide to kill me, there is little anyone else in the League is going to be able to do to help so there\u2019s really no point in anyone else getting potentially disintegrated. That\u2019s probably not going to happen, but in case shit does go south and I don\u2019t come back, I guess it\u2019ll be up to you lead this organization.\u201d\n\u201cWhat seriously?\u201d\n\u201cWell you and Warts are the closest thing I have to seconds and I doubt if Warts wants the commitment. So you\u2019re the obvious choice.\u201d\n\u201cGot dat right. Barely wanna do the shit I hafta.\u201d Warts interjects.\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s a huge responsibility and a lot of trust in me. I\u2019m not sure what to say, thanks I guess.\u201d Vera says responding to you.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not dead yet, so don\u2019t start sweating or celebrating prematurely. Okay, I\u2019m off.\u201d\n\nYou set off to the temple of Dorna. Along the way you see several groups of Joachimite fanatics preaching their faith to passersby. Most of the citizens are just trying to go about their day and are meekly just accepting the various pamphlets the Joachimites are aggressively distributing. Your own League members should be so intimidating.\n\nYep, their ranks definitely need to be whittled down severely. You\u2019re just hoping the Dornans will help. That\u2019s what you\u2019re most concerned about, because if you don\u2019t get their help in some meaningful way, you know full well you\u2019ll be taking some losses if it turns into a straight up fight with the Joachimites.\n\nThe closer you get to the area of Dorna\u2019s temple, the less people you see around in general. The force field that shimmers in and out of existence and surrounds the temple has certainly done its job in keeping everyone away.\n\nWhen you get so close to the place that you could actually touch the field if you wanted to, you notice that beyond the field there is a robed individual sitting on steps to the entrance and reading a book.\n\n\u2018Hello?\u201d you say in order to get their attention. The robed individual looks up and you see it\u2019s a woman. She puts her books aside to address you.\n\n\u201cOh hello. Not many people even walk this way anymore let alone get this close. Last ones who tried were those silly Joachimites. They learned the hard way of course. So anyway, my name is Heather and what brings the leader of the infamous Nocturnal League here?\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes of course! We\u2019re the worshippers of Dorna! Goddess of not just magic but of knowledge! We try to make it a point of knowing everything and everyone that might be important for one never knows when the knowledge may come in handy.\u201d\n\u201cHm, never realized I actually was all that important really.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an underworld boss who not only orchestrated the downfall of the Thieves Guild, but also the Ebony Claw Syndicate chapter in this city. THEN you created your own organization, which has quickly started to gain the same influence as the ECS once did here. You are also known to be very dangerous with firearms, particularly your custom made one. While you\u2019re probably not important in the grand scheme of the world, you\u2019re definitely important in this city at least.\u201d\n\nYou chuckle at that brief history of yourself.\n\n\u201cWell I suppose that\u2019s all true, though I had good reasons for everything.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course you did. And I imagine you\u2019re also here for another good reason. So what is it that you want?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cTo cut to the chase, I wish to speak to your Elder Flynn as I\u2019m seeking your help in taking down the Joachimites. I believe it is in everyone\u2019s best interest that they aren\u2019t allowed to spread in this city. Plus, I figure your group of all people would finally want to put an end to this religious war.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well seeing as we\u2019ve already made it impossible for the Joachimites or anyone else for that matter to attack us, the war is already over as far as we\u2019re concerned.\u201d\n\u201cBut if the Joachimites win, they\u2019ll be coming for you next and just because they were turned back by your barrier before doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try when they have no more opponents left. Hell, if they become very influential they may even gain the help of the government to kick you out.\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe that will happen. You are allied with the Felians are you not?\u201d\n\u201cWe came to an understanding, yes.\u201d\n\u201cThen the predictions came true. Elder Flynn was correct in predicting that eventually your group would get involved and side with what\u2019s left of the worshippers of Fel. He also predicted that such an alliance would result in your side\u2019s victory. So with that in mind, I don\u2019t believe the Elder would have any more to speak on the matter. The Joachimites will be destroyed. The Felians will be in no condition to do anything to us assuming they survive at all and your organization will be so weakened that even if you were any sort of rival to us, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything either.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not asking you to put your asses on the line at all. I was just told that you\u2019d have something to help take down this Inquisitor asshole who seemingly has almost as much magical protection as you lot do. I mean I can pay you guys.\u201d\n\u201cYou have anything magical on you?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cI got these!\u201d you say and hold up a large leather pouch containing the unicorn testicles.\n\nMeanwhile Heather stands behind the barrier doing something with her hands. When you realize she might be casting a spell, you get nervous.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cChecking something. Hmm, interesting. Very interesting. Perhaps Elder Flynn will be interested in helping you after all.\u201d Heather says and suddenly an opening in the barrier appears. \u201cWell? Come on in, I\u2019m not supposed to leave this open for very long!\u201d\n\nWasting no time, you enter and the barrier closes behind you. Heather tells you to follow her.\n\n\u201cDid you want these now?\u201d you ask shoving the leather pouch at her.\n\u201cWhat? No and Elder Flynn isn\u2019t going to want those things either. In fact, just put those away.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you let me in?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got something far more magical than a pair of glorified horse balls. You\u2019ve got ties to the infernal realm! You were marked by a succubus!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026um\u2026oh. Uh\u2026\u201d is about all you can spit out since you\u2019re taken off guard by the statement. Also you\u2019re not exactly sure what this means exactly. Heather seems pretty excited though.\n\n\u201cAnd it appears that you\u2019ve been marked for quite awhile. Succubi aren\u2019t known for keeping their mortal mates alive for very long. Maybe a year a most and most non-magical humans can\u2019t withstand the drain for extended periods of time. How did you pull this off? Nevermind, you can tell Flynn all about it when I bring you to him, he\u2019ll be just as interested in all this as I am.\u201d\n\nHeather leads you into the temple which almost resembles more of a library than a place of worship. Several other Dornans see Heather and you and disapproval already ensues.\n\n\u201cHeather! What the hell are you doing?!\u201d one yells\n\u201cWhy have you let an infidel inside our sanctum?\u201d another adds.\n\u201cGuys relax! He\u2019s no threat to us and I have a good reason! Elder Flynn will want to meet this one!\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cOh? I will, will I?\u201d another voice says before a set of double doors opens up.\n\nThere you see an old man in robes. He looks very much like what you\u2019d think a wizard would look like, or in his case priest-wizard. Heather wastes no time in telling him (and everyone else) that you\u2019ve been marked by a succubus and also how you want help against the Joachimites.\n\nElder Flynn does a similar thing with his hands that you saw Heather do and he comes to the same conclusion.\n\n\u201cI see. Well our criminal friend here certainly does have a unique condition. I would be very interested in learning how this came about exactly.\u201d Elder Flynn remarks.\n\u201cMay I sit in on this Elder?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cVery well, you may observe, but do not speak. As for the rest of you, return to your tasks. I will call upon you when needed. Now then you, follow me into my chambers and tell me your tale. Then perhaps we can come to some sort of deal.\u201d\n\nYou and Heather follow Elder Flynn into his chambers which contains a lot of tables filled with bottles, jars, and other laboratory equipment. More books of course and several strange markings on the floor.\n\nElder Flynn motions you to take a seat and you do so before explaining \u201cyour tale\u201d as it were.\n\nYou talk about Tanya for quite awhile. Honestly, it\u2019s kind of nice to talk about her as you\u2019ve never done so before. Not even to Warts, even though you know he\u2019s aware about what occurred between you two. Flynn sits and listens very intently, never interrupting and just writing notes on parchment. Heather on the other hand looks like she wants to ask you all sorts of questions and is doing her best to not speak.\n\nWhile talking about Tanya is nice, you also remind yourself of the loss you feel without her around. You explain that it\u2019s not as bad as it was when you first parted ways, but every now and then you have that empty feeling. You also mention \u201cthe curse\u201d which peaks Flynn\u2019s interest even more. He asks you several questions on that, which you answer.\n\n\u201cInteresting. It would seem that despite your girlfriend going against her nature she still managed to leave behind something that ultimately causes harm, even if it wasn\u2019t to you directly. Anyway, fascinating tale and I believe this is your lucky day.\u201d Flynn remarks.\n\u201cIt is?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, how would you like my help AND get rid of your curse?\u201d\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d\n\u201cI believe it is possible, however you\u2019d have to undergo a ritual first.\u201d\n\u201cUm, what sort of ritual?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re bonded with a demon. Doesn\u2019t matter if she wasn\u2019t born a pure blood anymore because she\u2019s obviously embraced her heritage fully now. That bond might be dormant and perhaps even non-malignant, but it exists. Which means at any time she can reach you, but it also means YOU can reach her. You of course don\u2019t have the means, but I on other hand do. I\u2019m proposing that we perform a ritual to bring this Tanya back here.\u201d\n\nThis proposal is getting strange and giving you all sorts of mixed feelings. On one hand you\u2019d like nothing more than to see her again, but on the other\u2026\n\n\u201cUm, okay so when Tanya is brought back here, then what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I bind her of course.\u201d Flynn remarks.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cProperly bound infernals can be very useful sources of knowledge as well as servants. She\u2019ll be a good addition to the temple. Also when I bind her, her hold on you will also be broken and you\u2019ll be free.\u201d\n\nAt this point you stand up and have to do everything within your power to not attack Flynn. You know he\u2019d probably easily disintegrate you before you could even do anything, but the temptation is still there. However you aren\u2019t adverse to verbal abuse.\n\n\u201cNo, fuck you and fuck this plan.\u201d You say as calm as you can.\n\u201c(Sigh) I thought you might say that. You\u2019re missing the big picture.\u201d Flynn remarks.\n\u201cWhat big picture?! You\u2019re talking about enslaving my fucking girlfriend! You didn\u2019t think I might get pissed about that?\u201d\n\u201cPlease just calm down. We were getting along before.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cYeah? Well that\u2019s probably because you lot weren\u2019t talking about imprisoning my girlfriend before and having me play a role in that! How would you like it if you had to be part of a magic ritual you didn\u2019t want any part in?\u201d\n\u201cIf it was in pursuit of greater knowledge and wisdom, I\u2019d be willing to make that sacrifice.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear you say that Heather, because I will need your assistance in this ritual.\u201d Flynn remarks.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI need something to help call the demon back to this realm just to give the spell a little more power. Usually for most demons this requires a sacrifice of some sort, however given that Tanya is a succubus, I don\u2019t think blood will be necessary, so fortunately I just need you to have sex with him inside the circle.\u201d\n\nHeather\u2019s face looks completely dumb struck. She has no words. You on the other hand are just shaking your head and giving a cynical laugh about it all.\n\n\u201cThis just gets better and better. Tell me, are you going to be jacking your old wrinkled dick the whole time too?\u201d\n\nYour crude remark is enough to finally set off Elder Flynn\u2019s temper.\n\n\u201cLook, you glorified cut throat, just THINK for a moment! The Tanya you knew is GONE. She left you for the infernal realm a LONG time ago and probably forgotten about you. In fact you\u2019re very lucky she has because I guarantee that she is NOT the same woman you knew. She has most likely become a being of pure evil, no matter what she might have told you before she left. Any concept of love would be gone by now along with any affection for you.\u201d Flynn rants.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, I DO know that! I\u2019ve done far more studies and forgotten more about infernals than you\u2019ll ever know and there is one constant, they always\u2026ALWAYS become creatures of mayhem, chaos and destruction in one way or another, and have no affection for ANYONE, let alone anyone far weaker than themselves.\u201d\n\nElder Flynn says this with such conviction that you don\u2019t respond and are just wondering if you\u2019re going to be able to get out of here alive.\n\n\u201cNow I know this is all very emotional for you, but I think you\u2019re smart enough to see that I know what the hell I\u2019m talking about on this subject. And if that doesn\u2019t convince you, then consider this. By participating in this ritual, you\u2019ll be free of Tanya\u2019s grip on you. No longer will you feel the loss of her presence and better yet, you\u2019ll be able to love another without putting their life in danger. Doesn\u2019t that alone sound worthwhile? And I\u2019m not even counting the help I will give you against the Joachimites. So you see, there is no downside to this deal.\u201d\n\nYou have to admit, Flynn is making a pretty sound argument. There have been many times you\u2019d like to \u201cmove on\u201d but it\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t unless you go through with this ritual.", "action_results": [{"action": "Do the ritual", "result": "Not exactly ideal circumstances but if this is what it\u2019s going to take to break the curse along with gaining help from the Dornans then this is what you need to do. Part of you still feels bad about betraying Tanya like this and you\u2019re not looking forward to when you \u201cmeet\u201d her again. Still, Flynn is probably correct in that she is most likely not the same girl anymore.\n\n\u201cVery well, if this is the only way.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re finally thinking rationally. Okay, let\u2019s not waste anymore time, I\u2019m going to have my acolytes prepare the summoning room. Heather can take you to it in about ten minutes or so. Since she\u2019s going to be directly involved in this ritual, I would recommend that you take that time to start getting yourself ready. I trust you like girls and I assume that Heather is attractive enough for you. However, I understand if these conditions are making you feel a little under pressure so if Heather\u2019s physical charms aren\u2019t enough, we can resort to magic means if necessary. I\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t though since these types of things always work better under natural conditions.\u201d Elder Flynn remarks.\n\u201cUm, I think I can manage, but what about Heather? I mean are you fine to go along with this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe all make sacrifices in the pursuit of Dorna\u2019s wisdom.\u201d Heather says and looks a little embarrassed and resigned by this whole situation.\n\u201cIndeed. I\u2019ll see you both soon.\u201d Flynn says and leaves.\n\nYou look at Heather as she looks at you.\n\n\u201cHeather we really don\u2019t have to if\u2026\u201d you start to say before she\u2019s all over you.\n\nYou don\u2019t really resist at this point though you do have to eventually stop her.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m suitably in the mood if that was what you were trying to accomplish, I think we better get to the summoning room before the magic happens prematurely.\u201d You say.\n\nHeather just acknowledges the obvious and tells you to follow her. She seems to be trying to maintain a certain detachment about all this. You can honestly say if you were her, you certainly wouldn\u2019t be doing it, then again you\u2019ve never had that much dedication to a deity either which seems to be her main motivation and perhaps intimidation by Flynn.\n\nWhen you get to the summoning room, Flynn is already there with some of his people. Flynn nods when he sees you and Heather.\n\n\u201cAh, there you are, if you two can get undressed and get in that circle, you can commence with the consummation.\u201d Flynn says.\n\u201cUm, is there anything else we have to do?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You two just focus on the physical part of this ritual and we\u2019ll be doing the rest. Though it is going to be vital that you last at least more than two minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll manage. Sheesh.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Also, and I feel I need to stress this again, when your succubus appears, it is vital that you DO NOT LISTEN to ANYTHING she has to say! In fact, you should just get the hell out of the room as soon as possible. You can wait elsewhere in the temple while we finish binding the demon.\u201d\n\nYou almost want to say something, specifically argue with Flynn, but you know that\u2019s not going to help and will be useless. You need to let Tanya go even if it is hard to do. This is going to be for your own good. It\u2019s also going to get you help with the Joachimites, which is sort of the main reason why you came here in the first place, but that seems more like a secondary concern now.\n\nAs you\u2019re getting undressed, Heather briefly says that she\u2019d like to be on top during all this. You see no reason to disagree since it\u2019s all going to get the job done and you figure maybe it eases her mind that she at least is going to have some \u201ccontrol\u201d over the situation. (Or maybe she\u2019s just more comfortable that way)\n\nSoon you and Heather are in position and it\u2019s almost like she\u2019s read your mind about the awkwardness of an audience since she whispers in your ear\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me and you here, just relax and ignore everything else except me, I\u2019m your whole world right now.\u201d\n\nShe then follows that up with a fairly passionate kiss and rhythmic motion of her body.\n\nYou don\u2019t know if Heather is using some sort of magic on you after all, or she\u2019s just that good, either way she knows what the hell she\u2019s doing and you\u2019re completely at ease and able to ignore the weird chanting of Flynn and his people.\n\nTime passes and eventually in-between the moaning and grunting, suddenly Heather begins to cough and she starts to wheeze.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019m\u2026fine\u2026\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem fine, maybe\u2026OW SHIT!\u201d\n\nHeather suddenly starts to dig her nails into your arms and is actively holding you down. It\u2019s enough for you to try to resist, but somehow she\u2019s a lot stronger than she appears. Not to mention she is putting all her weight on you and got you in locked in quite securely with her lower body. In fact it almost feels like she\u2019s crushing you.\n\n\u201cHeather, what the fuck! This is really fucking hurting! Get the hell off me! FLYNN!\u201d\n\nFlynn does absolutely nothing and just continues chanting, meanwhile Heather continues to look unwell and go on with her task. She starts to cough up blood on you.\n\n\u201cOh fuck, we need to stop this right now!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026gotta\u2026finish\u2026ugh\u2026I feel\u2026insides are on fire.\u201d\n\nAnd at this point blood is no longer just coming out of her mouth and given some of the other orifices, it isn\u2019t all blood either. You are covered in blood, shit and vomit from nearly head to toe and that\u2019s not the worst of it.\n\nThe worst of it is whatever is happening to Heather isn\u2019t just expressing itself with bodily excretions, Heather\u2019s magical powers are also starting to go wild. Her nails that were digging into your flesh now feel like hot coals as you can see her hands starting to glow a red color.\n\nFighting the urge not to vomit yourself, you desperately try to get Heather off of you, but again she\u2019s firmly wrapped around you and pinning you down.\n\nYou call for Flynn to help you and even Heather starts to scream for assistance as it seems she is not completely in control of her own body.\n\nNo help comes though and it\u2019s apparent that Flynn doesn\u2019t give a shit about either one of you at this point.\n\nYou manage to finally get one of your arms free, but it\u2019s a little late since now part of your own flesh is in flames. Punching Heather in the face a few times only results in her instinctively retaliating with blast of lightning to YOUR face.\n\nYou collapse back to the floor as Heather\u2019s screams get fainter to your ears and your last sight before your vision fades, is Heather\u2019s body literally ripping and exploding into bloody chunks of gore and now a different form looms over you.\n\nYou can\u2019t make any detail out except the outline of a much taller impressive demonic looking figure.\n\n\u201cTanya\u2026I\u2019m\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d you utter before you pass the world.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Refuse to do the ritual", "result": "Maybe you\u2019re not thinking rationally and you\u2019re also still holding on to lingering feelings for Tanya, but that doesn\u2019t also stop you from being suspicious of this ritual anyway.\n\nThe fact that you have to fuck one of Flynn\u2019s disciples for this is already enough to raise an eyebrow from you, but even if this is all on the level and Flynn is being completely truthful, you can\u2019t bring yourself to do this only for Tanya to be enslaved to this asshole.\n\nTanya may very well be a creature of evil that\u2019s doing horrible things and no longer cares about you, but that doesn\u2019t negate the memories that you have of her. You remember that one of her stronger traits is that she cherished her freedom. If you sentenced her to magical enslavement, you\u2019d feel pretty damn shitty about yourself and you\u2019re fairly certain you\u2019d just replace your sense of loss with a bigger sense of guilt. Hell, it probably would be better just to kill her.\n\n(You also never realized how very against slavery you are no matter what form or who it is. You suppose love of freedom is something)\n\nThere is also the fact that you have no idea if Flynn\u2019s spell is going to keep her imprisoned forever or if it\u2019s even going to work. If you go ripping Tanya from wherever she is into a magical prison, you can bet that you\u2019re going to be right near the top of her shit list if she ever escapes and you don\u2019t fancy your chances if Flynn turns out to be no match for her.\n\nSo you\u2019re not doing this for various reasons. Still, you have your concerns about getting out of here so you calm yourself down and address Flynn in a civil manner again.\n\n\u201cElder Flynn, I apologize for my outburst towards you earlier. Out was out of line, but as you can tell my feelings in all this are very intertwined. I can\u2019t easily separate them even if I know it would be rational to do so. I loved and still love Tanya no matter what she\u2019s become. Maybe\u2026maybe I just need more time to think about it, but I cannot bring myself to do this thing. At least not now.\u201d\n\nElder Flynn stares at you a bit, strokes his beard and then finally answers you.\n\n\u201cVery well. I believe you are being foolish about all this, but then those that do not follow Dorna are often mere babes in their cribs when it comes to greater wisdom. I certainly hope you do change your mind, but if you do come here again, you had best make sure you are VERY certain to go through with it. I will not be so understanding on a second intrusion. Heather, escort our guest out.\u201d\n\nHeather motions you towards the door quietly and you nod once more at Flynn before exiting. Your walk to the temple entrance is silent as a few acolytes watch you leave, but say nothing.\n\nFinally when you\u2019re outside, Heather speaks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming back are you?\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cIf you were in my position, would you?\u201d you replies\n\u201cProbably not. I want to say though it was very wise of you to address Elder Flynn in a respectful manner and I even understand your feelings on this matter.\u201d\n\u201cHm, for all the good it\u2019s going to do. Oh well, I\u2019m at least getting out of here in one piece, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re glad you don\u2019t have to fuck a complete stranger.\u201d\n\nHeather makes a nervous laugh.\n\n\u201cYes, well there is that. Not that you\u2019re unattractive mind you, but\u2026well it was a bit awkward. Under different circumstances it might have been fun, but I suppose you\u2019re forever bound to another.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cLooks that way.\u201d You answer.\n\nHeather opens a hole in the barrier, which you step through. Before you make your way back home, Heather asks if you can wait a moment and then runs back inside the temple. You\u2019re not exactly sure what Heather is up to, but you put some space between you and the barrier in the meantime.\n\nShe comes back out fairly quickly and after making another hole in the barrier she hands you a solid black glass sphere through it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an null orb and it\u2019s from my own personal collection.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it do?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you break it, it will completely nullify all magic in the immediate area for a time. I\u2019m fairly certain it should take down whatever the magic defenses that the Joachimite Inquisitor might have. You\u2019ll still have to get in close and you\u2019ve got one shot, but you\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d\n\nYou look at the orb for a moment as if you\u2019re going to see something other than utter blackness before putting it away.\n\n\u201cThank you Heather. This is more than I expected. I\u2019ll remember this.\u201d You say.\n\nHeather nods and you finally put this whole odd meeting behind you.\n\nWhen you get back to the League Lair, Vera looks like she\u2019s relieved that you made it back. You guess she was still sort of overwhelmed by the idea that she might be running things.\n\n\u201cYou made it back alive, so I\u2019m guessing you were successful?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t unsuccessful. I\u2019ve got something that supposedly will help against this Inquisitor, but it\u2019s a one shot deal. The next step is speaking with Shade again though and how we\u2019re going to set up this attack.\u201d You say.\n\nIn the next few days Shade finally manages to get around to speaking with you again. He tells you he\u2019s been placing what little remains of his manpower in gathering information and has determined exactly where the Inquisitor is currently staying which apparently is a humble house where a normal Joachim fearing couple lives. He says nothing is special about this couple and has no idea why the Inquisitor is staying there, but that\u2019s where he\u2019s been.\n\nShade also mentions that looks are very deceiving however on the external security front. Shade says it took all of his willpower to keep up his shadow magic to remain undetected (And apparently years off his life given that he looks older than he should now), but he learned that the Inquisitor has been using similar illusionary magic to make Joachimite fanatics invisible as well. Several of these invisible holy warriors are just laying in wait in case of an attack.\n\n\u201cNow, I doubt either side is going to remain hidden for very long from each other but as soon as we attack, the Inquisitor will soon intervene directly and then we\u2019ll be at a complete disadvantage.\u201d Shade says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got something that\u2019s going to make magic in general completely useless to everyone.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo you were successful then. Mind telling me what you have?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an item that you need to break within the vicinity of the Inquisitor. You just need to get in close enough to do it though. As long as that happens however, his defenses will go down and he\u2019ll be vulnerable to everything. Here.\u201d You say and hand the orb to Shade.\n\nShade doesn\u2019t take it and instead gives you a bit of a suspicious look.\n\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not a trick.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cMaybe not, but forgive me if I\u2019m less trusting of the Dornans than you are.\u201d\n\u201cShade, YOU told me to seek their aid if possible and I got it. What more do you want?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, but I have no idea if that thing strips magic ability permanently or what. For all I know Flynn is setting us all up.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not, because I didn\u2019t get this from fucking Flynn, I got this from a different Dornan.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that makes me feel even better. You got it from one of his lessers. To be honest, IF this IS indeed the powerful item you believe it to be, I\u2019m a little leery that you\u2019re so freely giving it to me, rather than keeping it for yourself.\u201d\n\nYou know this isn\u2019t going to help matters, but given what you\u2019ve been through already\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving it to you because your weak ass magic is already going to be fucked by the Inquisitor so you don\u2019t have anything to lose. Not to mention that between the pair of us, YOU are the close combat expert so you\u2019ll most likely get in closer than I\u2019ll be able to since we still have to fight through all those fanatics. Fucking hell Shade, I\u2019m doing YOU a fucking favor, so stop being a paranoid asshole and take the damn orb in the spirit of our fucking alliance that its being offered!\u201d\n\nShade\u2019s stare softens a bit and he even smirks a bit before taking the orb.\n\n\u201cVery well, you\u2019ve made your point. Let it be known though if something goes wrong and we both survive it, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Shade says.\n\u201cFair enough. Anyway I\u2019ll be hand picking my own people for the attack along with still being there in person since it\u2019ll be the only way I\u2019ll feel comfortable that my orders are going to be carried out. We probably should look at a map of this area to go over the details better.\u201d You say.\n\nYou spend a couple more days planning and preparing. Despite his magic going to be rendered impotent, Shade still wants to attack at night since he feels his people are still going to hold advantage over the Joachimites during that time. Since you don\u2019t have any real preference, you agree.\n\nThe night of the attack comes and you lie in wait from a distance with your people. You soon hear the scuffles and shouts of battle. Unlike the faithful of Fel, the faithful of Joachim aren\u2019t exactly the most quiet when they fight.\n\nYou soon join the fight and find that there are indeed a lot of Joachimites that seem to be coming out nowhere. They are screaming their deity\u2019s name and how they\u2019re going to purge all unbelievers, still they seem a little take off guard when you arrive.\n\nShade so far is holding the advantage due to him and his people teleporting all over the place, but you imagine that won\u2019t last long. In the meantime, you order your people to stay together and not get surrounded.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes of combat, the streets are starting to pile up with bodies. You half expect the Watch to arrive with all the noise going on, but then the government has for the most part taken a slightly hands off approach to the religious conflict since it started, which explains why it\u2019s gone on as long as it has.\n\nAnd then the Inquisitor finally makes his arrival. You\u2019ve never seen the guy before, but he certainly makes an impression especially since he emanates a white light from his person making him visible to all even in this darkness. He looks exactly like how Shade described him, though he\u2019s also carrying a mace in his hand.\n\n\u201cFOUL FOLLOWERS OF FEL! LET TONIGHT BE YOUR LAST!\u201d his voice booms and then suddenly several beams of light from the sky seem to target every Felian in the street, as soon as you see this, you tell your own people to find cover wherever they can.\n\nShade\u2019s people are unable to simply teleport or even turn invisible. A few barely manage to find cover before the beams of light completely ignite the unfortunate ones that couldn\u2019t escape.\n\n\u201cBURN IN THE PURE LIGHT OF JOACHIM! THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM HIS TRUTH!\u201d\n\nShade himself is unfortunate enough to not react in time before being caught in this light. He is set aflame, however fortunately for you he has enough in him to take out the null orb and throw it to ground. It shatters and suddenly the white light surrounding the Inquisitor disappears and so do the beams of white light coming from the sky.\n\nThe Inquisitor starts screaming prayers to Joachim, but nothing happens, the rest of his people seem confused by this sudden \u201cdisappearance\u201d of their divine weapon, but you\u2019re not confused and you urge your people to press the advantage since Shade is obviously no longer in any shape to do so.\n\nYou keep your eyes on the Inquisitor (Who is still pretty visible in the dark due to his white robes) and unsurprisingly realizing he doesn\u2019t have his magic advantage anymore, he runs away. Though you were expecting him to just start running down the street, instead he runs back in the house he was staying at.\n\nYou waste no time in following him, fighting and dodging along the way. You kick the door in and you find the Inquisitor standing in the middle of the room with his mace held ready for battle. An old couple stands further behind, frightened out of their minds and holding each other.\n\n\u201cYOU! I knew you were an infidel, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d thrown your lot in with the blasphemous shadow worshippers! No matter, you too shall face the righteous justice of\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile the Inquisitor is giving a monologue, you take the opportunity to end this by shooting him several times. He falls backwards crashing into a table and knocking over several other items as well. The old woman screams and begins sobbing.\n\nYou walk over to the Inquisitor\u2019s body to make sure he\u2019s dead and see that he is indeed still alive, but he won\u2019t be for long. In between his gasping and wheezing he tries to speak.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026ki\u2026please\u2026not\u2026\u201d he says.\n\u201cLittle late for that.\u201d You reply reloading your pistol.\n\u201cNot me\u2026par\u2026ents\u2026for\u2026old times\u2026please\u2026\u201d\n\nYou look over at the old couple and guess the Inquisitor means them. You suppose you know why he came running back in here now. What you don\u2019t get is that he seems to know you and not just by reputation.\n\nAt this point the Inquisitor\u2019s parents run over and kneel by him. Both are sobbing and his mother lifts his head a bit and removes the white mask he was wearing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026coming home\u2026Joachim\u2026I see his light\u2026\u201d Yinen remarks and then he dies.\n\nYou did not see that one coming. Of course you never knew his parents either.\n\nYou aren\u2019t even sure how you feel about it. What caused this radical transformation? You can somewhat guess that perhaps Yinen never quite got over his experience of getting captured by the Neroth cultists. His return to his Joachimite upbringing to the point of zealotry was the result.\n\nYou wish you had known Yinen was the inquisitor the whole time. Maybe you could have spoke to him. Maybe not. Doesn\u2019t matter now, it\u2019s done.\n\nYou leave Yinen\u2019s parents to their grief and dead son.\n\nAs for the battle outside, it\u2019s winding down with your side winning, but you\u2019ve suffered more than few losses. Still, could have been worse.\n\nThe few Felians still left have managed to bring Shade back from the brink of death, but he\u2019s a mess, what with burns all over his body and the fact he previously pre-maturely aged himself. This war has cost him quite dearly. You actually don\u2019t think he\u2019ll live too much longer or if he does, he\u2019s going to be spending the rest of his days as a cripple. However, apparently he\u2019s pleased that this was a \u201cwin.\u201d He even manages to say a genuine statement of gratitude. Saying that the Temple of Fel will come to the aid of the Nocturnal League if you ever need it.\n\nYou imagine this \u201cwar\u201d won\u2019t entirely be over just by the events tonight, but this was definitely a big turning point and probably in a few months, it\u2019ll be over completely and then you can refocus back on business.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 29\n\nLot can change in just a few years, some things you predicted, others not so much.\n\nThe Church of Joachim being outlawed in the city wasn\u2019t too surprising given all the trouble that was caused and how Holgard in general tends more towards embracing sin and vice rather than moving away from it. Still, sort of funny that the faith is now in the company of it\u2019s eternal enemy, Neroth as far as being illegal.\n\nAs for the other faiths, only the temples of Dorna and Fel maintain any presence in the city and in the Felians case, that\u2019s thanks to Shade dying soon after the war was over and the new leader Gloom, making an effort to strengthen their relationship with the upper echelons of the government, namely Baroness Ludmilla.\n\nGloom has also extended a hand to the Nocturnal League, stating that the temple would be more than willing to come to an understanding like it had with the Ebony Claw Syndicate and train your members in shadow magic.\n\nYou declined that offer though. You\u2019ve always said members are free to pray to whoever they want, but if they\u2019re going to be wrapped up in Fel (or whoever) that hardcore then they can go take up some black robes and start living in their temple\u2019s meditation rooms. The less religion you have in your organization the better.\n\nStill, your cordial relationship with the temple has had benefits you hadn\u2019t intended. Due to the Felians being on better terms with the Baroness, some of that \u201cunderstanding\u201d has inadvertently trickled down towards you. As a result the Nocturnal League has freer reign over the city than it once did. Possibly similar to what the ECS once had.\n\nSo things are going good for the Nocturnal League and business couldn\u2019t be better. You haven\u2019t had any decisions of the major kind lately, but for whatever reason this has caused you to sometimes over think the minor ones now that do crop up.\n\nLike right now for instance.\n\n\u201cYou were invited to the Baroness\u2019 yearly costume party? How the hell did that happen and why aren\u2019t you immediately making preparations to go?!\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cJust one of the perks of being allied with the temple of Fel I suppose. Gloom had one of his members deliver this letter to me a week ago. Apparently Baroness Ludmilla has heard interesting things about me and would like me to show up at her party so she can see for herself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShe thinks yer intresstin\u2019? She really doesn\u2019t know youz at all.\u201d Warts snarks and chuckles at his own attempt at a joke.\n\u201cWell, you have to go right? I mean it\u2019s the Baroness.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cI dunno. I mean I suppose I see why I should, just don\u2019t really feel up to it.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cWhat? When the Baroness of Holgard calls you to court, you have to go!\u201d\n\u201cNever knew you were such a supporter of our dear ruler. You secretly harboring royalist admiration?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that! I mean yeah she\u2019s royalty, but not really. I mean\u2026 I dunno, I\u2019ve always sort of admired how she took power from her father and brother I guess. She\u2019s a very powerful independent woman and has remained that way. I guess that\u2019s what I admire.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well I guess I just see her as another corrupt aristocrat that used her position of power to gain even more power. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing, but nothing special. Lot harder to do when you aren\u2019t born with a silver spoon in your mouth.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, we all know. You cleverly lied, cheated, stole and murdered your way to your position. You\u2019re the epitome of a self made man. We\u2019re all very impressed. Truly. I\u2019m wet just thinking about it. Still, I really think you should go to this party, if only so you don\u2019t inadvertently offend her which then will cause our current friendly relationship with the law to become unnecessarily complicated.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I already took that into consideration. (Sigh) I suppose I\u2019m going, though the letter also says I should bring one more person with me since that\u2019s apparently the rule of this event.\u201d\n\nAs soon as you\u2019ve said that, Vera\u2019s eyes light up.\n\n\u201cMe! You gotta take me! Seriously I will seriously suck your dick if you take me to this party.\u201d Vera exclaims.\n\u201cYou mean aren\u2019t already?\u201d Warts responds.\n\u201cWha? Why is that your go to action with me?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want to do then, look I don\u2019t care! I just really gotta go to this thing!\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Wait a minute, you don\u2019t have a crush on the Baroness do you? I mean you were praising her pretty hard a moment ago.\u201d\n\u201cNo! This ain\u2019t about pussy bumpin! Its just\u2026(sigh) nevermind you\u2019ll just make fun and if you don\u2019t I know damn well this ugly half breed will.\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck you, Vera.\u201d\n\u201cWarts, step out of here. While there won\u2019t be any dick sucking involved, I am sort of interested in why Vera wants to go so badly.\u201d\n\u201cGruh, fine by me. I certainly don\u2019t wanna go. I gotta go see my kids anywayz, later.\u201d\n\nAfter Warts leaves you motion Vera to speak which she does though she\u2019s still a bit hesitant to do so, fearing that you\u2019ll make fun.\n\nVera suddenly goes into more of her life story than you ever thought to ask of her.\n\nShe mentions that her mother was once very briefly employed as a maid during the Baron\u2019s reign of the city. She goes on to say that her mother always told her that she once had a brief fling with him while she was cleaning one of the guest bedrooms. Unfortunately the Baron being the asshole he typically was, he had all the maids, including Vera\u2019s mother, replaced a week later because he claimed his palace wasn\u2019t getting clean enough.\n\nIn any case, Vera said that shortly afterwards, her mother discovered she was pregnant and claimed to the day she died that Vera\u2019s real father was really the Baron.\n\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re actually bastard royalty?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d make fun or not believe me.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not really that far fetched given what I\u2019ve always heard about the old Baron. Though I\u2019m just surprised you\u2019ve never mentioned it before. Seems like something you\u2019d brag about.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get myself fucking killed?! No thanks! One of the big reasons my mother never told anyone or even tried to get financial support from the Baron is the fear of some assassin coming in to kill her and me. I mean I\u2019m hardly the only illegitimate child the baron probably had and his son Farad was notorious for having suspected bastards killed. And if he didn\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t imagine Ludmilla was any different. Especially now.\u201d\n\u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, you\u2019re the ONLY person I\u2019ve told about this and now that I\u2019ve done it, I feel a little weird and vulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to say anything. Not like there would be anything to gain. Though I guess this is why you want to go to this party so badly huh? Experience what might have been? Possibly even briefly speak with your older half sister?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026sort of. I know it\u2019s silly, but\u2026sometimes I do think of a life that is different than this one.\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s thoughtful words are a little out of the ordinary, but not lost on you. Not like you don\u2019t have similar thoughts on your own life at times.\n\n\u201cOkay, I guess we\u2019ll go together then. Not like I can think of anyone else to take anyway. Says it\u2019ll be in three days so I suggest you prepare yourself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI will! Thank you for this boss!\u201d Vera beams.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, princess.\u201d You mock.\n\u201cSo, what are you going to be wearing?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Some mask of some sort I imagine since it\u2019s a costume party. Which makes me wonder, how the hell is the Baroness going to know it\u2019s me if I\u2019m wearing a mask?\u201d\n\u201cI imagine she\u2019s got some way of figuring it out. Make sure you dress nice though! I\u2019ve heard about these things and if we go in looking like we crawled out of the sewers, they\u2019ll turn us away, invitation or not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll take a trip to the tailor\u2019s or something.\u201d\n\nA few days and a trip to the tailor\u2019s later, you\u2019re dressed and ready to go to this thing. You\u2019re not exactly comfortable in this type of clothing, but many League members compliment you on your new threads. Warts of course has something to say.\n\n\u201cOh well la de da, if it ain\u2019t da duke of da undaworld.\u201d Warts say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even start, where the hell is Vera, she\u2019s the one that made a bigger deal of all this?\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen her yet? She\u2019s even fancier than you are right now. If it gets anymore highbrow here, we\u2019re gonna hafta forge all dat gold and silver we got inta fancy eatin\u2019 utensils.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well this is a one time thing. So where\u2019s Vera again?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s in her room I think\u2026um don\u2019t tell her I said so, but she iz sorta pretty. I mean she wouldn\u2019t be MY type, but y\u2019know dressed like she iz right now, she looks like of doze princesses or sumthin. Hah, Vera a princess, dat\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026hysterical. Later Warts.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head and go get Vera.\n\nYou don\u2019t even bother knocking on the door, you just enter and that\u2019s when you see Vera who turns around from her mirror to face you. She does indeed look a lot different than you\u2019re used to seeing her.\n\n\u201cWow. You look, really different.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood different or bad different?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cNeither\u2026I mean good of course. Look, I\u2019m just saying you could easily blend in with the rest of the aristocratic types. You\u2019re very pretty, like a princess and I\u2019m not just saying that.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. You look\u2026appropriate too.\u201d\n\u201cThe hell\u2019s that mean? I\u2019ll have you know I got a lot of compliments!\u201d\n\u201cWell of course you did, you\u2019re the boss. They\u2019re hardly going to tell you, you look like shit. Not that you do. You\u2019re fine. I guess we should get going, do you have your mask?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, got one of those half masks. Don\u2019t really feel like struggling to breath with a full mask on that covers my mouth and nostrils. Still covers most of my face so I figure I\u2019m good.\u201d You say and put it on.\n\u201cI think most people will be wearing those so, you\u2019ll fit in fine. I got one too.\u201d Vera says and puts on her her mask and the pair of you are soon on your way.\n\nWhen you get to the palace you\u2019re sort of relieved since you half expect that you\u2019re going to get robbed on your way there. A guard stops you at the gates and you show your personalized invitation at which point you\u2019re waved through.\n\nYou and Vera take a moment to sort of absorb the fact of where you actually are for a moment. The seat of rulership, the palace! The grounds are certainly well taken care of and it\u2019s obvious that every effort has been spared to make it look as festive as possible.\n\nThe closer you get to the palace the more grandiose everything is. You also notice the increase in guards and you and Vera are patted down more than once.\n\nYou get inside the palace and the elegance of the interior is about what you expect. Vera is practically enamored by everything. Right now, she\u2019s probably imagining herself as that princess you ribbed her about being. As for you, you\u2019re a bit more of a harder sell on being impressed by such things, but if you could run your organization from a place like this instead, you certainly wouldn\u2019t turn it down.\n\nYou and Vera spend a bit of time just looking around until Vera wonders if you should start actively mingling with some of the other guests. You\u2019re of course against this idea, but you soon are forced into doing so anyway by someone you weren\u2019t expecting to talk to, or at least not so early.\n\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the head of the Nocturnal League. Glad you could make it, I was hoping you would.\u201d\n\nAnd there you are standing before Baroness Ludmilla Varsakken. She wears no mask and at this close range you get a good look at her. She almost looks like she could be a vampire what with her skin on the paler side and the black hair accentuating it. She\u2019s beautiful of course, but just looking into her eyes a bit you can see a very ruthless woman before you. You also take a good look at her in general and then glance over at Vera.\n\nNow that you\u2019re looking at them both, there could very well be a family resemblance.\n\n\u201cWell, you certainly like to stare.\u201d Ludmilla says, noticing your examination.\n\u201cOh, um, apologies. Just sort of\u2026overwhelmed you know. Never thought I\u2019d be before royalty.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHah, not the complete uncouth rogue I\u2019ve heard our mutual Felian acquaintances tell me about I see. Good.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know it was me anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI make it a point of knowing all my guests as they arrive. Not to mention your clothing isn\u2019t exactly shall we say refined enough. While I\u2019m sure you thought it was very upscale looking, but the workmanship is obviously from one of the mediocre tailors in the city. Only a crimelord with no care for such extravagant airs would believe it to be sufficient for this party. Not to worry though, I will not hold it against you. You tried.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that, and your invitation.\u201d\n\u201cYou quite welcome, and who is your companion here? She certainly seems to have a better grasp on the dress code. I dare say this dress is better than a few of the boring nobles here.\u201d\n\u201cThank you! I had it custom made a long time ago. Always knew I\u2019d get to wear it some day!\u201d Vera says a bit excitedly.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I like to hear. A woman that plans in advance.\u201d\n\nAt this point Ludmilla begins speaking to Vera and you excuse yourself to get a drink. While you don\u2019t normally do so, you get the impression you\u2019re going to need a bit of extra help to get through the night.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even in this situation, let alone acting the way you are. Still, you suppose it makes for an interesting change.\n\nStill, you really don\u2019t want to be here all night. You made your appearance and now you\u2019d like nothing more than to leave. Vera however looks like she\u2019s having a good time and to be honest you don\u2019t want to ruin that. She does help you a lot with the League.\n\nSo you go back to Vera and Ludmilla and stand nearby in an attempt to be social. Ludmilla goes back and forth speaking to you and Vera, though she surprisingly is more talkative to Vera. The Baroness seems to like to talk and can already guess that you\u2019re not exactly the most gregarious.\n\nLudmilla and Vera talk for quite awhile, it\u2019s actually pretty amazing since it\u2019s about absolutely nothing. Or at least nothing you\u2019re much interested in. Ludmilla is mostly talking about herself and the troubles of being of noble birth. Goes on about how Vera\u2019s lucky to not have to worry about such things.\n\nCondescending of course, but if Vera noticed it, she\u2019s not fussed or at least not letting it show. It\u2019s sort of ironic anyway since Vera could very well HAVE had such problems if fate swung a different way.\n\nEventually though Ludmilla tells the pair of you that while she was pleased to meet you both, she has other guests to see, even though they probably won\u2019t be as interesting you are.\n\nAnd the pair of you are left on your own.\n\n\u201cWell that was interesting.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm. Certainly was. Never thought I\u2019d ever be directly in the presence of royalty before. Well not without my hands and feet in chains at least.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cHah! Same here. So, you ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Already? The party\u2019s just started and you want to leave?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean I dunno what else there really is to do here. I mean we came, we saw, we met the baroness. I mean we covered all the important shit. Not like I really have any desire to talk to any of the other assholes around here.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I wanted to stay a bit longer though. However, if you want to leave, I guess that\u2019s fine with me. You\u2019re the boss after all.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, we can stay a little longer, but I\u2019m going to find someplace away from most of these people. You can do what you like. I\u2019ll come looking for you in a while I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThanks boss, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Vera says and suddenly kisses you on the cheek before walking off to enjoy living the \u201chigh society life\u201d for a little longer.\n\nAs for you, you decide to just look around to waste time. You grab another drink and try to stick to less \u201cpopulated\u201d areas of the palace. Though obviously you\u2019re still limited to where you\u2019re allowed to go. Guards standby keeping an eye on everything.\n\nTime passes and while a few people attempt to speak to you, and few others seem to be talking about you (Mostly about your clothes) you basically ignore them all and just keep to your plan of moving about and sticking to areas where there are less people.\n\nWhile you\u2019re doing that however, you\u2019re also studying some of the lay out of the palace, or at least what you\u2019re able to. You also take notice of what valuable objects would be easy to take.\n\nYou briefly flirt with the idea of stealing something from this place, but common sense soon wins out. Last thing you want to do is even risk pissing off the Baroness, especially since you\u2019re on good terms with her. Still, sometimes you miss the days of when you just stole things for a living.\n\nAfter wandering a bit more and entertaining the idea of pilfering the palace, you discard your usual procedure of avoiding the crowds and walk towards a room where you hear some music followed by a lot of clapping.\n\nYou arrive just in time to see a crowd disperse before a group of musicians that apparently have just finished performing. Shame, from what little you heard, it sounded pretty good. You go and get yourself another drink and that\u2019s when you start to feel a little odd. Whatever this stuff is, it\u2019s apparently stronger than the taste would indicate. Still, it\u2019s a party right? Might as well try to loosen up.\n\nYou realize you\u2019re not nearly as fun loving as you used to be when you were younger. In fact, you\u2019re downright stodgy at times. All you practically do is fucking work. Being a criminal isn\u2019t fun anymore, it\u2019s actually not even dangerous at this point, it\u2019s just well\u2026 mundane.\n\nHow the hell did it come to this? If you wanted to be mundane, you might as well have stayed in Teckleville and followed in your dad\u2019s footsteps. Maybe he was right after all.\n\nNo. You\u2019ve seen and done much in your life thanks to leaving that boring town. After all, you\u2019re here in baroness\u2019 palace! You\u2019re just in a rut that\u2019s all. When you get back, you\u2019re going to shake things up within the League. Maybe expand again, maybe even to a new city like Hessla or Klyton.\n\nStill, it\u2019s all pretty pointless without someone to share it with. You couldn\u2019t go back home and say \u201cLook mom and dad, look at what I\u2019ve done!\u201d It sucks. Your sister would probably be impressed, but who knows where she is. You hope she\u2019s having more fun than you are right now. You miss her sometimes. Simpler times. Happier times.\n\nFuck it, you need another drink.\n\nAs you go to get another you bump into a couple that are making out.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d the woman says and strokes your arm as you pass by. The guy she\u2019s kissing takes no notice; he\u2019s too focused on her.\n\nYou briefly think of Vera and how she kissed you not too long ago. Makes you wonder if she\u2019s got more than a bit of attraction toward you. You know she\u2019s always making these sexual offers toward you, but as far as you know she\u2019s not really known to be the \u201cgood time\u201d girl within the Nocturnal League. So it makes you wonder if she actually feels affection towards you on some level. Sometimes you think about her too, since you work so closely together. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re an old married couple.\n\nOf course it could be a case that she\u2019s perfectly fine being a potential whore if it\u2019s going to benefit her in the long run. Since you\u2019re the boss, and the only one above her in rank, makes sense that she\u2019d only be offering you such extra \u201cbenefits.\u201d\n\nRegardless, you probably would have made a move on her if it wasn\u2019t for your condition.\n\nYou nearly bump into another couple also making out. By the time you grab your drink, you realize there are a lot of people kissing and hugging each other. And some of them are getting pretty hot and heavy.\n\nNow you think of Tanya.\n\nYou wish Tanya was still around. You\u2019d love to share your success with her, but you guess that she moved on a long time ago. She claimed you\u2019d move on, but you haven\u2019t. How could you? She was everything to you. If it wasn\u2019t for her, it\u2019s debatable that you would have even did any of this. You probably would have fucked around in Holgard for a few years and then just left when the Ebony Claw Syndicate started taking notice of you. She kept you around and made you fall in love with her.\n\nBut you can\u2019t hate her for that. It wasn\u2019t her fault. It just was her nature.\n\nYou look around and now you see several people doing more than just kissing now.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d you say to yourself and get up to leave. You must have wandered into some weird orgy room.\n\nYou make it to a hallway and that\u2019s when you\u2019re starting to feel really\u2026excited.\n\nYou\u2019ve got an erection right now that you could stab someone to death with and you are about ready to murder the closest woman available and worse, they\u2019re just about ALL available.\n\nHell, with the way you\u2019re feeling, you\u2019re starting to worry if you aren\u2019t going to just fuck everyone on your way to the exit because it\u2019s been YEARS since you\u2019ve had sex and right now your dick isn\u2019t caring.\n\nIt has to be the drinks. You\u2019re sure of it. This whole party is probably just an excuse for rich people to have decadent orgies anonymously with each other.\n\nYou need to get out of here before you kill everyone at this party with your cursed dick. The problem is you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re even going to make it that far.\n\nThe best you might be able to do is find a place with no people about and stay there until the effects of the drink wear off. (Whenever that is)", "action_results": [{"action": "Run to the exit", "result": "You need to just get the hell out of here, because staying is surely going to doom someone.\n\nYou continue your trip to the exit, trying not to look at any of the people having sexual encounters along the way. Several times you have to push people away after they grab at you. Eventually you just start punching them, and for a couple of them that just turns them on even more.\n\n\u201cUhn yeah, beat me harder! I like it like that!\u201d\n\u201cThis is fucked.\u201d You mutter.\n\nYou try to think of the most unattractive and least erotic things you can think of like the Holgard sewers, and similar things. You also hit yourself in crotch a few times and unlike the masochist freaks, that works to lessen your arousal. Doesn\u2019t get rid of it entirely though and you\u2019re not doing that too much more because it hurts like a sonofabitch.\n\nEventually you make it out of the palace. The guards don\u2019t even react when they see you and just shrug as you continue to run from the palace and out the gates into the city.\n\nAs soon as you\u2019re in the public area of the city again, you realize now you\u2019ve got another problem. Instead of having a strong sexual desire around a bunch of other people who are also suffering the same condition, you\u2019re now potentially around a bunch of people who aren\u2019t suffering it at all.\n\nYou try to walk down the more isolated street with nobody about, but you need to get off them entirely before you potentially start molesting someone or worse. You\u2019d go to a brothel, but if you did, you\u2019d just end up killing all your employees.\n\n\u201cHey, didn\u2019t expect to bump into you. I didn\u2019t realize you left the party too. Figured you were bedding some aristocrat or something.\u201d\n\nYou spin around and see Vera.\n\n\u201cVera, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI was on my way back home. Shortly after we separated I wandered and talked to a few people and even looked around seeing if I could steal anything, but there really wasn\u2019t a good opportunity, and then something weird happened.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cLet me guess, everyone got all friendly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, REALLY friendly. Didn\u2019t know it was going to be that kind of party. Guessing something was in the drinks. Glad I hadn\u2019t drank anything while I was there. Still, I might have paired up with one of the horny aristocrat guys if it had just been a one on one thing, but then Ludmilla was around and she started hitting on me too and I got really creeped out. I mean she didn\u2019t know of course, but she could potentially be my half sister, and that just really put me out of the mood entirely. I ran out as soon as I could.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, potentially fucking a sibling, I can see where that would put a damper on things\u2026\u201d you say barely able to contain yourself\n\u201cUm, what\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re fidgeting and sweating. You keep putting your hand on your crotch\u2026wait a minute. Did you have the drinks?\u201d\n\u201cVera, I\u2019m telling you, you need to leave me right now, because I\u2019m having a REALLY hard time here.\u201d\n\nVera smiles a bit and grabs at the obvious bulge in your pants. You nearly don\u2019t back away.\n\n\u201cShit. You ARE having a hard time. Well hell, come on let\u2019s put that to good use.\u201d\n\u201cVera, you need to seriously stop!\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh come on! I don\u2019t see what the hell is wrong with me! I mean shit; you act like I got the fucking plague! You\u2019re a real fucking asshole you know that?\u201d\n\u201cVera\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m going to say some shit that YOU need to hear! I know all about your ex-girlfriend. Warts mentioned that you were really head over heels for a demonkin once when he suggested that I was banging my head up against a wall with you. Said that\u2019s probably the real reason why you don\u2019t have any relationships at all because you\u2019re still in love with the infernal bitch.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well Warts don\u2019t know the whole fucking story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to know? You\u2019re obviously still holding a candle for her like a fucking idiot. You think she gives a shit about you? No. She was a DEMON. They don\u2019t give a shit about anything! And here you are still being faithful for a girl that isn\u2019t around meanwhile you outright continue to ignore people who ARE here and do care for you. Someone who knows your likes and dislikes. Someone who has done more than she would normally do and would probably do a lot more stupid shit because for some fucked up reason she really likes you.\u201d\n\nVera at this point looks down a bit and rubs her eyes.\n\n\u201cNo. LOVES you. More than you\u2019ll ever damn well know.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really know what to say. You always knew Vera had some attraction to you, but you didn\u2019t think it extended this far. Even with everything that\u2019s going on with your body right now, this information has made you focus on something other than sex.\n\n\u201cVera, I really don\u2019t know what to say, except if you believe that I haven\u2019t ever thought about us, well you don\u2019t know me as well as you think. Hell, tonight I even enjoyed pretending a bit that we were going out on some fancy date, well until the drugged drinks that is.\u201d\n\u201cThen what the hell\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is, I\u2019ll fucking kill you! My dick is fucking cursed!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m having a difficult time as it is trying not to be all over you right now, so here\u2019s the short version.\u201d\n\nYou quickly explain how you came to learn about your unfortunate condition and everything else relating to it. When Vera asks about a cure, you explain that the cost is too high from what you know about the one time it was offered to you.\n\n\u201cSo you see? I haven\u2019t been avoiding a relationship with you for no damn reason. I\u2019ve been trying to keep you alive! And if you want to stay that way, I\u2019d suggest you fucking leave right this minute. I need to go jerk off or something in an alley right now.\u201d You say.\n\nVera is silent for a moment\n\n\u201cOkay, well why don\u2019t I at least help you with that?\u201d Vera suddenly says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you at least let me jerk you off? I mean it\u2019s not sex right? You\u2019re not penetrating me. I\u2019m just going to be lending a helping hand as it were.\u201d\n\u201cVera, while I appreciate the offer, I\u2019m still not sure if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cLook, you know how I feel about you. And you\u2019re saying you have feelings for me, so isn\u2019t this the type of shit couples are supposed to do for one another? Help each other out?\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s the drink that\u2019s breaking down your willpower or Vera\u2019s fairly convincing argument, but you can\u2019t hold back anymore.\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay. I guess maybe you make a solid point. I\u2019m still really worried about you though.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. You just try to relax as I take care of everything. Let\u2019s go over there, that looks like a secluded spot.\u201d\n\nYou and Vera duck into an alleyway and soon Vera is helping you out directly.\n\nAnd then again.\n\nAnd then a third and FOURTH time and you\u2019re still not sated.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did they put into those drinks? Ground up unicorn testicles?\u201d Vera says wiping her hands.\n\u201cShit, this isn\u2019t working. Fuck what if its permanent?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this has to wear off eventually. We\u2019re just going to have to do something else.\u201d\n\nVera begins to lower herself.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d she asks\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that! You\u2019ll die!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sex right? I mean not really. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it counts, some of those other women blew me too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you also fucked them, and we\u2019re not doing that, so again just relax and let me take care of it.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026oh shit\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t even argue anymore as you feel the glory that is Vera\u2019s oral skills. Given how many times she\u2019s offered this to you in the past, this has got to be a major fantasy for her or something.\n\nSoon\u2026\n\n\u201cFuck. That was a lot. You good?\u201d Vera says wiping off her mouth a bit.\n\u201cI really wish I could say I was, but you\u2019re going to have to stay down there a little longer.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, as much fun as that was, I\u2019m not sucking your dick all night. You\u2019re putting that thing to better use.\u201d\n\nAt this point Vera begins lifting her dress up and grinding herself into you.\n\n\u201cVera! Shit! We REALLY can\u2019t do this! You WILL die!\u201d you say, but still holding on to her body tightly.\n\u201cY\u2019know what I\u2019ve been thinking? I think you\u2019re fucking imagining things. I think all those girls were just a bad coincidence and you jumped to conclusions because as I said, you\u2019re still holding a torch for your ex and felt guilty about it.\u201d Vera responds.\n\u201cWhat? Where do you get that idea from?\u201d\n\u201cI get that idea from the fact that you have no damn proof that your dick is cursed from what you\u2019ve told me. I mean if it really was cursed, I\u2019d think those women would have melted shortly after or something, not died from common shit like drug overdoses or fires. You just had a string of bad luck and made assumptions.\u201d\n\u201cVera, you can\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve never been one to play it too safe, so if this is it for me, there are worse ways. Might as well at least be because you fucked me. Now let\u2019s do this already.\u201d\n\u201cRight here in this dirty ass alley?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have any objections before when your dick was in my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cI still think this is a really bad idea\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see, now fuck me like it\u2019s my last night here, because it might very well be.\u201d\n\nAgainst your better judgment (or any judgment really) you finally give what Vera\u2019s always wanted from you.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 shit. Fuck, this is going to be good.\u201d She says as you enter inside her.\n\nYou\u2019ve barely gotten started fucking her up against a nearby wall and she\u2019s already trying not to make a lot of noise and failing at it.\n\nThis session quite unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s raw; it\u2019s dirty and it almost feels violent.\n\nAs you\u2019re giving it to Vera hard, she still manages to surprise you.\n\n\u201cPut your hands around my throat.\u201d She suddenly says.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh and call me a whore too. I want to imagine you\u2019re raping me in this alley. Y\u2019know like when you pretend threaten to do when we first met?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026sort of fucked up Vera\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m attracted to the likes of you, are you really all that surprised that I\u2019m a little fucked up?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re starting to get the impression that Vera\u2019s love for you is a little more twisted that you originally believed. You sort of wonder if it\u2019s been borderline obsession and she\u2019s just done a good job of keeping it together.\n\nYou\u2019re just not sure if this is such a good idea given that the women you have sex with tend to die afterwards.", "action_results": [{"action": "Decline the request", "result": "As horny as you are, there some things you don\u2019t really want to risk doing.\n\n\u201cVera, I\u2019m not going to start choking you. I practically feel like I\u2019m killing you already.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNot stopping you though is it? Come on, just choke me a little, I can take it.\u201d\n\u201cVera I really don\u2019t want to, can we just get on with this\u2026\u201d\n\nVera suddenly slaps you.\n\n\u201cVera\u2026\u201d\n\nVera then slaps you again harder.\n\n\u201cOkay stop that!\u201d\n\nVera doesn\u2019t and instead leans in and bites your ear so hard she draws blood.\n\n\u201cVERA WHAT THE FUCK!? THAT FUCKING HURT!\u201d you exclaim holding your ear.\n\u201cHelp! I\u2019m being raped!\u201d Vera shouts.\n\u201cShhhh! What the fuck are you doing!? You trying to get me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRAPE! RAPE! RAPE!\u201d\n\nAt this point you slam Vera against the wall and put your hand to her mouth.\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up! You trying to get the Watch to arrest us? Ow! My fingers!\u201d you exclaim as Vera manages to bite your fingers.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re genuinely angry. Under normal circumstances, you\u2019d probably just completely disengage, but seeing as you\u2019re still aroused, you decide to give into Vera\u2019s obvious kink.\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll give you what you want if only to shut you up!\u201d\n\u201cWell stop talking lover and just do it\u2026ulp\u2026yeah\u2026just like that\u2026\u201d\n\nYou place your hands around Vera\u2019s throat and begin choking her. At first it\u2019s only light, but as your thrusting gets quicker and harder, you begin tightening your grip.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026you can\u2026loosen up\u2026a bit\u2026\u201d Vera gasps.\n\nBut you don\u2019t. In fact your mind has gone into a very dark place. You start seeing images of death. Not just hers though. You see the deaths of all the other women you had sex with since Tanya.\n\n\u201cSt\u2026op\u2026\u201d Vera says and begins to struggle.\n\nYou don\u2019t even reply, you just continue strangling her. Vera now is fighting for her life, but despite kneeing you in the crotch several times, you\u2019re not even fazed. Even your desire for sex has been muted over your desire to kill her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never replace her! NEVER!\u201d you start to shout.\n\nYou are then suddenly smashed in the back of the head by something, causing you to collapse.\n\n\u201cLady are you alright? We were watching over there and saw him getting too rough!\u201d someone says, meanwhile someone else is still kicking you.\n\nWhile Vera is recovering and coughing, you pull your pistol.\n\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d Vera barely manages to utter before you blast the asshole that\u2019s currently kicking you.\n\nThe bum falls to the ground, and then the other tries to run, but you easily shoot him as well.\n\nVera, realizing that she can\u2019t run, tries to appeal to you.\n\n\u201cPlease, you have to stop this!\u201d she says.\n\nYou are really not thinking straight however. The drugs in your body combined with being pushed into aggressiveness and some unknown factor that\u2019s really causing you to have bloody thoughts, and it\u2019s a volatile combination.\n\nStill, it\u2019s almost like you aren\u2019t completely yourself. Part of you feels like you\u2019ve done something like this before, and that you always tried to stop it, but couldn\u2019t. There is a brief moment of clarity and then only overwhelming guilt followed by rage.\n\n\u201cWhy? This is what you wanted and I warned you of the consequences. You thought you were going to be different. YOU thought you were going to steal me away from Tanya! But YOU were wrong! They ALL were! I made sure of that!\u201d you exclaim and point your pistol at Vera.\n\nNow you\u2019ve completely lost it.\n\nA loud shot is heard, but it isn\u2019t from your pistol. It\u2019s from the musket of a Holgard watchman who overheard all the noise and came running. In typical Holgard Watch fashion he shot first and didn\u2019t even bother asking questions.\n\nYou fall to the ground a final time with a bloody hole in the side of your head.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Fulfill the request", "result": "Never let be said you won\u2019t honor a lady\u2019s request.\n\nYou put your hands around Vera\u2019s neck, but are very aware of not to actually choke her (Even if she is telling you to squeeze a little harder at times). As fucked up as Vera might be for requesting this, you\u2019re definitely thinking that you\u2019re probably worse since you\u2019re starting to enjoy this.\n\nYour thoughts even goes to a dark place during this and you partially struggle to keep in mind that you shouldn\u2019t actually be trying to strangle her to death.\n\nIn any case you and Vera continue your sexual activities and even though you\u2019re the weakly choking her a bit, you\u2019re the one that starts feeling delirious and out of breath.\n\nAt one point you actually blurt out:\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, you\u2019re breaking the fantasy.\u201d Vera replies.\n\u201cUm, I mean you dirty whore, you\u2019re fit only to be fucked and killed!\u201d\n\nWhile this seems to really do it for Vera, you still think this is a really bad idea considering that she may very well really die after all this.\n\nDoesn\u2019t stop you though and you continue until you (and her) are completely spent.\n\nAt which point you collapse nearly directly on top of her and lose consciousness right there in the alley.\n\nWhen you wake up you surprisingly find yourself back at headquarters in your bed. You feel very drained and thirsty. Reminds you of when you were with Tanya.\n\nYou look over to your right and nearly jump when you find Vera lying next to you just staring.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?! How did we get here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell after you collapsed, I paid some bums who apparently had been watching us the whole time to help me drag you to the nearest brothel, from there I found some of our people and they carried you the rest of the way here.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Now I have to worry about my reputation along with you as well.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly think some bums are going to be a concern, and so some of the gang carried you home, big deal. It\u2019s not like you got the shit kicked out of you. You just passed out from a mixture of alcohol and wild sex. In fact I went on about how you were giving it to me really good last night. If anything your reputation just increased a bit. Even better, because I wasn\u2019t even lying.\u201d Vera remarks and moves in to caress your body.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cAnd me what? Oh you still worried about the whole curse thing? Obviously I\u2019m still here and doing fine, so obviously your concern is misplaced. I told you that you\u2019ve probably been living like a monk for years for no reason and there is no curse. We could\u2019ve been having fun a long time ago, but better late than never right?\u201d\n\u201cVera, I told you, the curse doesn\u2019t work like that. You could die tomorrow or even a month from now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I could also die a year from now. You going to blame that on a so called curse as well? Shit happens. And that\u2019s exactly what happened to those girls. I mean none of the ones you told me about were exactly in the safest of positions. Whores, tavern wenches, one was another thief. I mean it\u2019s a cruel world and living in Holgard doesn\u2019t make it any easier. Just because they happened to die shortly after you fucked them, doesn\u2019t mean your dick is cursed.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t answer, but you don\u2019t look convinced.\n\n\u201cI mean I know you. You typically think things out before making any major decisions, surely you must have considered that this was just in your head and you weren\u2019t cursed?\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYeah I did. Several times in fact, but there were just too many coincidences for me to not come to the conclusion I did. Not to mention I still think about Tanya from time to time. I mean it\u2019s certainly not as strong as it once was, but she\u2019s still there. And if she\u2019s still in my head, what else was left behind?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell of course you\u2019re still going to think about her. From what I can tell, she had fucking demon powers that aided in fucking with your head. Not to mention it sounds like you had a genuine relationship with her. Those things mixed together are going to cause some lingering feelings. I mean shit, I remember this asshole boyfriend I had back when I was a teenager. He wasn\u2019t even a demon and he knew how to say all the right shit to me and I was fool enough to fall for it most of the time. And despite the fact he\u2019s no longer in my life, there\u2019s still a part of me that remembers the few really good times with him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\u201cGot himself killed by being a dumb ass during a robbery. I cried over him for days, and like I said sometimes I still even think about him but my point is I got over him and moved on. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re having a hard time doing. You got some sort of weird loyalty going on with this demon chick. Reminds me of those widows that wear black forever after their husbands die. Life\u2019s too damn short to live in the past, which is why I\u2019m not going to fucking worry about a curse and YOU shouldn\u2019t either. We should have gotten together a long time ago.\u201d\n\nYou know Vera made a brief argument last night about this. At the time you weren\u2019t really thinking straight to really take it into proper consideration and you half believed she just really wanted your dick. And while that still might be true, it doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t necessarily believe everything she\u2019s saying and is just hedging her bets that you aren\u2019t cursed, she must REALLY be into you if she\u2019s risking potential death.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but be pretty attracted to that sort of dedication. In fact, if you weren\u2019t still feeling so drained you\u2019d probably have with Vera again right now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I have been hanging on to a memory and making excuses. Time put everything from the past aside and see what happens.\u201d You reply.\n\nAfter getting something to drink, you muster up as much energy you can to get around to dictating orders for everyone today, though you end up letting Vera taking over those duties for the most part today while you\u2019re still recovering from yesterday. (Which she\u2019s happy to do)\n\nAs much as you\u2019re trying to put the past aside and focus on your new relationship with Vera which is seemingly going well, it\u2019s not entirely simple.\n\nFor whatever reason Tanya keeps popping up in your head. Actually more frequently that she has in quite awhile. Like when you weren\u2019t with anyone you only thought about her briefly once every month or so. Now? She\u2019s passing through your mind at least once a day. Sometimes more.\n\nYou continue to try to ignore it, but then your mind starts going to a darker place. You begin to see the images of the women you had sex with in the past after Tanya and their deaths. Honestly before recently when you started explaining all this Vera you hadn\u2019t given them much thought. You never actually saw them die when you were informed of their deaths, yet now you\u2019re seeing their deaths quite clearly, like you were actually there.\n\nWorse, now you\u2019re starting to visualize Vera\u2019s death and it all comes to a head when you have very real nightmare involving you stabbing her to death.\n\n\u201cArgh! Fuck!\u201d you exclaim waking up.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Vera says waking up next to you.\n\u201cOh shit. Thank the gods, you\u2019re still alive!\u201d you say and immediately hold her tight.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m still alive. Wait, have you still been worrying about that curse I told you was bullshit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, for awhile now. But I don\u2019t think its bullshit. For the past month I\u2019ve been having these really dark thoughts and I keep seeing the deaths of those girls and the worst part about all of that is I\u2019m starting to think that I killed them.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, you didn\u2019t. Those were all accidents or coincidences, not a fucking curse!\u201d\n\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying! I\u2019m saying, the girl that died in the fire? I SAW myself light the place up! The other that died of an overdose of Yellow Devil? I fucking injected her with it! And now I\u2019ve been seeing myself stab you to death! This is worse that I thought! Before I thought maybe it was just demonic forces doing their work independently, but now it\u2019s ME directly! I mean I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse, the fact that maybe there\u2019s a curse on me causing me to kill these women OR something is fucked up in my head and it\u2019s just been me the whole time! Either way, you\u2019re not safe around me!\u201d\n\nDespite this revelation and you being obviously upset, Vera is silent and doesn\u2019t move from her spot.\n\n\u201cOkay. We can still work through this.\u201d She replies calmly.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u201cFuck yes I\u2019m serious! As far as I know all couples have their issues, yours just happens to be more complicated. Okay first thing you need to do is go fuck some whores.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. I want you to go fuck a bunch of whores. Pick a brothel we own and fuck as many as you can. I mean I know you didn\u2019t do it before because you didn\u2019t want to put their lives in jeopardy and that\u2019s very sweet of you. One of your endearing qualities, but we need to see if any of this is true once and for all. Obviously if they start dying off then maybe this curse business has some merit and if it IS you doing it, then it\u2019s going to be really obvious soon enough. I mean maybe you\u2019ll get some of them, but no way in hell you\u2019re going to be able to kill them all without getting caught.\u201d\n\nThis is insane.\n\n\u201cBut, what if I target you first? I mean I\u2019m already thinking about it!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me. And if you try I think you know I can take care of myself. And even in the off chance you do, well then it\u2019s not going to matter because I\u2019ll be dead.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about me?! Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ll feel really bad about killing you?!\u201d\n\nVera touches your face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you will. You\u2019ll probably even cry over me for a while. The sadder thing is, it\u2019ll still be more emotion than anyone else has ever shown me. I told you I\u2019m in this for the long haul. So if that means you if I have to temporarily let you fuck other women and all this still possibly resulting in my death, then so fucking be it.\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s unbelievably fanatical devotion to you is really starting to reach a level that you didn\u2019t think was possible. Whatever \u201ccondition\u201d is fucking with your head, it\u2019s going to have a really difficult time in getting you to actually kill her\n\n\u201cNow you want me to go with you to the brothel? Will it help if I\u2019m there?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cUm, no. I\u2019ll go there by myself. Um, what if this all turns out to be true?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, then I guess you\u2019ll have to get the priests of Dorna to cure you. I know you said you declined before since it all felt a little sketchy and you didn\u2019t feel right about the ritual, but desperate times and all that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose it\u2019ll be the only way. Shit\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey, we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\nVera kisses you and you\u2019re soon on your way to one of the brothels.\n\nWhen you arrive, you\u2019re greeted warmly since it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve been to it and not just because you own the place.\n\nAnd so begins \u201cthe test.\u201d\n\nThe first time, it takes awhile for you to get into it mainly because now you feel like you\u2019re not just cheating on Tanya, but that you\u2019re also cheating on Vera!\n\nThen again, it\u2019s not cheating at all is it? Tanya isn\u2019t in the picture anymore and hasn\u2019t been for years and Vera gave you permission.\n\nOnce you settle that in your mind you\u2019re able to get on with it, with fewer issues. You still end up having some thoughts about those dead women, and even Vera and the whores you were with today. Except it wasn\u2019t quite as vivid.\n\nYou repeat the process and by the time a week passes you\u2019re experiencing the thoughts even less. Now Vera isn\u2019t even showing up. Oddly some of the whores still are, but again it\u2019s very minor. You aren\u2019t thinking about Tanya either.\n\nA month passes and you haven\u2019t had any dark thoughts and nothing has happened to any of the whores or Vera.\n\nThe dead women however are still with you. The images of you being there now feel more like a faint memory. You get the terrible feeling you DID kill them. You aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s due to a curse or some mental break down you had after the break up with Tanya, but they aren\u2019t going away. You\u2019re going to just have to try to rebury those thoughts again.\n\nVera\u2019s been pretty understanding through all this so that\u2019s certainly helping, but you\u2019re wondering if maybe it would help even more if you weren\u2019t in Holgard any longer.\n\n\u201cExpansion? Where?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cI dunno, but besides all the other shit going on in my head, I have been thinking about business matters too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, so were you thinking about starting a League chapter in the Delantium Kingdom?\n\u201cNo. For whatever reason the Ebony Claw Syndicate has not fucked with us. If we start going into their territory, that could change. Besides this this isn\u2019t really expansion so much as relocation. I really think for my own mental health I need a change of location. Too many fucked up memories and baggage here.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I see. Well you ever heard of Jicol?\u201d\n\u201cThink I\u2019ve heard some of the Hessla pirates we deal with mention it sometimes. Don\u2019t know much though.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a port town west of Hessla and from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s wide open like a whore\u2019s legs. Nobody has tried to organize anything there and the city focuses so much on defending against potential pirate attacks that it doesn\u2019t have the heightened security like say Klyton does in recent years. I say we start there.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so are we not keeping a presence at all here?\u201d\n\u201cI thought about it, but again, I don\u2019t want too many ties to this place. I mean I\u2019d keep Warts in charge of a chapter here, but I doubt that he\u2019ll want the headache of running it. I figure I\u2019ll just pass the businesses off to the next most qualified person who can start a new organization and we\u2019ll take the half of the treasury and whoever wants to come with us to relocate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if nobody comes?\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019ll still have the coin and we can still restart in Jicol with all new people. Or it can just end up being just us. I don\u2019t care. My mental well being and my relationship with you is more important than coin.\u201d\n\u201cMore important than coin? Wow, you really do care about me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do, why would you doubt that?\u201d\n\u201cWell I know how I feel, and I can make good guesses on your feelings, but it\u2019s never a sure thing you know? But I\u2019m happy to have confirmation. In any case, I go where you go. We\u2019ll start over in Jicol and be successful, in fact I\u2019ve already got my own ideas about what can get us a good head start\u2026\u201d\n\nWith Vera by your side, a new prospect on the horizon and your \u201ccondition\u201d either subdued or gone completely you\u2019re feeling more positive about the future.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 3D1: Nocturnal Ambitions\n\n\n\nYear 30\n\nProperly getting with Vera and relocating is the best decision you could have made you think. You definitely feel more at ease and not as stressed out all the time. And more importantly you\u2019ve finally shaken off the effects of whatever it was that was fucking with your head before.\n\nStill, there always problems that crop up in your line of work. Nothing that can be done to eliminate that.\n\n\u201cThese Black Hooks are dumb ass snot nosed kids.\u201d You say.\n\u201cPerhaps, but you know those type tend to be very eager to prove themselves.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019m just not sure I want that lot incorporated into our organization.\u201d\n\u201cWell the only other option is to wipe them out then, because I think you know from direct experience that two major criminal organizations in one city tends to lead to a whole lot of conflict.\u201d\n\u201cHah, I\u2019d hardly call the Black Hooks a major anything. They\u2019re a gang of wannabes, but I guess you do have a point and everyone does have to start somewhere. Yeah, probably should try to recruit them now when they\u2019re young and moldable. Might be good to have some more local people and bolster our ranks a bit more.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so how do you want to do this?\u201d\n\u201cTalk to the leader and his lieutenants I guess. Martin is his name?\u201d\n\u201cMarco actually.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever. Have some of our people go to one of their little hangouts to set up a meeting and explain to them if they don\u2019t accept the invitation then I\u2019ll have my answer of how to deal with them. Now are we certain that they are the only other organization in the city?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, all other criminal activity in the city is mostly by independents and unorganized.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well we probably should start gathering them too in time, but we\u2019ll deal with the Black Hooks first.\n\nVera kisses you goodbye to go perform her regular duties and get things rolling on the Black Hooks situation.\n\nA couple days pass and you\u2019ve finally gotten your answer from the Black Hooks and apparently despite some tough talk by Marco, he\u2019s agreed to meet with you, just outside the city.\n\nGiven what you know of him and the Black Hooks, they\u2019re a gang of youths that engage in a lot of petty crime such as punching old ladies and taking their coin bags. You\u2019re also aware that more than a few of them though are getting hooked on Purple Wish so that might play a part in negotiations. Though as far as you\u2019re concerned, this isn\u2019t going to be much of a negotiation, it\u2019s going to be you telling these wannabes if they want to be continue along their path of delinquency, they\u2019re going to have to start falling in line.\n\nYou naturally get to the meeting a little early and have some of your people hiding nearby in case something happens, but honestly you\u2019re not worried. Eventually Marco and three of his people of them arrive. Two of them look a little jittery. Another one is female and given that she\u2019s hanging on Marco\u2019s arm, it must be his little trashy girlfriend.\n\nMarco gives you the hard stare to which of course you\u2019re quite unimpressed by.\n\n\u201cI trust you know who I am.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, you run that new gang called the Nocturnal League.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re a lot more than just a gang.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, whatever. So we\u2019re here. What the fuck did you want to talk about?\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cHm, I\u2019ll ignore the bluster and chalk it up to nerves.\u201d\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not nervous! There\u2019s four of us out here and just one of you!\u201d Marco exclaims, not knowing just how close he is to death at anytime.\n\u201cRelax, it wasn\u2019t an insult, but tell me Marco, where do you see the Black Hooks in five years?\u201d\n\u201cFive years?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I said. Where do you see yourself and your gang in that time? What\u2019s the plan? Do you have a plan?\u201d\n\nMarco just looks at you and then at his buddies with a blank expression.\n\nPredictable. Stupid ass teenager doesn\u2019t have a plan.\n\n\u201cWell? Come on boy think! I know you lot engages in minor thievery and pointless vandalism. Were you planning on moving into drugs and whores? Get into the Qweepa fights perhaps? Unite all the criminals in the city into your little gang and take over all of Jicol\u2019s underworld?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUm? Um is not a plan you halfwit. Am I just wasting my time here?\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Fuck! I dunno! I mean I guess we want to be pirates.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\u201cOkay, you lot want to be pirates. Alright, do you own a ship?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no ship. Are you saving coin to buy one?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. Do you know how to sail?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell, do any of you losers at least KNOW any fucking pirates?\u201d\n\u201cI do!\u201d the girl says.\n\u201cHm, I bet you do.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHey what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Marco asks.\n\u201cIt means your little girlfriend is the only one here that at least has any connections, and since I\u2019m a gentleman I won\u2019t elaborate any further since it\u2019s none of my concern anyway. My point is you fuckers have no damn ambition. You lot probably haven\u2019t even left this island have you?\u201d\n\nThe four of them again look down and at each other.\n\n\u201cI thought so. When I was your age I had already killed several men, left home and was travelling the world!\u201d\n\nTravelling the world might be pushing it, but travelling to Holgard is still more than these little shits have done. At this point you begin lecturing Marco about how their criminal activity is petty and amateur along with bringing unnecessary heat down by the Jicol Watch.\n\nSomething about this seems familiar\u2026\n\n\u201cHey! Get off our fucking asses! What gives you the right to yell at us? You\u2019re not our fucking dad!\u201d\n\nAnd yep, that\u2019s what seemed familiar. Shit, you never thought you\u2019d sound like your father, but you guess the old man\u2019s personality is there after all. In any case, you hope you\u2019re a little more successful than he was in getting some unruly teenagers in line.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not your dad, but here\u2019s the thing, I AM in charge. From now on, the Nocturnal League is taking over everything and you can either be part of that, or you can get the hell out of the way. The choice is yours. What you don\u2019t want is to be IN our way. Now I\u2019m telling you lot this first because you\u2019re closest thing to an organization in this city so you\u2019re officially the biggest competition, as laughable as that is. You\u2019re also getting the chance to join a REAL one along with better training for all your youthful activity that the law disapproves of. So, you with me or not?\u201d\n\u201cSo what happens if I say no?\u201d Marco asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to leave. Though I\u2019d suggest that you go get a regular job like a barrel maker or go try to be a cabin boy on a pirate ship and pursue that dream because as I said, the Black Hooks as of now are a thing of the past.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSo we have no choice.\u201d\n\u201cSure you do, just not the one you want. Look, I get that this is going to be the hardest for you since you\u2019re in a leadership position and you probably don\u2019t like people telling you what to do and all I can say to that is well tough shit. You\u2019re either going to have to suck it up or as I said, get the hell out of my way. Now if it\u2019ll lessen the sting to your pride, I can say, you may retain some of your leadership role in a limited capacity. I\u2019m going to need help in assimilating the rest of your people and the smoother this goes down, the better off we\u2019ll ALL be.\u201d\n\nThis ultimatum is met with some silence and then the four of them begin whispering amongst themselves. It\u2019s actually sort of amusing to you.\n\nMarco turns to you and speaks.\n\n\u201cFuck you. We\u2019re not joining.\u201d Marco says.\n\nYou just sigh thinking that this was going so well too.\n\n\u201cOh? And that\u2019s what all of you have decided?\u201d you say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019VE decided.\u201d\n\u201cFunny, because I could have swore I saw you conversing with your friends which signifies to me that maybe you AREN\u2019T the leader you claim if you have to speak with anyone before making a final decision as important as this.\u201d\n\u201cI AM the leader and I\u2019m not following some asshole that\u2019s trying to scare me. I know some shit about you. You only just got here and only have a handful of people. The Black Hooks have WAY more than you. You don\u2019t look so tough and if you didn\u2019t have that pistol, I\u2019d kick your ass.\u201d\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d\n\nWell you expected some resistance, but you figured it would be half assed negotiation, not Marco finding the balls to stand up to you.\n\nThe simple thing would be to shoot him and get this over with since you\u2019re fairly sure the rest are going to fall in line, but you\u2019ll make greater point by actually humoring this asshole. Besides, he\u2019s annoyed you enough that you\u2019ll take some delight in kicking his ass.\n\n\u201cOkay then, but first.\u201d You say and whistle for your people to come out of hiding.\n\nMarco and his people look a little surprised which just proves how dumb they really are if they thought you were out here alone.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m fairly certain as soon as I\u2019m kicking Marco\u2019s ass, he\u2019s going to call for help, I want you two to make sure this is indeed a fair fight. Shoot anyone who interferes.\u201d\n\u201cWait, how do I know they won\u2019t shoot us, if I win?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t win.\u201d You say and hand your pistol over to one of your people.\n\nMarco pulls a knife and begins to look for an opening to which to attack. You just watch him.\n\n\u201cI want you three to pay attention, because what I do to Marco, I\u2019ll also do to you if you choose to follow him\u2026well not you. You can have a position in the brothel.\u201d You say to Marco\u2019s buddies.\n\nPredictably this enrages him and he swings wildly at you with his knife, you easily dodge his clumsy attacks and with a few punches to his face, he\u2019s already on the ground.\n\nYou then step on his wrist and take the knife from him.\n\n\u201cToo fucking easy.\u201d\n\nAt this point Marco attempts to punch you in the balls with his other hand, but instead you stomp him in the face. You then proceed to break his arm, he screams in pain and his girlfriend looks away while his buddies look like they\u2019ve just realized how serious this is.\n\nYou point Marco\u2019s own knife at his face and he\u2019s already crying and begging for his life.\n\n\u201cNo! (sob) Please! I don\u2019t wanna die! I apologize! I\u2026 (sob)\u201d Marco screams.\n\u201cShut up! Shut the fuck up. YOU brought this on yourself. Up until now, you\u2019ve just been playing, but this is what happens when you make bad fucking choices. There are consequences.\u201d you say as you prod the knife into his face so it bleeds.\n\n\u201cHowever, you\u2019re fortunate that today those consequences aren\u2019t fatal.\u201d\n\nYou stand up and step back while Marco\u2019s people slowly go see to him.\n\n\u201cYou change your mind?\u201d\n\nMarco of course says he does and his people do as well.\n\n\u201cGood, now go back and tell the rest of your gang about the change in leadership. Also assure them that they all stand to make more coin and who knows maybe you lot will actually scrape enough to buy a ship one day. In the meantime Marco, I\u2019m going to be counting on you to make this transition smooth. I don\u2019t want to have to straighten out the rest of your gang the way I had to with you, I don\u2019t have the fucking time. Understand?\u201d\n\nMarco nods his head and thanks you for not killing him.\n\n\u201cYes, well I am the nice one. Now get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nMarco and his crew leave as quick as they can and head back to Jicol. After chuckling a bit with your own people and taking your pistol back, you do start to do likewise.\n\nOr at least you try to.\n\nYou\u2019re not used to stomping about the jungle area outside Jicol and unfortunately you end up getting turned around and lost.\n\nYou begin cursing as your two underlings try not to anger you any further by staying silent. As you\u2019re still wandering through the jungle you stumble upon a ruined structure. Looks like a temple and by its design it looks like one dedicated to Fel.\n\nSeeing as it\u2019s starting to get dark, you half wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just take shelter in here for the night and start fresh tomorrow.

Hell, she might have even declared war on the Black Hooks believing them to have killed you, but there isn\u2019t much you can do about that at the moment.\n\nYou tell your two people you\u2019re going to take shelter in the temple and you all head inside.\n\nAfter lighting a couple torches, you get a better look at your surroundings and the place looks about like what you\u2019d expect, though it\u2019s obviously much bigger than the temple in Holgard. It\u2019s also covered in spiderwebs.\n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, but you think about the possibility of some valuable items still here. Temples usually have that sort of thing lying around. You might as well take a look given that you\u2019ll be spending the night here.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a look around. Grab anything that looks like it might have some value.\u201d You say.\n\nYou all search the immediate nearby rooms and areas, but don\u2019t find much save for a lot more cobwebs. You enter one room, you find a couple of old vases that look like they might hold value. As you\u2019re looking at those, one of your people ends up finding a stairway leading down.\n\n\u201cHey boss. Found something.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I suppose if there is anything of value, it might be down there. Of course who knows what might be down there, so we should be careful. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were traps.\u201d\n\nYou and your two people slowly head down the steps, when suddenly you start to hear squeaking. At first you think it might be rats, but the squeak is a bit of a lower tone.\n\nYou soon see several sources of the squeaking running at you from the darkness of the bottom of the stairwell.\n\n\u201cShit, there\u2019s a fucking shitload of qweepas!\u201d\n\nYour underling instinctively starts swinging his torch at them, but qweepas tend to be a bit more fearless than normal rats especially in a large pack like this and merely just avoid the flames by running around his swing radius. Doesn\u2019t take long before one of them has managed to get to his legs and bite him. He shouts in pain and slips down the stairs.\n\nWhile this wasn\u2019t enough to kill him, the old traps that were at the bottom of said stairs well and you see a swinging spike impaling him.\n\nMeanwhile there are more qweepas coming up from the stairs. A lot of them. You and your other underling immediately run back up the stairs, while qweepas are biting at your heels the whole time. Some of them are even managing to leap on your back.\n\nYou both get to the top of the stairs and have to stop to get the damn things off of you before they gnaw through your clothes and your body. You start stabbing, burning and throwing the oversized rats against the walls. You\u2019ve got bites all over you and you\u2019re bleeding all over, but that\u2019s nothing compared to your surviving underling who isn\u2019t quite so lucky when a qweepa manages to bite into his neck, puncturing an artery.\n\nFlailing and crying out, he falls to the floor mobbed by several qweepas who are eager to finish him off.\n\nYou manage to get away, but the qweepas haven\u2019t given up yet. You end up getting a couple more leaping on you, which causes you to have to slow down your pace again to get them off. In the process, you drop your torch and fumble around in a corridor desperately trying to avoid an ignoble fate of getting eaten by these things.\n\nAs you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019ve moved far enough away from your dropped light source that you can\u2019t even see what\u2019s around you clearly. In your thrashing you\u2019ve stumbled down a corridor you didn\u2019t explore and specifically into a larger gathering of spiderwebs.\n\nYou were pretty careful about avoiding those before and burning the smaller patches that were in your way earlier, but now you\u2019ve fallen into right into one big patch. The webbing is incredibly sticky, and now you\u2019re having a hard time even moving at all.\n\nDespite this impediment, you manage to get rid of the last of the qweepas, and fortunately for you, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any more qweepas attacking you.\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s because even most qweepas know better than to go near the spider webs.\n\nAs you\u2019re trying to pull yourself free, you soon find out that these webs weren\u2019t just made by multitudes of little spiders, or even several big ones.\n\nA vibration on the web is felt as you\u2019re still fumbling around in the dark and you look just in time to see a very large mass descend upon you. You can\u2019t see it clearly, but fear over takes you since you know what it could only be.\n\nAnd much like spiders of the smaller variety, it injects a poison, which paralyzes you, but it doesn\u2019t bother wrapping you up and save you for later.

She nearly called the rest of the League to go attack the Black Hooks. You explain everything.\n\n\u201cYou let him live? You sure he\u2019s not going to try to get revenge someday?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cHe might, but I\u2019m not particularly worried that he will. Right now he\u2019s got proper fear in him and he\u2019ll get the rest of the Black Hooks in line with the League. They\u2019ve been following him this long so they\u2019ll listen and in time his influence will be less as we split them up and have them work with other people.

Of course there\u2019s a lot of training involved, but thankfully many of them are quick learners after all. It\u2019s also one of the major competitors out of the way and when you get better consolidated you\u2019ll be able to move on to the independent folks as well.\n\nYou\u2019ll soon have this city\u2019s entire underworld under the Nocturnal League\u2019s control at this pace.\n\nYear 31\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, I thought nobody else here was organized!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t, but I guess when word got around about what happened with the Black Hooks, the independents formed a loose alliance. They call themselves the Jicol Coalition of Rogues.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t actually believe they\u2019ll win.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe not, but I believe that they at least think they\u2019ll make things harder. Maybe even to the point that you\u2019ll give up.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cWell that means war then, but I have to remind you, we can\u2019t just start stabbing people in the streets. The Jicol Watch isn\u2019t as corrupt as the Holgard Watch was, in fact they\u2019ve been starting to become a pain in the ass and I\u2019m getting concerned that they\u2019re going to actually raid our headquarters one day.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s been a concern of mine too. Now that the League is bigger, we\u2019re probably attracting a lot more attention.\n\u201cMaybe we need to relocate.\u201d\n\u201cWell we could do that, but the city is only so big. Eventually we\u2019ll have to relocate again. (Sigh) One of the things I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d miss is the spacious sewers of Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you saw a structure outside the city, in the jungle?\u201d\n\u201cYes after meeting with Marco, when I got lost I found that ruined temple. We didn\u2019t explore it really though. Actually always meant to go back to give it a proper look though. I believe it was dedicated to Fel.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well I was going to suggest that we make our base there. I mean regardless of what they do in the city, the Jicol Watch are definitely not going to harass us out there, but I\u2019m not sure if I want to do that if it was a temple dedicated to Fel.\u201d\n\u201cHm, that\u2019s not a bad idea though. I mean it might it be a bit of a trip and take some work in cleaning up, but having something defensible like that would be a lot better than the current tavern front we\u2019re operating out of.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds fairly labor intensive, not to mention dangerous and I\u2019m still leery about making Fel Temple our base. I was part of the Syndicate and saw some of the shit Rook could do with Fel\u2019s divine power. I wouldn\u2019t want to piss off a god.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve seen shadow magic as well by EC members and the actual priests, but honestly, I\u2019m more concerned with more corporal trouble than divine right now.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I suppose it\u2019s up to you and I\u2019ll support your decision, but I feel like this is also going to take time away from combating the JCR.\u201d\n\nFor all the issues with this, you\u2019re convinced that this is going to be better in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking that temple and as for the JCR, there hasn\u2019t been any real aggression yet. I mean from what you\u2019ve said, they aren\u2019t really united except in defense against assimilation. Unless they attack, we\u2019ll hold off for now, and perhaps in time, we can lure some over without the need for combat. There will be a day of reckoning though.\u201d\n\nThe month clearing out the ruined temple is a grueling process. It fortunately isn\u2019t inhabited by anything worse than some over sized spiders and a shitload of qweepas. You mostly use the ex-Black Hooks to do a lot of the grunt work, even if they grumble a lot. Marco\u2019s keeps the louder ones in line, but eventually even he has to complain when it turns out there are a lot of traps in the lower passages of the temple that have killed a few of them.\n\nAfter a bit of going back and forth of explaining that disarming traps is part of their training, you ultimately give them a break by stepping in and helping out directly.\n\nWhen you get down to the lower passages, you can sort of see their complaints, considering it\u2019s like a maze down here. You nearly trip some of the traps yourself, but thanks to your years of skill, you avoid any injury (and impress some of these ex-Hooks all the more)\n\nWhat is more interesting to you however is when you stumble upon rooms still filled with a few objects. Mostly vases and such, but you do find some more valuable items as well. Soon you\u2019ve got a bunch of teenagers arguing over treasure and you have to remind them\u2026\n\n\u201cNot sure what you lot are arguing about, all this shit is going to me first, especially since I was the one who disarmed most of these traps in the first place. In any event we can probably get a good price for most of this stuff and the League could always use more coin in the general treasury.\u201d You say.\n\nAt this point you tell everyone that they can finally head back to the city to return to their former duties, which they seem relieved about.\n\nYou spend the next day just you by yourself in your new future headquarters as you go through the various valuable objects trying to appraise how much you should be able to get for them.\n\nAs you\u2019re putting a vase aside, you suddenly hear something and you draw your pistol.\n\n\u201cBefore you start shooting, it\u2019s just me. I see I came just in time to see you giving the children a break.\u201d Vera says slowly entering the room.\n\u201cVera? Didn\u2019t expect you to come here so soon.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, well I figured I needed to get over my fears if this is going to be our new headquarters. I have to say, it is a lot better than that front we\u2019re currently using. I still have my concerns though. Are you really sure we\u2019re not pissing off some divine being doing this?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, but I\u2019m guessing if Fel really didn\u2019t like it, he would have already killed all of us with shadow monsters by now.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily, he could just do it over time. He is a god after all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I remember something you said. We could all die randomly at anytime, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s any curse or greater reason behind it. Just means shit happens.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. Still, if we do start seeing shadow monsters, I think we should just get the hell off the island and not look back.\u201d\n\u201cWorks for me. So any information of what\u2019s going on with this new coalition of independent rogues? Like maybe who the leader is?\n\u201cNothing new. Still can\u2019t figure out who is the leader yet. Then again it\u2019s supposed to be a defensive alliance against us, not a proper organization.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and that\u2019s bullshit. The Thieves\u2019 Guild was supposed to be a so called alliance of independent rogues as well and they definitely had a leader. Someone always has to be calling the shots at the top of the pyramid. The fact that we haven\u2019t found this person yet indicates to me that they got much more in mind than simple defense. My other concern is the Jicol Watch. While this temple will keep us from getting completely fucked over if they ever come down hard on us, it still doesn\u2019t change that all of our businesses could still be fucked in the city.\u201d\n\nVera starts to speak and then stops.\n\n\u201cSeems like you have something to say. Out with it, I think we\u2019ve gotten to a place in our relationship where we can talk about anything now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I was just thinking, I over heard some of the Black Hooks saying once that there was an abandoned dock not far from this temple that nobody uses anymore. We could probably fix it up. Strong arm some carpenters and wood workers to do it and get some of our people to do any extra needed labor.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cHmmm, I see where you\u2019re going with this. You\u2019re saying we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on Jicol\u2019s docks to trade with pirates, smugglers and some corrupt merchants if shit really went bad for us. Good idea, but I can\u2019t imagine the government is going to just let us get away doing that.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jicol\u2019s government is fairly hands off at times. Considering they let pirates dock in the city as long as they aren\u2019t pillaging or causing trouble, they probably aren\u2019t going to care about what we\u2019re doing out here. I mean that\u2019s why we\u2019re setting up a base out here right? In fact, I\u2019d say they\u2019d probably prefer it if those type came over here instead. In time we could probably build up a small trading outpost and move some of our businesses out of Jicol entirely.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re talking about building a city.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe nothing so grand as a city, but something like a smaller version of Hessla except with us in charge.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea, but this all seems pretty damn expensive and keep in mind we still don\u2019t even have control over all the criminal activity here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I was thinking about other potential avenues of revenue too and while I know you were against it before, I REALLY think we should go into it now\u2026\u201d\n\nYou already know what Vera is suggesting.\n\n\u201cSlave trade.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLook, I know how you feel about this and back in Holgard it didn\u2019t matter as much since it was a bigger city with more options, but here? We\u2019re in a perfect position to take advantage of the thriving slave trade in this area.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cThriving slave trade? As far as I know there aren\u2019t any slave rings in Jicol.\u201d\n\u201cExactly! There has never been enough organization to do it right here. We could set up shop and as I said, slaver and pirate ships come here all the time for supplies or rest and he Jicol government doesn\u2019t give a shit as long as they aren\u2019t trying to pillage the place. If we have our own dock, we could easily start selling slaves without even the hassle of potentially getting shit from the Jicol government.\u201d\n\u201cSo where are we getting these slaves again?\u201d\n\u201cWell we are at war with the independents right? I figure we can start with them. We got this big new base now, plenty of places to keep them in chains.\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s suggestion solves a few issues you suppose.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s due to recently discovering that you murdered several innocent women and blacked it out that\u2019s changed things, but for whatever reason engaging in slave trade just doesn\u2019t seem to repulse you so much anymore.\n\nIf word gets out that you\u2019re selling your enemies into slavery that could scare a lot of folks into joining. Getting killed is one thing, but getting turned into a slave might be enough to give some people pause.\n\n\u201cOkay Vera, I can see some advantages for us going into this business and since you\u2019ve got all the expertise, I\u2019m going to hand this task for you to oversee.\u201d you say.\n\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll start letting my pirate contacts know that we\u2019re in the slave trade business. Word will spread and I can\u2019t wait to get started!\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I guess we better get started on getting all this up and running. I guess I should ask though, what is it with you and the slave trade anyway? Not that I would ever profess to be a Jochim saint, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m going to necessarily enjoy this.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I guess because when I did it before I was really good at it.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re good at a lot of other things too, but you\u2019re not volunteering for a position at a whore house.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. Fortunately for you, I enjoy doing that for free.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, not that free. I\u2019m paying half of everything everyday.\u201d\n\u201cBest coin you\u2019ll ever spend. Anyway as I was saying, I wasn\u2019t just good, I dare say I was damn near the best. I could talk of some of those so called master slavers from Hessla into a deal in my favor. Always felt a great sense of accomplishment when I took advantage of one of those fat bastards. I think I never got a chance to truly shine though because Elias was a controlling asshole, but with you I know this will be different. Everything is different now that we\u2019re finally together.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Vera hugs and kisses you lovingly, which then leads to sex. You can\u2019t help but think that the whole slave trade subject must turn her on in some way which is another reason for her enthusiasm, but it\u2019s hardly surprising given what you know about her. Vera\u2019s got some fucked up sexual quirks.\n\nYou really know how to pick \u2018em. You went from a demonkin who tried to turn you away at every opportunity to a woman who practically adores you so much that she gets off on you \u201craping\u201d her.\n\nMaybe you just weren\u2019t meant to have an average girlfriend, let alone an average relationship. Makes sense given that you don\u2019t lead an average life either.\n\nHowever that magical moment of passion in the ruins of a structure dedicated to a deity of shadows, leads to a very average outcome.\n\nSoon\u2026\n\n\u201cWHAT?! How the hell did that happen?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cThe usual way I suspect.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cI know that, I just mean\u2026I thought you couldn\u2019t get pregnant! Something about your lady innards being barren.\u201d\n\u201cWell I thought so to, I mean I\u2019ve had sex tons of other times with other guys before you and then we\u2019ve had it a lot when we got together and nothing. I can\u2019t imagine what changed.\u201d\n\u201cWell I mean are you sure? I mean your belly isn\u2019t big.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still too early for me to start looking like an ogre after feeding time at the halfling trough, but I have been feeling nauseous and peeing a lot more. Also my tits feel tender sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWell that explains why you bitched at me so much when went up and suddenly squeezed them a couple days ago.\u201d\n\u201cI mean just to be really sure I actually saw a physician in Jicol and he pretty much confirmed it.\u201d\n\u201cShit, well how much does he charge to solve the problem?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! I don\u2019t want to get rid of it!\u201d\n\u201cWhat seriously? You want to keep it?\u201d\n\u201cWell I admit, I never really saw myself as a mother, but I mean\u2026I dunno\u2026we already got roots in place, we might well have a family.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but what about the slave trade? You said you were going to be in charge of that!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I still will be. Nothing\u2019s changed on that front. I\u2019ll just have a midwife or some shit nearby. Y\u2019know I think one our people has some experience in that matter. Apparently she was the oldest of fifteen siblings and had to help deliver most of them. Can you imagine? I\u2019m telling you right now, we are NOT having fourteen more of these fuckers.\u201d\n\nRight now you\u2019re having difficulty even imagining having one! Your mind is going all over the place and you\u2019re having a hard time coming to grips with this. You certainly never saw yourself as a father. Should you even be bringing up a kid in this sort of life?\n\nWhile being a criminal and having a family isn\u2019t something new, it rarely works out well as enemies see it as an added potential weakness to pounce on.\n\nVera can see you\u2019re having some problems with this and tries to calm you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay you know. I mean so far we\u2019ve been making a lot of progress with little resistance so far. I mean I know there is the Jicol Coalition of Rogues that needs to be dealt with, but there are already whispers of some of them about to jump ship. If you\u2019re worried about me, don\u2019t be. I\u2019ll be fine to do my job. If anything I\u2019ll be safer by being closer to our headquarters since the slave shit is going to just be run from here directly and to the rebuilt docks. I won\u2019t even have to travel to Jicol.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after I actually have the baby? Again, it\u2019s not going to be a problem. Even if we\u2019re in the middle of a gang war, I\u2019ll strap the little bugger on my back and fight off potential assassins if I have to. My point is, I\u2019m in this with you all the way. Motherhood isn\u2019t going to change me drastically.\u201d\n\nWell even if you were going to try to talk Vera out of this, you doubt if you\u2019d succeed or at least you doubt you\u2019d succeed without a lot of drama which might very well result in something pretty devastating for everyone.\n\nNot that you were going to though since Vera\u2019s words have convinced you that everything will indeed be fine, or at least manageable. You aren\u2019t sure what sort of father you\u2019re going to make, but you suppose you\u2019ll find out.\n\nYou end the conversation on a positive note of looking forward to this unexpected upcoming event. You suppose since Vera\u2019s going to need extra help, you have more of the ex-Black Hooks help her with getting the docks fixed and ready and tell some of your old veterans to start capturing these Coalition fuckers and bringing them back to the temple in chains.\n\nYou also tell them that if the opportunity presents itself and it isn\u2019t going to cause a lot of problems, to capture a few pretty ladies as well. You may not be the smooth talker or have the expertise that Vera has, but you know pretty females are always in demand somewhere and they should give Vera a good start on this venture.\n\nAll this dwelling on you starting a new family makes you think about your pre-existing one and how they\u2019re all doing.\n\nIt\u2019s strange you suppose, but you get the urge to write to your parents. You don\u2019t give them all the details, but you tell them that you\u2019re doing okay and that you\u2019re finally \u201csettling down\u201d with a family of your own. You also apologize for how events unfolded that caused you to leave in the first place and that you know that they both tried to raise you the best they could and were lucky to have them for parents.\n\nYou finish the letter by telling them you love them and if they see sis, that you love her too.\n\nYou send the letter off and have no idea if it\u2019ll ever actually reach them and even if it does, you probably won\u2019t ever get an answer back, but you feel better about making the attempt.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re heading out to finish these assholes for good. You stay here and keep things running here as you do.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh sure, keep me at home, to look after the kids while you go out and have fun.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s important that you know your place as a woman. Speaking of kids, where\u2019s Kol?\u201d\n\u201cGertrude is currently looking after him.\u201d\n\u201cI swear I don\u2019t really like you leaving our son with her.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine and she\u2019s been nothing but helpful. I mean hell, she\u2019s probably one of the few people I\u2019d trust with him.\u201d\n\u201cDangerous to go around trusting the lot we associate with, but something about her bothers me.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know who the hell she was until she was promoted to midwife and babysitter. Which is amazing since she\u2019s one of our older members that stuck with us since Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, if you trust her then I guess that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, probably not, but I don\u2019t have time to worry about it right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you even going on this task? You said you had people in Jicol located at the docks to make sure he didn\u2019t try to get away and there are more than enough people to attack where the JCR are making their headquarters.\u201d\n\u201cI want to make sure everything goes right. I can\u2019t just sit around barking orders while getting old and fat. That\u2019s how crime bosses assassinated. I need to keep in practice and my skills sharp.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I suppose that makes sense, but I\u2019d say you\u2019re not really in any danger of being perceived as weak by any of our underlings right now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I intend to keep it that way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer it if you took less risks, besides if anyone was going to challenge your position you\u2019d be dead before you even knew what was going on since I\u2019d just poison your food and the shit would be over with.\u201d\n\u201cPoison? Really? I would have thought if it was going to be you, you\u2019d probably stab me while in the middle of sex.\u201d\n\u201cMm, too risky. Besides, that would just be foreplay not murder.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s not do that either.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so reserved. But if you\u2019re really insisting on going, be careful and don\u2019t lead the charge.\u201d\n\nVera has been overly concerned with your safety ever since she had Kol. You suppose you get why she is now due to you being the father of her child and all, but sometimes it\u2019s a bit too much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Vera, stop fussing!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re not also going out of revenge?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cRevenge?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Revenge tends make people a little reckless and I mean this has been sort of personal since you learned who the leader of JCR is.\u201d\n\u201cMm, I mean it certainly was unexpected when I found out. Perhaps less unexpected when he wouldn\u2019t even hear me out, but I can\u2019t say this is out of revenge. I imagine he would be more motivated by revenge than I would, hence why he stuck around to fight. I\u2019d say if anything I\u2019m more motivated by tying up an old loose end that doesn\u2019t come back to bite us in the ass in the future.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense. Okay then, apologies for my fussing as you put it..\u201d\n\nYou kiss Vera goodbye and say one more thing before leaving.\n\n\u201cGotta say though when Sneaks ran away all those years ago, I never expected it was to Jicol.\u201d\n\nYou head to Jicol to go meet Marco and the rest. Along the way you think about how history is sort of repeating itself here. A larger criminal organization crushing a smaller one. The only difference is you\u2019re the leader of the larger one this time.\n\nYou have to wonder why Sneaks didn\u2019t just take off like he did last time. Unless he really is that pissed at you, which you assume he is, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have bothered with all this and you would have easily taken over long before now.\n\nWhen you get to the simple home that the JCR was using as a main headquarters, you find that your people are currently arguing with some of the Jicol Watch. Great.\n\n\u201cKeep talking to me like that you little shit, and I\u2019ll just run all of your assess in. I still remember you and your gang of hooligans breaking several windows and punching old people in the face a couple years ago!\u201d one of the guards says.\n\u201cYeah well things are different now and YOU don\u2019t tell us what to do anymore!\u201d Marco exclaims.\n\nYou smack Marco upside the head when you arrive.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I do. Now shut the fuck up Marco, and what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe problem is, your little crime war was supposed to be kept to a dull fucking roar and for the past couple months you lot have been murdering each other in the streets and scaring the shit out of the civvies! You also got gangs of thugs like these loitering around. Now I know we have an agreement that will keep most of the scum out of this city for good, but the mayor is getting very weary of this conflict and is wondering if he shouldn\u2019t just have all parties involved executed.\u201d The watchman captain says.\n\u201cThe same mayor that allows pirates and the like to use his docks? Please, the mayor is no fucking Joachimite saint. We moved all of our shit out of Jicol and now we\u2019re doing the job that YOU lot couldn\u2019t. We\u2019re almost done with finishing off these assholes, we just need to clean out this place and get their leader.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re here to see it gets done thoroughly because this needs to be finished TODAY.\u201d\n\nThe watchman captain at this point signals to his platoon that all draw their weapons and then turns back to you as if daring you to argue.\n\n\u201cFine. If you want to help, I\u2019m not going to stop you, but stay out of our way.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t worry about that, because you lot will be taking the lead anyway. Not about to have you bunch sneaking about behind us.\u201d\n\nMarco starts to say something, but you stop him.\n\n\u201cBut boss\u2026\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cShut up Marco. Alright, let\u2019s finish these fuckers for good.\u201d You say to your people and motion to enter the place.\n\nNo sooner has one of your people stepped into the front door and they nearly get beheaded by a swinging axe trap. Unfortunately, they still get skewered by the spear trap when they ducked and dodged to the left.\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake people, this place is going to have traps up the ass, keep alert!\u201d you shout.\n\nFor at least the next hour, you search the house disarming traps and uncovering secret doors. You don\u2019t find anyone though. Meanwhile the Jicol Watch is still standing in the front room getting impatient.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d the captain remarks.\n\u201cWell what?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cI thought you said the leader was here and so far this place is empty.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I imagine there\u2019s a hidden trapdoor that we haven\u2019t uncovered yet. They\u2019re probably either hiding underground, or maybe even escaped through a tunnel.\u201d\n\u201cUnderground tunnel? There isn\u2019t much they could dig without risking hitting water and flooding said tunnels. In case you didn\u2019t realize, we\u2019re on a fucking island.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware, but that doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t do it. Besides all that, the leader has experience with underground dwellings that are half submerged in water.\u201d\n\nBefore you can have any further discussion, Marco comes back to you.\n\n\u201cHey boss, we found a trapdoor, looks like it goes down into a cellar. Um, we also lost Orin. Got a bunch of spikes in the face when he opened the trap door.\u201d\n\u201cIdiot. Anyway, see? I told you there was going to be a trapdoor.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, well you\u2019re still leading the way.\u201d The Watchman captain says.\n\nAfter a few more of your people check out the immediate room below, you descend down the ladder. You give a quick look and see that this room wasn\u2019t dug out recently. It was actually part of the original house since it actually has solid walls and a solid floor.\n\nHowever, to your left, is where you start to see the construction. You examine the entrance of the dug out tunnel in an attempt to detect any traps but find nothing.\n\nYour people go a little further and soon discover that there are tunnels going in several different directions.\n\n\u201cWell, have to hand it to you Sneaks, you didn\u2019t just sit on your hands. You literally dug in deep to make it difficult to root the last of you fuckers out.\u201d You think to yourself.\n\nGiven the extensive amount of tunnels, you\u2019re actually surprised he didn\u2019t end up flooding Jicol with a misplaced dig like the Watchman captain was talking about.\n\nYou briefly go down one of the tunnels and soon find that you\u2019re ankle deep in water.\n\nThis is going to be a mess hunting Sneaks and whoever else down here. In fact, you\u2019re starting to wonder if Vera was right and you shouldn\u2019t even bother being here. Especially with the Jicol Watch being involved as well.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave", "result": "Yeah, fuck this. You start walking down these tunnels and who knows what the hell is in store for you. For all you know Sneaks has traps set to collapse the damn things.\n\n\u201cMarco, we\u2019re getting the hell out of here. We\u2019re also getting all of our people that we got posted at the docks, I got a better idea.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat about this Sneaks asshole?\u201d Marco asks.\n\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t forgotten about him, but running through this little rat maze he\u2019s created isn\u2019t in my game plan. The JRC at this point is dead and he\u2019s not going to resurrect it in any capacity. Even if he tries, the Jicol Watch is so fed up with all of us, they\u2019ll crack down hard on them and we won\u2019t have to do shit. No, Sneaks is going to either try to escape off the island OR possibly try to assassinate me eventually. If it\u2019s the first one, I have a better idea of how to prevent that. If it\u2019s the second, he better hope he gets it right.\u201d\n\nYou and your people turn back and proceed to climb back up to the ground floor where the Jicol Watchmen are still milling about.\n\n\u201cWhat are you lot doing? Don\u2019t tell me you finished them off already.\u201d The Watchman captain remarks.\n\u201cNo, but I doubt that they\u2019re going very far. We\u2019ll get the rest of them later.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWhat?! Maybe we weren\u2019t clear, but this shit is ending TODAY.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well you lot go down there and end it today then. Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here? I never said I was going to stand in your way.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to leave, but the captain stands in your way. It\u2019s obvious now that there were other plans in play here.\n\n\u201cOkay, I see and I get it. You saw an opportunity and you were going to take advantage. Well, that opportunity is gone now, and there are enough of us to make this a problematic fight. Killing me won\u2019t bring down the Nocturnal League anyway. My wife is more than able to handle the leadership position and she\u2019s not going to spare any expense in getting revenge. Not to mention, regardless of the outcome, I am more than fast enough to take YOU out. You sure you want to do this?\u201d\n\nThe captain thinks about going for his own flintlock, while you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll take him and at least a couple of his people out before you get mobbed. If you\u2019re lucky, your people will move in quick enough that you\u2019ll be able to fight your way through the chaos and run your ass out of Jicol. It\u2019s not the best odds, but you\u2019ve been in worse situations.\n\nHowever, the captain isn\u2019t exactly eager to risk his own life this day.\n\n\u201cGet your people out of this city and back to that fucking broken down temple in the jungle you call home. I never want to see you or your kind in this city again. If I do, you\u2019ll be executed on sight. The Nocturnal League and whatever other gang of criminal cutthroats that tries to form in Jicol are through here. Understand?\u201d the captain warns.\n\u201cSure. You have your clean law abiding city and that will always be he case. No need to ever worry about the likes of us again.\u201d You say sarcastically.\n\nAt this point the captain and his people let you pass and you immediately tell Marco and the rest to go contact your other League members milling about at the Jicol docks to go back home. Meanwhile you\u2019ll going to speak to some of the pirate contacts you have that might be currently in port.\n\nNot long after you conclude your last remaining business in Jicol, an explosion is heard followed by a loud rumble. Sounds like it\u2019s coming from the direction you just came from.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before people are running and screaming about the city sinking since whatever happened, the streets are being filled with water. You can probably guess what happened though. The Jicol Watch went ahead and fumbled down in Sneaks\u2019 rat maze and probably triggered a trap, which collapsed the tunnels just like you figured they would.\n\nIt probably also caused enough water to flood everything and rise high enough to start flooding the nearby area as well.\n\nWhile it probably isn\u2019t going to cause the city to sink like how everyone is currently shouting and panicking about, it\u2019s certainly going be a lot of damage to repair.\n\nAlso a big positive is the fact that in times of disasters, crime usually goes up. You imagine that some of the Jicol Watch is now down quite a few people too, so you predict that the League\u2019s forays into Jicol will still go relatively unscathed as long as you keep a low profile.\n\nWhen you get back home, you explain what happened, though Vera is just pleased to see you and says she\u2019s doesn\u2019t know why she worried in the first place.\n\n\u201cWell, your words did help rein me in a bit. You were right, no need to take unnecessary chances if I don\u2019t need to, hence why I just left.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGlad to hear it, but what about Sneaks? You think he\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\u201cOh I imagine he had an escape plan in all this. We\u2019ll catch up to him again sooner or later, I\u2019m not worried. I made preparations.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, if you say it\u2019s handled then I guess it is.\u201d\n\nTwo months later...\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in there boss. Hasn\u2019t been too roughed up, like you said.\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cOkay, good.\u201d You say and then enter the room.\n\nUpon entering you see an old defeated looking man in a chair, though not completely broken. Sneaks looks at you without hate, but more with an attitude of \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with already.\u201d However, you\u2019re not quite done yet.\n\n\u201cI was starting to wonder when you\u2019d ever try to get off the island. There was a bet going on that you would come here to try to assassinate me, but I always knew you\u2019d try to run. It was the smartest play after what happened of course. What took you so long?\u201d\n\u201cWell if you hadn\u2019t noticed. I\u2019m not just a wanted criminal for being the ex-leader of the JRC, but also for causing severe destruction to Jicol. Was a little difficult raising the coin to bribe my way onto a merchant ship since I knew you probably had all your pirate and smuggler buddies on the look out for me. Even trying to sneak aboard a ship was impossible. Maybe if I had been younger\u2026fucking old age.\u201d\n\u201cYeah it sucks.\u201d\n\u201cI should have known that you had connections everywhere, but I couldn\u2019t scrounge a damn living in the half drowned remnants of Jicol anymore. So I took a risk and got captured by a opportunistic merchant rather than a pirate or slaver, the result is the same I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cIf you had been smart, you would have left long before this even happened rather than forming the JRC in the first place. Shit, I didn\u2019t even know you were here until that happened. Why\u2019d you bother? You usually always played things smart. Did revenge cloud your judgment?\u201d\n\u201cThat was part of it I suppose. Imagine my surprise that I found out it was you of all people starting up a new organization here. All my old thoughts of remembering how you and Tanya betrayed all of us\u2026well that made me feel like something needed to be done to stop you. If you had just been some random asshole, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I should be flattered.\u201d\n\u201cI also really thought we could win. Wasn\u2019t like you were the ECS after all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but you\u2019re forgetting that I also brought down the ECS in Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cSo I heard. I gotta admit, when I first met you, I thought you might go far in this profession\u2026but I didn\u2019t see you quite as ruthless as all this. I mean maybe you aren\u2019t ECS, but you\u2019re sure copying their rulebook. What exactly did we DO to you anyway? Weren\u2019t we always good to you in the Guild? I mean I know Garrick was an asshole to you about Tanya but was betrayal really necessary? Couldn\u2019t you just let her go?\u201d\n\u201cAt the time, I couldn\u2019t. Tried. Couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSo basically Tanya is your excuse for your actions?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Tanya\u2019s in the past. Has been for a long time. She left me long ago to seek her destiny in hell. This, is all me, though perhaps I am being influenced by another woman in my life, but then I have a son with her, so you could say I\u2019m securing a future with my family.\u201d\n\u201cWell it certainly is a legacy to be proud of. Slave trading \u2026even that\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t have thought you capable of. Then again you already proved to be a traitor without any honor so I guess it isn\u2019t too surprising.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re getting annoyed with Sneak\u2019s disappointed routine. Especially when it\u2019s meaningless.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea of what I\u2019m capable of Sneaks. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t even rank slave trading as the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done. But since you\u2019re pointing the finger and moralizing like a Joachimite priest, let\u2019s turn this back on you for a moment. The day before I helped wipe out the Thieves Guild, YOU were gone. You must have already known the shit was going to get hot really quick and you turned tail and fled. You talk about how I betrayed everyone, but what about you? I was only a member for a few years and not even liked by Garrick. Why the fuck would I stay loyal? Tanya? She was a demonkin, you know demons can\u2019t be trusted. YOU were supposed to be Garrick\u2019s best friend and dedicated to his organization. Where the fuck were YOU?\u201d\n\nSneaks looks down and doesn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cDid you even warn anyone that there might be an attack soon? Or did you just pick up your shit and run as fast as you could as soon as you figured it out? In fact aren\u2019t YOU the one who said Garrick was a fool for having too much of a moral code?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right of course. There is no real honor among rogues. I ran like the preverbal thief in the night to save my own ass, and it was the smartest thing I ever did. I should have done it again as soon as I learned about you being here instead of letting sentimentality of my old friend and wounded pride cloud my judgment.\u201d\n\nSneaks snorts and chuckles.\n\n\u201cThought that MAYBE I could even get some redemption for at least not dying with my friends years ago. Guess I finally get to make good on that now\u2026unless you\u2019re planning on selling me into slavery like you have with so many others.\u201d\n\nYou draw your pistol as you walk over to Sneaks.\n\n\u201cNo. I figure I at least owe you a quick death for old times sake. Not to mention you wrecking Jicol the way you did, you\u2019ve given me even less to have to worry about since now that place doesn\u2019t even have the strong law enforcement numbers it once did, meaning the Nocturnal League\u2019s influence on it isn\u2019t even gone. Besides, I doubt even Vera would be able to talk a slaver into buying you for much anyway.\u201d\n\nYou point your pistol right at Sneak\u2019s forhead as he looks up at you.\n\n\u201cAny last words?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cJust a question. If I hadn\u2019t run all those years ago, would you have still killed me during the attack on the Guild?\u201d Sneaks asks.\n\nYou pause for a moment. You\u2019ve gone over this scenario in the past a few times and you already know the answer.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I guess this was worth it then.\u201d\n\nYou shoot Sneaks causing his body to jerk back with enough force that he falls back on his chair to the floor.\n\nNever thought he\u2019d be a loose end you\u2019d have to tie up, but life is always full of surprises. In any case, the JCR is finally finished and with Jicol still trying to rebuild, you\u2019re in a stronger position than ever.\n\nWhich is good, because you\u2019ve recently heard news that the Ebony Claw Syndicate has recently retaken it\u2019s position back in Holgard by either re-assimilating the \u201cHolgard League\u201d (As your splinter group called itself) or crushing those that opposed the re-assimilation.\n\nYou can only imagine that it\u2019s just a matter of time before they come sniffing around here eventually. Maybe it won\u2019t happen, but better that you be prepared so you don\u2019t end up like the Thieves\u2019 Guild or the JRC since that would be quite the ironic fate indeed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 33\n\nYou\u2019ve had to deal with many struggles during your life and not all of them of the mundane criminal variety. If that were the case, your life would have probably been a lot simpler.\n\nThe worst you believe was whenever you had to deal with magic shit. Specifically that time when you had to deal with the Neroth cultists. You really thought you were dead that night. If it hadn\u2019t been for Tanya, you would have.\n\nHell, you would have been dead without her when you dealt with that bushwacking shadow magic using asshole Bolt as well.\n\nThen there was the time you had to deal with the Joachimites and while Tanya wasn\u2019t there for that, you still had some magical assistance of your own to take out Yinin.\n\nThe point is, you always at least had a way to deal with magical threats.\n\nThis however you have no idea\u2026\n\n\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes. I was sitting there watching Kol playing on the floor with some blocks and stacking them. Then I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because it looked like he was interacting with the shadows cast by the blocks due to the candle light. Then I realized that\u2019s exactly what he was doing.\u201d Vera remarks and she holds on to Kol who looks fairly unfazed by any of what you\u2019re discussing. He just smiles at you.\n\nYou rub your hands on your head.\n\n\u201cI told you making our home in a fucking Fel temple wasn\u2019t going to be a good idea.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cDuly noted, but that\u2019s not really helpful right now. What we need to do is go find someone with more magical knowledge than you or I to look at Kol.\u201d\n\u201cWell who might that be? This island doesn\u2019t exactly have a lot of priests or wizard types.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s that witch that runs that shop in Jicol.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t her place get destroyed during the flood? Even if it didn\u2019t I\u2019m not sure what some witch could do if Fel cursed our son.\u201d\n\nSuddenly a voice speaks causing you both to look toward the entryway of the room.\n\n\u201cYour son hasn\u2019t been cursed by Fel, quite the opposite in fact. Your son has actually been blessed by him and he\u2019s now displaying the affects.\u201d Gertrude says.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t like Gertrude acting as a \u201cbabysitter\u201d on occasion before, the way she\u2019s speaking doesn\u2019t make you like her any better. You immediately start to move towards her. Meanwhile Gertrude immediately puts her hands up and backs away.\n\n\u201cBoss! I\u2019m not the enemy! Honest!\u201d she quickly says as Vera grabs your shoulder to stop you.\n\u201cVery well Gert, but you need to speak quickly NOW.\u201d Vera says.\n\nGertrude breathes a sigh of relief and starts talking.\n\n\u201cOkay, don\u2019t get mad, but I thought I saw the signs that your son had the shadow gift a few times before.\u201d Gertrude says.\n\u201cWait, you KNEW and didn\u2019t fucking tell us?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure! Like your wife, I thought maybe it was just my eyes playing tricks on me or I was overly tired. However a couple days ago something happened that couldn\u2019t possibly be the case. I saw Kol making shadows on the wall with his hands. At first it just seemed to be him trying to figure out what was going on and not realizing it was the candlelight causing it, but then the shadows began acting independent of what his hands were doing. Soon they became little figures which he watched and was amused by, and then they disappeared altogether. I would have told you sooner, but\u2026I dunno I was sort of shook up myself about it and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to approach it and I kept going over\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, fine, Gert. Does anyone else know?\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cNot to my knowledge. But again, this isn\u2019t a bad thing! This is a good thing! Your son obviously has natural shadow magic ability.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to know a lot of about this, why is that exactly?\u201d you say once again moving towards Gertrude.\n\u201cWell, as I told your wife before, I came from a large family and my one of my younger brothers became a Felian priest. Oscar displayed similar signs of having shadow magic abilities, as he grew older. Bit more of a late bloomer than your son though, but they were still present. He of course went to the temple in Holgard, where they started training him immediately, but I guess he was really showing some talent because he ended up getting transferred to the main temple in the Delantium Kingdom. Haven\u2019t really spoken to him since, but I always figured that didn\u2019t hurt my own standing in the ECS at the time seeing as the two organizations were allies.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that explains a few things, but do you know how this happened exactly? I mean is it just because we\u2019re inhabiting a Fel Temple?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019m not an expert on the whole will of the gods thing. I imagine it probably is playing a part. When Oscar was born my mom went into labor right in front of the Fel Temple in Holgard, so I assume maybe something similar is going on here. Maybe infants just catch Fel\u2019s attention, but as I said, I\u2019m no expert. We\u2019d need to contact a priest of Fel to gain further information on all this stuff. In fact, you\u2019re probably going to want to do that anyway since his abilities are probably going to get stronger and he\u2019ll need the guidance. Don\u2019t really know any Fel priests on this island though.\u201d Gertrude says.\n\nYou start shaking your head.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not having my son joining a bunch of fanatics.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, but his powers might become uncontrollable without proper guidance and I think you both know just how dangerous shadow magic can be. He\u2019s obviously been chosen by Fel, so I don\u2019t think you have choice.\u201d Gertrude remarks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, there\u2019s always a choice.\u201d\n\u201cGert, can you excuse us for a moment?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cOh. Yeah sure.\u201d\n\nGertrude leaves while Vera goes to put Kol (Who has fallen asleep during all this) in his basket.\n\n\u201cLook Vera, I know you\u2019re close with Gertrude and she\u2019s been helpful, but I\u2019m NOT inviting religious fanatics here, let alone having my son join them.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNot sure why you\u2019re yelling, considering I agree, but I\u2019m still leery about seeing some witch. I almost feel like we should just try to handle this ourselves.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a non-aligned magic user give their opinion, but if I feel like things are shady there, like her demanding his blood or something, then I\u2019ll be walking out of there as well.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m still concerned about this.\u201d\n\nThe next day, you gather up Kol and prepare to head to Jicol. You ask if Vera wants to come, but she says she has a bunch of slaves she needs to sell and besides all that she says if something goes wrong and you are both killed, she\u2019ll still be around to take revenge.\n\nWalking through the jungle nowadays is a lot safer nowadays, though that probably can\u2019t be said for Jicol. Ever since the city got half flooded, it\u2019s been having criminal activity problems, though not really coming from your end of things, since you\u2019ve practically got your own small town now (Still trying to think of an official name for it).\n\nIt\u2019s more along the lines of people who lost everything in the disaster are preying upon each other and other citizens in general. Between trying to still keep a strong naval force to ward off pirates and cleaning up after the disaster, Jicol\u2019s order attempts have been lack luster. So much for their plans of having a \u201cclean city.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not really concerned though since you\u2019re still capable of taking care of yourself and three of your people have offered to come with you, which seems wise just in case the desperate think about messing with you. Even the Jicol Watch isn\u2019t going to hassle you when they got people killing each other over qweepa meat.\n\nWhen you get to Jicol, it\u2019s looking about as well as it did the last time you bothered to come here. It\u2019s a bit of a chore to get to your destination since it\u2019s right around where most of the flooding occurred so you have to take a small boat to the area.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s on the strange side is probably Kol. You were sort of expecting him to make a lot of noise or otherwise be lively during this whole thing, especially since this is his first real trip outside the temple, but he\u2019s been fairly quiet. Then again he\u2019s thankfully never been a loud child.\n\nMakes you wonder if his quietness also has something to do with Fel. You still haven\u2019t seen any of the evidence of shadow magic like your wife or Gertrude have though.\n\nYou eventually find the shop you\u2019re looking for \u201cElegant Elixirs.\u201d You tell your people to wait outside and you open the door and you\u2019re immediately assaulted by the strong smell of herbs and who knows what else. It actually causes you to cough a bit.\n\n\u201cHm? Who is that? Better not be you Timothy, I told you I wouldn\u2019t have that endurance potion ready until tomorrow. The whores will just have to wait\u2026\u201d an old lady says as she comes out from another room.\n\nShe sees you and she looks a bit surprised, but not overly so.\n\n\u201cOh. Well haven\u2019t seen you in here before. What brings the head of the Nocturnal League to my humble shop?\u201d\n\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone? You\u2019re arguably better known than the Mayor of Jicol, ol\u2019 whatshisname. Probably more popular at this point too. Surprised you haven\u2019t just taken this city over, or what\u2019s left of it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I\u2019m good with what I got right now. Anyway, I\u2019m here to see you since you\u2019re the closest person I know to a wizard on this island.\u201d\n\u201cAm I now? Funny, I usually get called a hedge witch at best and a charlatan that sells distilled goblin dung at worst\u2026well I suppose that last bit is true, but I save that for the asshole customers.\u201d\n\u201cWell as I said, I\u2019m not here for potions, I\u2019m here to see if you can assist me with my son\u2019s condition which I doubt if any potion is going to cure and a doctor isn\u2019t going to be able to help either.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I did notice you carrying a little one on you back. Son huh? Well sit him on the table over there and tell me what\u2019s going on then.\u201d\n\nYou sit Kol on the table and being your tale, while the old witch begins studying him. As you\u2019re telling your tale, the witch does some sort of motion with her hands which briefly causes her to turn invisible. She then smiles and tells Kol to make the same hand gesture.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You ask.\n\u201cShh, quiet.\u201d The witch says.\n\nKol smiles back and he seems to understand what the witch wants him to do. After a couple of fumbled tries, he repeats the same thing the witch did and sure enough he too very briefly blinks out of existence. Then he laughs about it.\n\n\u201cWell that checks out.\u201d\n\u201cShit. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve actually seen Kol do any shadow magic stuff. So should I be concerned?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what exactly? Your son just happens to be the lucky few, that has natural magical talent. Just happens to be shadow oriented, though with a little training, he could probably become skilled in other types as well. I imagine some place like the magic university in Delantium would be a good place to send him if he really wants to take advantage of his abilities. Though I suppose the one in Klyton is okay if you want to save money.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about Fel?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about him? Oh you worried that your son is some chosen one or something? Let me tell you about Fel, he\u2019s like all the rest of the gods, doesn\u2019t really give a shit about any of us except as a source of amusement. You worship him or something?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, just wondered if we pissed him off by using his temple for something other than worship.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re openly cursing Fel name, I doubt if he\u2019s concerned. You would have certainly known by now. I mean I do agree that you probably caught his attention in some manner since your son is definitely skilled. Was he conceived in that temple by any chance?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah. The timing is about right. It was odd too since my wife didn\u2019t think she was fertile.\u201d\n\u201cShe might not have been, Fel might have seen fit to give her a little help, hence why the boy has powers.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly get a horrible thought.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026you saying Fel fucked my wife and this is actually his son?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo! Sheesh, you can\u2019t tell that the kid looks like you? My eyesight is shit and even I see the resemblance. I\u2019m saying Fel just provided a little magical or in this case divine assistance as far as the baby process is concerned. Your intimacy caught Fel\u2019s attention since it probably was the first time in decades anything like that went on in the place. Why you might ask? Well because it\u2019s a little known fact that Fel gets bored very easily and he probably did it just to amuse himself. Seriously, if most of the Felians knew what Fel was REALLY like, that would change the whole damn religion forever. Or maybe some of them do, but don\u2019t care since it\u2019s convenient to keep the hierarchy structure in place.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to know a lot about the Felians.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I used to be one. In fact I was a member of that very temple you\u2019re currently using when I was young and foolish. Even had one of those silly names they all like using. Grayhaze. I suppose it was better than my original name at least. Don\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\u201cWait, before we moved in, hasn\u2019t that temple been abandoned for at least over a couple hundred years?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Grayhaze says as if you\u2019re going to ask her age next.\n\u201cUm, never mind. So you\u2019re saying Fel isn\u2019t going to bother us at all?\u201d\n\nGrayhaze exhales a bit, scratches her brow before answering.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that. However, it\u2019s not going to be in the form of shadow demons or anything like that. That\u2019s actually not how he works despite what the reputation might be. Now once again, do you two worship Fel or acknowledge him in small some way?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, no. My wife didn\u2019t even like the idea of making the temple a headquarters.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, good, then he\u2019s not going to fuck with either of you directly through your dreams. Though honestly Fel is more of a voyeur most of the time anyway. It\u2019s his minions that do all the heavy lifting so you\u2019ll want to avoid them. In fact, I\u2019d say you shouldn\u2019t involve ANY Fel worshippers at all in this shit. They\u2019d probably try to take your son away or something. Speaking of your son, now Fel MIGHT take more of a direct interest in him since he is linked to shadow magic, but again it\u2019s mostly going be in the form of petty mind games of manipulation. Still, that might be concerning since he\u2019s an impressionable child and all.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\n\u201cCould be worse. I mean Fel\u2019s an asshole, but at least it\u2019s not Neroth right? However, I think I can help you. It\u2019s going to cost you though.\u201d\n\u201cMoney\u2019s no object.\u201d\n\u201cOh well money\u2019s certainly nice, but I don\u2019t really need any. I do however need ingredients for my potions. Lots of useful stuff out in the jungle, but I don\u2019t get out much anymore, especially with this place being half submerged nowadays. I got a garden, but just can\u2019t grow certain things in these conditions you know?\u201d\n\u201cSo you want me to gather plants for you?\u201d\n\u201cWell you can send your underlings to do it for all I care, but what I want is a free lifetime supply of alchemy supplies and the like. I know you\u2019re a man of means so should be pretty easy for you. Again, I don\u2019t care where you get them from, but I\u2019m going to make a list and that\u2019s what I want. And when I run out or need something else, I\u2019m going to want you to provide it for free.\u201d\n\u201cThis better be some really good help if you\u2019re making all these demands.\u201d\n\u201cOh it is, I assure you. I don\u2019t get much call for enchantments, probably because nobody bothers to ask, but I got a medallion lying around that I can enchant for your son to wear so when he goes to sleep it should block out any potential mental meddling.\u201d\n\nYou look at Kol and you look at Grayhaze and you can\u2019t help but have more questions.\n\n\u201cWhat about his magical powers?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about them? I mean he\u2019ll continue to have those. That\u2019s a separate issue.\u201d\n\u201cShould he have training so he doesn\u2019t accidently blow something up?\u201d\n\u201cWell I hope you aren\u2019t asking me to train him, I\u2019m far too old and like my free time too much. Honestly, he\u2019s probably not going to display too much power until he\u2019s a little older than he is right now. However, I suppose I do have an old magic tome I can sell you. I don\u2019t need it anymore and I have a few more, but he should probably start off with something simple when it looks like his abilities are getting a bit out of hand. While you may not be magical yourself, you can still assist him. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s in common so you or your wife can at least read the words in it, assuming you\u2019re both literate.\u201d\n\u201cYes we can read.\u201d You say with annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ll take the book too.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. Okay, so our deal for the medallion and a hundred gold for the book. It\u2019ll take me some time to enchant the medallion so come back in an hour unless you want to wait.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll come back, I have to go get the coin anyway. Come on Kol.\u201d\n\nYou take Kol and head back outside. You wonder where your people are since they\u2019re nowhere to be found. Since you know that they know better than to just fuck off while they\u2019re supposed to be helping you, you can only imagine one possibility\u2026\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nYou turn and see Gertrude standing nearby with the people you came with and all of them are pointing flintlocks at you.\n\n\u201cKnew you were untrustworthy.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell a good leader tends to have good instincts. If it\u2019s any consolation, I really didn\u2019t want it to go down this way and it\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d Gertrude remarks.\n\u201cNothing personal? Not sure if I believe that given that you\u2019re pointing a pistol at me.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I was part of the Ebony Claw and you know how powerful they are. When they dissolved in Holgard I could hardly believe it. When I learned that you had a hand in that to some degree and you stepped in with building the Nocturnal League, I thought that maybe you were definitely a man worth following. I even thought relocating was a good idea than staying in Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cIs this the part where you tell me why exactly you decided to be a traitorous piece of shit? Because if it is, then hurry up.\u201d\n\nGertrude laughs.\n\n\u201cTraitor? You\u2019re calling ME a traitor? What the fuck did you do? You betrayed not only the Thieves Guild, but the Ebony Claw Syndicate as well! All of which I might add is ALL catching up with you. Your old pal that escaped the Guild purge recently opposed you and now the Syndicate has retaken Holgard. How long is it going to be, before THEY decide they want revenge on you as well? Fuck that, I\u2019m making a deal before they send in the assassin squad and murder us all in that temple.\u201d Gertrude says.\n\u201cYou really think the Syndicate is going to just accept you back into its ranks?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not actually. I never actually betrayed them, however, your son is going to be a nice bonus. If I take him to my brother, I\u2019m pretty sure I can get him to pull some strings so I don\u2019t just get accepted but also a higher position in the Syndicate as well. So you see, this isn\u2019t being a traitor, this is improving my situation in life, that\u2019s what you did right?\u201d\n\u201cThe difference is you\u2019re not going to live to see the results because if you think I\u2019m going to just hand my son over, you\u2019re fucking delusional.\u201d\n\u201cYou put up a fight and you may not be the only casualty. Hand Kol over and I can assure you that your son will most likely have a better life than he would with you. The priests will probably see him as a chosen of Fel or something. Surely you would rather have your son be in his own position of power some day rather than a dead brat at the bottom of the Jicol bay.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Shield Kol from harm", "result": "You\u2019re not handing Kol over and you sure as hell aren\u2019t going to let any harm come to him.\n\nYou immediately turn with Kol in your arms and duck down while trying to run back into the store.\n\nAnd you are not quick enough as two shots go right into your back causing you to fall but somehow you miraculously manage to shift your weight so you don\u2019t completely crush Kol in the process, though he\u2019s definitely under you and not happy about it because he\u2019s crying quite loudly. You almost want to join him given how much pain you\u2019re currently in.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you idiots doing!? You could have hurt the baby! We need him alive!\u201d you hear Gertrude remark\n\u201cSorry Gert.\u201d One says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, just fucking get the baby and let\u2019s\u2026shit he\u2019s not dead!\u201d\n\nYou interrupt their little spat by managing to turn over and barely sitting yourself up. You manage to fire off your pistol, killing two of them. Gertrude fires and the last one however manage to hit you again just before your last shots bring them both down as well.\n\nYour body once again falls back to the ground in pain causing you to shout out. Though the pain now is only in your upper body since the lower half has gone numb, you can\u2019t even move your legs. Your son cries nearby and you don\u2019t think you\u2019re surviving this one.\n\nProbably due to the shooting, nobody is around of course. You feel like all the strength is leaving your body and lacking any other ideas, you call out Grayhaze\u2019s name in the hopes that maybe she can help you.\n\nYou do this for quite some time, but she doesn\u2019t arrive, neither does anyone else and you\u2019re starting to get sleepy. You try to calm Kol down with an increasingly weaker voice.\n\nJust as you\u2019re starting to lose consciousness, Grayhaze comes out of her store. She sees you and shakes her head.\n\n\u201cShit. I was hoping I was hearing things when I heard my name being called. Especially when not that many know it. I can\u2019t do anything for you. Your wounds are too severe and there isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d Grayhaze says.\n\u201cJust\u2026t\u2026ake Kol\u2026conta\u2026ct\u2026Vera\u2026in the\u2026League\u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s your last request, you can only hope that Grayhaze follows it.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Use Kol as a shield", "result": "This is probably the biggest risk that you are EVER going to take, or at least one of the most questionable ones. You can\u2019t even believe you\u2019re considering it, but given that Gert and the rest have the drop on you, it might be your only chance.\n\nYou\u2019re going to bet that despite her threat, Gertrude is NOT going to risk shooting your son. Besides wanting him to advance her own status, she probably did develop some form of connection while she was baby-sitting and you\u2019re not convinced she\u2019s going to be that ruthless anyway.\n\nYou hold Kol close who doesn\u2019t know quite what\u2019s going on and to your surprise\u2026\n\n\u201cDada!\u201d Kol says.\n\u201cFucking great. Your first words. Look, if we both get out of this alive, never tell your mother about this.\u201d You say, and kiss his forehead.\n\nYou then crouch down and stretch your arms out to place Kol in front of you and begin moving back and forth in a jerky motion. Gertrude\u2019s expression would almost be funny if this wasn\u2019t so serious.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026SERIOUSLY? You are fucked up! NO, DON\u2019T!\u201d Gertrude shouts and prevents one of the other traitors from firing at you, or rather pushes his arm so the shot goes wild.\n\nWhile they\u2019re arguing amongst themselves, this gives you the split second you need to drop Kol (Which since you\u2019re crouching, isn\u2019t far at all) and pull your own pistol.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d Gertrude shouts and at this point loses all of her confidence and tries to run.\nYou shoot the two traitors that didn\u2019t fire yet and then on the one that did. Then you shoot Gertrude in the back. With all your assailants down, you immediately check on Kol who isn\u2019t physically hurt, but is upset by all the loud noise.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know, the bad people made a lot of loud noise. Shhhh, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over now. Well actually let\u2019s make sure.\u201d\n\nYou pick Kol up in one arm and walk over to the bodies of the traitors who are indeed dead. A little further up though you see Gertrude still moving a little and groaning. You quicken your pace and stop her from trying to get in a shot at you as her last act.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026fuck\u2026agh\u2026\u201d Gertrude utters as you step on her wrist, take away her weapon and kick her over.\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re not dead yet. Now, you need to tell me who else was involved in this little scheme or I\u2019m going to pop into that hag\u2019s shop and buy something to keep you alive so I can torture the shit out of you until you DO tell me everything.\u201d You threaten.\n\u201cPlease\u2026no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStart talking then bitch.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026how do I know you won\u2019t believe me and torture me anyway?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t! But if you don\u2019t start talking, I\u2019m going to keep you alive for years to torture on general principle! Each day will be a living hell and you\u2019ll be praying to ALL the gods for the merciful release of death!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! There\u2019s nobody else! I barely even trusted these fuckers enough to follow me with this plan.\u201d\n\u201cYou in contact with the Felians or the ECS?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026I was planning on\u2026agh\u2026doing that when I got to the mainland.\u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cNothing else, I swear!\u201d\n\u201cYou know what Gert?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cI believe you.\u201d\n\nGertrude closes her eyes, and grits her teeth, bracing for her death as you put two in her head.\n\nNo sign of the Jicol Watch, in fact no sign of anyone. You use this opportunity to loot the bodies of whatever valuables they might have had on them since you need the coin for the book anyway.\n\nHappily Gertrude seemed to have a nice sized sapphire on her, which should definitely cover the cost in addition to the gold you do have. Since it\u2019s one less thing for you to worry about, you figure you\u2019ll go in and just wait in Grayhaze\u2019s shop for the remainder of your time here.\n\nYou head back into Grayhaze\u2019s shop as you continue to attempt to calm Kol down. Doesn\u2019t take long before she comes out of the back to see what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cIf you expect me to get this enchantment finished in a timely manner, you\u2019re going to have to keep the noise down.\u201d Grayhaze says.\n\u201cApologies, I\u2019ve almost got him quiet.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that, I\u2019m talking about whatever it is that happened outside. I might be old, but my hearing isn\u2019t. I heard shouting and several gunshots. I\u2019m guessing that you had something to do with that. Hope you didn\u2019t leave a mess right outside my door because the Jicol Watch rarely comes out this way to clean up anything.\u201d\n\u201cWell the bodies aren\u2019t exactly outside your front door, more like just near your shop. One of them is just outside the butcher\u2019s shop a few doors down though.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll have to remember to go get my meat from elsewhere for the next month, because I know what the cheapskate owner\u2019s going to do. Though I suppose things are tough all over\u2026if you could, drag those bodies that ARE outside my shop in here. I\u2019ll knock off a few coins for the book.\u201d\n\u201cUh, sure I suppose I can do that. I won\u2019t overlook a chance to get a discount.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it. And because I can already see it running through your mind, no I am NOT going to eat the bodies. I\u2019m going to harvest some of the organs for potion ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t care what you do with them, though aren\u2019t you really just making other people into cannibals if you\u2019re using corpse parts to make potions?\u201d\n\u201cEh, by that time, it\u2019ll be a diluted mixture filled with so much other stuff that it\u2019s not worth even considering. Besides, it\u2019s really no worse than what I put into some of my potions. If some of these customers knew what I used in my sexual prowess potions, I guarantee they\u2019d probably rather go lacking in that area.\u201d\n\nAfter a period of dragging bodies, keeping Kol entertained and general waiting around, eventually Grayhaze is finished with her task and comes back with a small black medallion and a small book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s finished. This chain is small enough that it should go around the boy\u2019s neck without it falling off in his sleep. However, I\u2019m not a blacksmith so if you\u2019re concerned with it breaking, you might want to get a better one made. Obviously the boy is going to grow, so you\u2019ll obviously have to get a bigger chain eventually anyway. It\u2019s the medallion that\u2019s enchanted though, so no need to worry about losing the magic.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, do I need to bring this in to recharge it at some point?\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need to. However, I can do this enchantment on any item. So if you brought in a ring, which might be a more secure item for your son to wear in the future, it won\u2019t cost anything as long as you stick to the deal. You don\u2019t however and you can forget about me doing you any sort of business with you ever again.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d\n\u201cGood, here\u2019s the book, the list of the various ingredients I\u2019ll be needing is in it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the coin, hope you\u2019ll accept a sapphire.\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nAfter a few more moments of Grayhaze explaining when Kol should probably start actively training from the book and how you can assist in this manner, you take your leave.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until night that you finally get back to which Vera is relieved to see you both. Kol actually fell asleep on the journey.\n\n\u201cI was about to send some people to Jicol to go after you guys. What\u2019s this around Kol\u2019s neck?\u201d Vera says as she takes Kol from you.\n\u201cProtection, in fact we\u2019ve a lot to discuss. However, I think things are going to be fine.\u201d\n\u201cGlad it turned out well then. Tell me all about it. But first, things have been busy here and I think Marco and the rest of his immediate crew wanted to see you tomorrow to ask about building their own ship or something. Says he\u2019s got an idea that will make us bunch of coin. Who knows though. I\u2019ve also got some slavers coming in so I\u2019ll be busy as well tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take Kol with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou will? Um, okay. Usually you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I probably should spend more time with him anyway.\u201d\n\nVera smiles a bit.\n\n\u201cWell this is a nice side to see of you. Still, you sure? I mean I\u2019m sure Gertrude can look after him if you find that you\u2019ve got more to do than you planned.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure because I just fired Gertrude.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFired? Wait\u2026really?\u201d Vera says suddenly coming to the understanding of your words very quickly.\n\u201cYep, just one of the many changes that were needed for Kol\u2019s future well being. That one was probably the most fun though.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Times passes\u2026", "result": "Year 34\n\n\u201cI gotta say Marco, I was skeptical when you first brought the idea to me and going by the story you\u2019re telling me, I\u2019d say I was completely right. Fortunately for you Yag smiles on fools and it worked out anyway.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah\u2026I suppose so.\u201d Marco says standing before you looking completely disheveled.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you came so clean with everything. I mean given the haul you brought in, I wasn\u2019t even going to bother asking you too many in depth questions.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah I know, but I was afraid if you thought everything went completely well, you would have sent us out again.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I suppose that was a bit of forward thinking on your part then, because you\u2019re probably right. Guess this is one of those rare cases where honesty was the best policy after all. Well I guess you and your little friends have finally gotten your pirate dreams out of your heads now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it sucks. Months out at sea, nothing to do. Rationing food and water. And the worst is getting lost. As I said, it was a good thing that merchant ship came when it did, our boat was starting to sink.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly an unconventional way of taking over a ship. Signaling for help legitimately, being invited aboard as an act of mercy and then when you were feeling slightly better, you just held them all at gunpoint. Still, not only did you bring back an entire new ship intact, you brought back most of the crew as slaves, as well as all the loot. Not sure what we\u2019re going to do with crates of scrolls with Nichan writing all over them, but I\u2019m sure someone is going to have an interest in this stuff. Always a market for something.\u201d\n\nMarco just nods silently, he\u2019s obviously just glad you aren\u2019t punishing him and he\u2019s back on dry land. You didn\u2019t think much of Marco and his \u201cgang\u201d when you first met them, and to be honest you still don\u2019t, but you suppose they\u2019ve come a long way since those days or at least the ones that have survived have.\n\n\u201cAlright Marco, I guess you and what\u2019s left of your group friends can go take some time or whatever for the next couple days. Don\u2019t go too far though, never know when some extra bodies might be needed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThanks boss.\u201d Marco replies and takes his leave.\n\nWith Marco\u2019s shit out of the way, you go about inspecting the latest expansions around the temple, which is now starting to resemble a \u201ctown hall\u201d since there are separate buildings popping up all around it. These aren\u2019t just criminal types either opening up brothels or gambling centers. You\u2019ve actually got a some ex-Jicol citizens opening up legitimate businesses since Jicol is on the downturn and they\u2019ve lost their homes and businesses in that city thanks to the flooding disaster that the city STILL hasn\u2019t completely recovered from.\n\nDoesn\u2019t really hurt to have cooks, blacksmiths and the like around so you\u2019ve assured that they will not be harassed as long as they pay the usual \u201cprotection tax.\u201d While it\u2019s not exactly a proper town, already people are starting to give it the name of Nightfall. You imagine the name is related to the Nocturnal League\u2019s name as well as the deity that the temple was once dedicated to.\n\nSpeaking of Fel, you\u2019ve been checking to make sure Kol hasn\u2019t been having any odd dreams or anything. So far so good, and Grayhaze\u2019s medallion is obviously working. He still casts his little shadow tricks every now and then, but again nothing major. You figure in another couple years he\u2019ll be ready to start learning from Grayhaze\u2019s book proper.\n\nAs for you, the only concerns you\u2019ve been having, as of late is the Ebony Claw Syndicate and to a lesser extent, the Jicol government.\n\nThe ECS is always a looming threat in the back of your mind. You know there is going to be a reckoning with them soon and it\u2019s probably going to initially come in the form of intimidation first.\n\nSo far they haven\u2019t even contacted you, though you imagine when they do it\u2019s probably going to be in the form of several shadow magic trained assassins. If they\u2019re feeling benevolent, they\u2019ll try to intimidate you first into paying them a cut of your profits and then get rid of you later.\n\nYou suppose you could be big enough and out of the way enough that a take over might be considered costly for them and not worth it, but you can\u2019t help but believe that they\u2019ll try anyway.\n\nYour more immediate concern however is the Mayor of Jicol who has implemented draconian measures in rebuilding Jicol due to the fact that people were starting to leave the city and even coming to Nightfall. He\u2019s completely shut the gates to the city and not allowing anyone in or out unless it\u2019s by ship and even then it\u2019s only legitimate trade as Jicol has now banned all pirates and the like from using their harbor anymore. In fact if they come within a certain range of the city, they\u2019ll be fired upon.\n\nThis has put a bit of a crimp in your own businesses a bit. Your own \u201chabor\u201d isn\u2019t nearly big enough to accommodate all the visitors you might get. You\u2019re trying to expand, but there is so much else to do. Not to mention slaver ships and pirates now have to sail all the way around the island to dock at Nightfall so they don\u2019t get fired on now. It\u2019s a pain in the ass for everyone involved.\n\nGetting Grayhaze\u2019s supplies to her is also a concern, you\u2019ll need to get those to her somehow and with the city locked down, the only option is to somehow sneak in which means either digging a tunnel and risking another flood, or taking a small boat and trying row around to one of the open areas where the sea and the city have no barrier, but that would be incredibly risky given the heightened security. Using swimmers would probably be less risky, but not much better.\n\nIt was suggested a few times in the past that the League should just try to take over Jicol, but honestly it\u2019s not like that would have been really feasible or cost effective to even attempt. However, it\u2019s starting to look like you might have to do something though.\n\nYou envision that it would be possible to have your people sneak in during the night and employ hit and run assassination tactics against the Jicol Watch, and ultimately open the gates to let the rest of your people in.\n\nStill, your numbers still aren\u2019t overwhelming enough to make the potential victory to not be costly. This isn\u2019t even counting the small fortress that the mayor of Jicol never leaves which again isn\u2019t a problem to get into, but who know what the hell is in store for you inside.\n\nEven if you take Jicol, you\u2019re still left with its naval forces. Who knows if they\u2019ll just surrender or not.\n\nAny plan to attack Jicol is going to come at a cost. Since you aren\u2019t sure what to do, you ask the only person you trust about all this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cGreat, I was hoping for some enlightenment on this situation.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cWell I mean you\u2019ve explained the pros and cons of everything and I more or less agree with everything, including not being sure of what the best approach is.\u201d\n\u201cWell in any case, I gotta get the supplies to Grayhaze. Last thing I need is to piss off an old witch on top of everything.\u201d\n\u201cSneaking in the city shouldn\u2019t be an issue should it?\u201d\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass, but it can be done. It\u2019s also possible that this is going to just be temporary and even if it isn\u2019t, it probably won\u2019t hurt our business too much and we\u2019ll survive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026wait a minute. What about that merchant ship that Marco just brought in?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we use it to get into the Jicol harbor?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe once, and then they\u2019d probably execute everyone on board. Our people aren\u2019t exactly the most subtle, if you were thinking about having them masquerade as merchants.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, Marco managed to do it and he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cMarco and his crew were also genuinely in danger at the time so it was a lot more believable that they needed help.\u201d\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cPut the ship in danger?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying we hire some pirates to attack our ship as it approaches Jicol. Naturally the Jicol navy is going to go into action and our ship safely gets in the harbor while they\u2019re distracted.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cWell then our people come screaming out of it and start wreaking havoc in the city.\u201d\n\u201cHm, certainly a different idea I had about infiltrating the city which involved sending a few to scale the walls or swim around and attack silently over the course of a few days.\u201d\n\u201cCould work too. I mean if we did attack, we probably should go all the way with it so employing both tactics would be best. Also if we were going this route, with hiring pirates to provide back up, I think I can convince one I know Zamed, to lead.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I know who you\u2019re talking about. Never trusted him.\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s a pirate, of course he\u2019s not trust worthy, but he\u2019s had the most experience with doing privateer work for the Delantium Kingdom, so he\u2019d probably be able to organize a small group of ships to harass our enemies effectively. Of course it would be very expensive to secure their reliability.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I mean the plan with the merchant ship sounds okay, but I\u2019m not sure if I want to pay out any more coin for pirate assistance. Also I don\u2019t see them lasting too long against the Jicol navy and that seems like a waste.\u201d\n\u201cWell you wouldn\u2019t pay them all of it obviously and you could promise them some of the spoils. Either one of two things is going to happen. Either none of them survive and you won\u2019t have to pay them or some of them survive which means they turned out to be a better investment after all and you still probably won\u2019t have to pay much since I can\u2019t imagine there will be that many survivors.\u201d\n\nWell there\u2019s a couple ways you could go if you did decide to take over Jicol, though maybe the best solution is to just leave it be.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack Jicol with assistance", "result": "Vera\u2019s right, if you\u2019re going to do this, you need to exploit every resource you can.\n\n\u201cAlright, you have any idea if Zamed is coming around anytime soon?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s probably due in a week or so. He\u2019s been getting sort of predictable as of late.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cHate waiting, but fine. I suppose in the meantime I\u2019ll start getting shit ready on our side of things, since even if Zamed falls through, we\u2019re still doing this. Guess I better inform Marco that his days at sea aren\u2019t quite finished yet since he\u2019ll be the one to take the merchant ship seeing as he\u2019s got the most experience with it and nobody else here is much of a sailor.\u201d\n\u201cNeither is Marco apparently from what you mentioned on his attempt to be a pirate.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I\u2019m confident that he\u2019ll have at least enough experience to pull this off, since that\u2019s not going to be the hard part anyway, it\u2019s getting off the ship and out of the harbor area alive as soon as he enters it.\u201d\n\nLater when you inform Marco, (who was just starting to enjoy his time off) he is indeed not happy about hearing what his latest task is going to be, but you don\u2019t need him to be happy about it, just compliant. Which of course he is. He does carouse extra harder though for the remainder of the time off you\u2019ve given him though.\n\nYou inform the rest of the League of your plan and assign your most skilled to start finding ways (or making ways) of sneaking into the city now. You tell them not to engage anyone and to keep a low profile while they\u2019re scouting the security and such. You then tell them you want a report on everything within the next few days.\n\nEventually the large dark skinned pirate known as Zamed comes into dock and you have a meeting with him as soon as he gets off the ship. He\u2019s a little surprised, but intrigued.\n\n\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m wondering what this is all about, you don\u2019t usually speak with me like Vera has in the past. How is she anyway? Last time I saw her she looked pretty fit. Glad to see having a child did not ruin her figure.\u201d Zamed says obviously trying to prod you.\n\u201cYep, she is and still as limber too. I\u2019m very lucky man, but enough about her, let\u2019s talk about business. Sit.\u201d You say not even blinking an eye.\n\nZamed snorts and sits down and you go into your plan and his place in it. Already he takes umbrage to the fact that you\u2019re including him even though he hasn\u2019t agreed to anything.\n\n\u201cWait a second, you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions here. I haven\u2019t agreed to this little plan of yours and I\u2019m not sure what makes you think that I\u2019m going to.\u201d Zamed remarks.\n\u201cBecause you like coin and you\u2019re not adverse to great risk. Why else would you have hired yourself out as a privateer for the Delantium Kingdom and getting in the middle of their war with Nichan? You could have easily made a comfortable living robbing fat merchant ships. Given all that, with my plan you stand to make a lot of coin and for significantly less risk.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. I wasn\u2019t ever directly attacking a single Nichan city or facing the full might of their fleet. I just harassed and plundered their isolated ships, not to mention I planned out ambushes. Attacking Jicol is greater risk and you know it is, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even be asking for help from the likes of me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. It IS a risk, but you\u2019re not doing this alone. The entire Nocturnal League is going to be assaulting the city at the same time you and whoever of your grog swilling buddies you can muster up for this task. As I said, there will be a sizable amount of coin for all of you in addition to whatever plunder you wish from the town itself\u2026well except Elegant Elixirs.\u201d\n\u201cHrm. Why is that shop run by that old hag off limits?\u201d\n\u201cI have a deal with her.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026well not really interested in such things anyway. And while your offer is interesting, I\u2019m still not convinced going up against the Jicol navy is a good use of my time. You still haven\u2019t given an amount you intend to pay me and while plunder is nice, Jicol isn\u2019t exactly the most booming trading port anymore. They\u2019re having their own economy issues and stealing from poor cities that can put up a good fight isn\u2019t exactly profitable.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about Jicol of course, but that\u2019s another reason why this isn\u2019t going to be as dangerous as you believe. While Jicol certainly has enough ships to still look impressive, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been around lately to know what condition their fleet is truly in. They\u2019ve had to forego their expensive upkeep and in some cases even downsize their crews. Jicol\u2019s small flotilla is a hollow version of its former self.\u201d\n\u201cIs that right? I had heard that rumor a few months ago.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fact even before they closed their gates and tightened their security. Last gasp of a frightened government that knows its days are numbered. I mean it hasn\u2019t even fought anyone is quite sometime, how ready are they really without ongoing conflict to keep the skills sharp? You and I both know if you want to stay at the top of your field, you have to practice.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you want to know the exact amount I\u2019m ready to pay you, twenty thousand in gold coin. And that\u2019s just for you personally. Every captain you get under your command for this will get ten. However we both know there is going to be casualties, so YOU will get half of any dead captains\u2019 share. Now I\u2019m sure you can do the math and realize that will be a shitload of riches correct?\u201d\n\nZamed\u2019s eyes glaze over at the fortune he stands to make from all this.\n\n\u201cI suppose\u2026with that sort of reward, the risk is worth it. However, I\u2019d like to have half of my payment now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and you not show up at all? Not risking that. The best I can do is give you a thousand for hearing me out as your taste of the rewards to come.\u201d\n\u201cWell I had to try. So is there an exact timeframe for this assault?\u201d\n\nYou continue your discussion of your plan\u2026\n\nA few months pass and eventually Zamed returns with six more ships, Marco and his crew are about as ready as they\u2019re going to be and your spies that have been sneaking in and out of Jicol, have made steps in opening the gates along with just creating as much havoc for ground forces as possible during the actual attack.\n\nAs far as your involvement, you\u2019re going to take a lesson from the last time you led one of these attacks. Meaning you\u2019re not going to put yourself on the front lines and going to stay at a camp a mile away from Jicol\u2019s gates.\n\nThe day of the attack within the first hour you can hear cannons going off even from your position further in the jungle. With any luck Marco\u2019s crew will manage to make it to the Jicol harbor without getting sunk in the crossfire.\n\nIn another couple hours, a runner comes to you with news that your people have opened the gates and fighting is going on all over the city. Marco and his crew successfully entered the harbor and managed to fool the Jicol Watch long enough to break through, meanwhile Zamed\u2019s force has drawn away most of the Jicol ships, which are now fighting, in the open sea.\n\nNo sooner has this runner given you this information when a loud explosion is heard along with a visible black cloud in the distance of the city, you surmise that Marco\u2019s merchant ship that was also full of explosives was set off in the harbor.\n\nA few days pass and you finally step foot into Jicol proper. The Jicol navy has been either put out of action at the bottom of the sea or sailed away. Zamed and his own people have already begun pillaging the city. There is resistance still of course, but so far things are looking completely in your favor and apparently the Mayor of Jicol\u2019s small fortress has already been breached.\n\nYou head there immediately and find Marco standing outside giving orders though he looks almost as bad as he did when he came back from his foray as a pirate.\n\n\u201cMarco! This may surprise you, but I am actually glad to see you\u2019re alive.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThanks boss, um we\u2019ve almost taken the city, just trying to make our way to the mayor\u2019s inner sanctum.\u201d\n\u201cGood, you remember the order was to keep him alive right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah boss.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I heard Zamed lives, but do you know of the other pirate captains?\u201d\n\u201cUm, not sure. At least one of them I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, you take some people and go find all those sea dogs and tell them I want to see them as soon as possible, I\u2019ll take it from here with the mayor here.\u201d\n\nMarco nods and you begin overseeing the final death knell of Jicol\u2019s government\u2026at least as it currently exists.\n\nAfter forty five minutes of observing the chaos around you and waiting, eventually the Mayor of Jicol is presented before you. He\u2019s about as unimpressive as his title. An overweight older man with spectacles. On the paler side of things, which makes sense given how reclusive he was. Obviously more of a planner and bureaucrat than any sort of fighting ruler.\n\nAnd yet a stare of defiance still exists in his eye as he\u2019s being hauled out to you.\n\n\u201cI should have had the Watch stomp out your organization years ago while you were in your infancy.\u201d He says.\n\u201cI certainly would have. To be fair though this probably wouldn\u2019t have been possible if not for that flooding disaster. Never did quite recover from that.\u201d You say and then look at the destruction around you. \u201cWonder if this place will recover from this, going to take a lot to rebuild this place. I guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cJust get it over with.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no, this isn\u2019t how we\u2019re playing this. At least not yet. We\u2019re both going to just stand here and talk while we wait for some of my people to come back.\u201d\n\nSince the mayor is in no mood to be talkative, you start things off by mentioning that it was a major mistake closing off his city in the way he did. You understand the reasoning, but by that time it just caused more enemies that might not have otherwise been. Like the pirates for one example.\n\n\u201cBeing a friendly harbor to pirates and the like made you fairly safe from them. I dare say it was a bigger deterrent than your navy in some respects. Changing what wasn\u2019t broken was foolish.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll remember that for the next city I oversee.\u201d The mayor remarks.\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re staying optimistic.\u201d\n\nYou talk to the mayor for a little while longer about how you\u2019ve come to understand the struggles of running a town of sorts and how even though taking control of this place, you are not looking forward to the operations of it.\n\nThe mayor just looks at you with a continued defiance until a couple of your people bring a woman in her late middle age to you. She probably was prettier back when she was younger. Now the mayor\u2019s eye betray him slightly as a glint of concern crosses his face before returning to defiance.\n\n\u201cWe all have someone we care about mayor. It\u2019s a weakness, but an unavoidable one for most I think. You\u2019re not married and this one is one of the few non military and non government people that had been seen entering this place on many occasions. So guessing this woman is a long time girlfriend? Perhaps even a daughter? Not both I hope\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you have planned, I\u2019m not playing your game.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game mayor, but I think we\u2019re about to see one. Marco! You\u2019re back with Zamed and whoever these other people are.\u201d You say turning your attention away from the mayor and the woman for a moment.\n\nMarco and the people with him nod and stand back as Zamed and two other scruffy looking men stand before you. All three of them look annoyed that you\u2019ve taken them away from whatever else they were doing.\n\n\u201cI hope this is about our payment.\u201d Zamed says.\n\u201cOh it is. So out of the seven ships, you three are what\u2019s left huh? Didn\u2019t catch your names.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCaptain Elias of the Kraken.\u201d A fat bearded man slightly shorter than Zamed says.\n\u201cCaptain Nimi of the Seadragon.\u201d A weathered looking elf with odd coral looking armor says.\n\u201cWow, those are some impressive names for ships. Bet you lot gave hell to the Jicol navy.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight we did and those that we didn\u2019t sailed away like scared guppies!\u201d Elias laughs.\n\u201cAs I recall, YOU nearly ran away like a scared guppy until I saved your fat ass.\u201d Nimi remarks.\n\u201cI should cut yer tongue out for saying such lies, ya pointy eared boy lover!\u201d\n\u201cGentlemen! I\u2019m sure you both played your role.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019M the lead commander here! And I think it\u2019s time to pay the coin, have you brought it with you on a baggage cart somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cOh I would never bring such a large sum with me. It can be picked up when you dock your ship at Nightfall. Let\u2019s see, four dead captains means you get an extra ten on top of the twenty you\u2019re already getting Zamed. And you two get ten apiece\u2026now which one of you two nearly sailed away from battle again?\u201d\n\nNimi immediately says Elias who once again protests to the point where he\u2019s looking like he\u2019l get violent. Meanwhile Zamed tells them both to shut up.\n\n\u201cI saw the entire battle from the deck of my own ship and Elias you WERE about to sail away. In fact your ship and crew took the least damage out of everyone here! You oughta be glad that I\u2019m not shooting you and taking half your share!\u201d Zamed says.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a grand idea there Zamed. Marco\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nZamed\u2019s eyes widen and he goes for his weapon.\n\n\u201cN\u2026\u201d is all he gets out before you outdraw him and put three in his face. Meanwhile marco has killed the elf captain with a shot to the back of his head making his armor useless.\n\nCaptain Elias stands there in shock as two of your men disarm him. He really is a big coward.\n\n\u201cShit! Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Elias utters.\n\u201cShut up. Now I trust twenty thousand gold is enough for you and enough to throw at your crew and the crews of these dead captains to ensure their loyalty under your new command of two more ships now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm\u2026sure! Yeah! That\u2019s more than enough for me and my\u2026larger crew now!\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it. I suggest you go tell everyone of your good fortune and meet me at Nightfall in a day for your payment.\u201d\n\nCaptain Elias and grovels gratitude before leaving. You snort a bit of laughter before walking over to the mayor and the woman who have been watching the entire time.\n\n\u201cNow as I was saying, this isn\u2019t a game. You think I really want to run the boring day to day shit of a city, even a half destroyed one? I barely like doing it for the little town I run. No, better to leave that in the hands of someone with experience, someone like you. Of course this place will have to have new security now that all yours are dead, but I can provide that. Of course if you don\u2019t want the job\u2026\u201d you say and then look at the woman.\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d The mayor says probably rethinking everything after what everything he\u2019s seen.\n\u201cGlad to hear it and don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll have as much help as you need to rebuild this place. Come to think of it, we do have a surplus of slaves. Maybe Jicol could start using such cheap labor on a regular basis. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to see an old woman who has probably been wondering where her supply shipment has been for months.\u201d\n\nPeople have been suggesting it for years, but Jicol is finally under the grip of the Nocturnal League, meaning this entire island is under your control. If the Ebony Claw Syndicate sets foot on here now, you\u2019ll be in a stronger position to deal with them.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the general idea.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 35\n\nTalking to two Syndicate representatives isn\u2019t exactly what you want to be doing right now, but this day was coming one way or another.\n\nThe well-dressed man with a thin mustache is Percy and has been the more talkative of the two. The other by the name of Toz is some sort of greenskin halfbreed also well dressed. Probably of orc heritage since he\u2019s much bigger than Warts was. He also doesn\u2019t talk much and mainly just stands around looking intimidating.\n\nUnsurprisingly the pair of them have shadow magic powers. However you anticipated that which why you had Grayhaze enchant something that would at least even up the odds. A ring. Not quite an anti-magic field, but something to dull the shadow magic around you.\n\nProbably wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop them if they really wanted to kill you, but along with all your more mundane security, it\u2019s enough to give them pause if they tried. However if that were the intent, you probably wouldn\u2019t be having a conversation at all.\n\n\u201cI have to say, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect when the Syndicate sent me here, but I am a little impressed with what your organization has accomplished in such a short amount of time. You certainly have not just carved out this little island for yourself, but much of sea paths on this side of the world. You\u2019re practically like your own nation.\u201d Percy remarks.\n\u201cNever thought about it that way, but I suppose you might be right. I also suppose I should be wondering if the Delantium Kingdom will be declaring war on me to put an outpost here.\u201d You say with a mild chuckle.\n\u201cI believe they have their hands quite full still with Nichan, though I hear you\u2019re starting to have more trouble with Hessla nowadays. I imagine you would be major competition for their once near monopoly on business for this part of the world.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I guess you could say relations are strained with Hessla, but we offered them a fair deal. Their Governor is the one that decided to be greedy and reject it. His unwillingness to embrace in a positive manner change is what is causing people to do less business there. He probably fears that I\u2019m going to come there with a fleet and take his city like I did with Jicol, but it\u2019s not even the same situation. The Nocturnal League doesn\u2019t seek to expand past our reach. This island is more than enough territory for us.\u201d\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a wise man who knows his limitations. Perhaps by making your home in an old temple once dedicated to Fel has resulted in him providing that wisdom. Ah, tis a shame that the Syndicate only just started sending people this way. Reclaiming a lost temple to his great shadow would have been not just a boon to the Syndicate, but to the glory of Fel.\u201d\n\nYou always hate how intertwined the Syndicate is with the whole Fel religion. Makes dealing with them always uncertain. Are they interested in profit or are they interested in spreading faith?\n\n\u201cOh well, the Syndicate\u2019s loss for being too slow when opportunity called I suppose. Doesn\u2019t happen often, but we hope to correct that by hopefully having a working relationship with your organization.\u201d Percy remarks.\n\u201cWell I certainly want an amicable relationship with the Syndicate and as I said, I have no intention on expanding into your territory.\u201d\n\u201cYes, so you\u2019ve said. However, your island is becoming very popular in terms of the slave trade. It\u2019s just one of the big reason why Hessla is so angry with you. The Syndicate has never relied on the slave trade as our main source of income, indeed for whatever reason it\u2019s just never been a cornerstone. One of the few things we\u2019re just dabblers in. We\u2019re trying again however, and while Hessla in the past has always been a stubborn partner in such thing in the past, we\u2019re hoping the League\u2019s rising status in this part of the world will be more open in such matters.\u201d\n\u201cSo basically what you\u2019re saying is instead of you having to deal with independent slavers all the time, you want to just deal with us.\u201d\n\u2018We find that it\u2019s always better to deal with a single reliable source rather than all these unwashed disorganized types. We would of course bring our own ship here for pick up. Also we\u2019ve notice that the drug of choice here on this island is either Green Lotus or that very poor substitute of Blue Dream, Purple Wish. As part of our new arrangement we could provide Blue Dream for you to distribute here. Makes a lot of money, we should know after all.\u201d\n\nAnd here it is, the Syndicate trying to get their foot just enough in the door.\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019ve given me a lot to think about as far as business is concerned.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh sure, we understand. We\u2019re going to be in Jicol for awhile so we can sort out details then. Honestly, I\u2019d prefer to stay here in Nightfall closer to the temple, but Toz here is a little on the paranoid side and doesn\u2019t wish to sleep in the heart of\u2026 let\u2019s just say, an unproven ally\u2019s home, but I\u2019m sure that will change soon! Besides, Fel\u2019s shadow is everywhere after all and his dark blessing is with his faithful always.\u201d Percy remarks.\n\nAt this point Percy says a few more pleasantries and then remarks about looking forward to the meeting with you in a few days. Toz on the other hand just stares at you with the typical hostile greenskin eyes and follows Percy.\n\nAfter they leave, several of your people escort them out of the room and anyone else left, seems to relax slightly.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the average Syndicate member, boss?\u201d Marco asks.\n\u201cNot the average. They wouldn\u2019t send their average. They send their more threatening to talk to someone like me. They also sent an extra one, which I guess means I\u2019m really special. Lucky me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo you think we should just kill them?\u201d\n\u201cIdeally that would be the safest move in the short term, but not in the long term and if we are going to war with them, I\u2019d like to be sure that it\u2019s necessary. So far they haven\u2019t given any indication that they\u2019re planning anything other than an aggressive business exchange that would have them visiting here on occasion\u2026which granted could lead to problems in the future. In any case, we\u2019ll wait for now.\u201d\n\nYou tell Marco to keep everyone extra alert while the Syndicate is visiting and then go see Vera who is down in the slave den as usual. Right now she\u2019s speaking with one of her overseers.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell have you been doing with these elves, Halford? They look like shit and nobody wants elven bitches that look like shit, they want them to look like they just came out of the fairy kingdom farting rainbows and sunshine.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cApologies Countess, some of the new recruits thought to take advantage of a few of them last night. They\u2019ve already been dealt with, even sold the ringleader this morning.\u201d Halford replies.\n\u201cHrm, well release the rest then, and remind them that these slaves are not their personal fuck toys unless they\u2019re actually going to be paying for them out of pocket. As for these elves, well have them cleaned as much as you can and hopefully some of the buyers aren\u2019t picky about bruises.\u201d\n\nHalford nods and complies with Vera\u2019s orders and as he\u2019s leaving he also nods in respect to you.\n\n\u201cI see you weren\u2019t joking about wanting to be called countess.\u201d you remark.\n\u201cWell we do run an entire island, seems perfectly reasonable to declare ourselves the rulers of it.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cTrue, though interesting you\u2019ve picked a royal title though.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about you, but a title like governor or mayor doesn\u2019t sound nearly as impressive. Besides if you remember I do have royal blood in my veins.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes. Your father may have been the late Baron Varsakken. Still, even if true, you\u2019ve given yourself the title of countess rather than baroness.\u201d\n\u201cWell unlike the rest of that Varsakken clan, I\u2019m actually in control of an entire island rather than just a city. I think that calls for a higher title status.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well why not queen then?\u201d\n\u201cToo predictable and self-important. I\u2019m still grounded enough to know who and what I am.\u201d\n\u201cWell glad to see you\u2019re staying grounded. Where is Kol?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s studying from that book you got him in my office and Layla is watching him.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head especially since this seems very familiar.\n\n\u201cI know you spoke to me about this before, but I\u2019m not convinced having a slave looking after our son is the best idea.\u201d\n\u201cWell you said, you had to meet with those ECS assholes and didn\u2019t want Kol around during that. And I couldn\u2019t supervise Kol\u2019s studies. This isn\u2019t like Gertrude, Layla was from some well to do family that Elias\u2019 crew apparently slaughtered on a transport ship. From the moment she was brought here she\u2019s basically been willing to do anything from getting sold as a fuck hole to some rich pervert or something similar.\u201d\n\u201cSort of surprised Elias didn\u2019t use her as a personal fuck hole if he was the one that brought her here.\u201d\n\u201cElias likes dick.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Huh, didn\u2019t know that. Well anyway, compliant frightened slave girl or not, I\u2019m wary about this.\u201d\n\u201cFine, if you\u2019re that concerned they\u2019re in the next room, you go speak with them both and get a feel for her. And when I say feel, I don\u2019t mean fucking her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh relax. I know you aren\u2019t really going to fuck her! She\u2019s a slave after all not royalty like me. She is very pretty though and the image of fucking her is probably going to pass through your mind. I\u2019ll be expecting you to lay it down really good tonight.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026okay\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIn any case, as I said speak with her yourself and if you still don\u2019t think she\u2019s a suitable sitter then we can sell her ass. Anyway tell me about your meeting with the ECS afterwards, I\u2019ll be free soon. Just have to check on one more slave shipment.\u201d\n\nVera kisses you goodbye and heads off to the next group of cages while you head to her office.\n\nUpon opening the door, you see your son fidgeting in his seat his in front of his spell book. He looks up and over at you before quickly returning to his book. Glad to see he knows that you really want him to focus on his studies.\n\nThe girl who you\u2019re guessing is Layla doesn\u2019t look that old. She looks to be in her late teens and is probably from some far off land given her darker complexion and some of her facial features. She\u2019s also still dressed in clothing that doesn\u2019t match her current slave status. (At least for most of them around here)\n\nVera was right though, she is pretty.\n\n\u201cUm, you\u2019re the Count right?\u201d Layla utters.\n\u201cCount? Oh. Right, Vera, Countess, whatever. No, unlike my wife, I see no need for formal titles. You\u2019re my son\u2019s new sitter from what she\u2019s told me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have been doing my best in seeing to it that Kol here is practicing his\u2026erm, shadow magic.\u201d\n\u201cCan I play with my shadow creatures dad?\u201d Kol asks.\n\u201cHas it been three hours yet?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou know that it hasn\u2019t. You have to learn other magic, not just the shadow stuff even if you find it easier. Layla, has he been practicing?\u201d you ask, while Kol goes back to his book.\n\u201cUm, yes I think so.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so? Either he has or hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cErm, I just mean I don\u2019t know much about this magic stuff. I\u2019ve just been making sure he\u2019s been reading this book. I did see him create a small ball of light briefly though.\u201d\n\u201cHm, okay. So Layla, do you have any other family? I mean besides the ones that those pirates killed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have an uncle back in Harazan.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell is that?\u201d\n\u201cFar to the south and west.\u201d\n\u201cHe rich?\u201d\n\u201cI imagine he is now. He\u2019s wanted my father\u2019s business and fortune for years. With everyone dead, and me stuck here, he\u2019s next in line to get everything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing he won\u2019t be looking for you anytime soon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026no\u2026\u201d Layla says looking downward.\n\u201cSo tell me Layla, what is your plan?\u201d\n\u201cMy plan?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I mean surely you\u2019re not content on being a slave. Who would be? And I can tell even in your less than perfect condition, you obviously came from wealth. You certainly look more royal than my wife. You\u2019re probably at least of noble birth. In any case, you are definitely not cut out to be a slave of any kind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you say is partly true I suppose. I very much would not like to be a slave, but I fear I have little choice in the matter. I was raised\u2026not sheltered, but very much protected. I don\u2019t have many skills that would be of practical use. I suppose its of some blessing that the pirate captain who spared me saw me as fetching a good price rather than to be something passed around by his crew.\u201d\n\u201cHm, Yag certainly threw a seven for you.\u201d\n\u201cYour wife probably would have sold me until I noticed how she was struggling with looking after your son while conducting her business. I quickly begged to help her by explaining I looked after my own little brother many times. I\u2019m still not sure how I convinced her, but here we are.\u201d\n\u201cYes, here we are.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned that I\u2019m plotting to escape, I\u2019m not sure how I could without you knowing and I do not believe I\u2019d make it very far. I fear that this is my life now and can only hope that you and your wife are merciful masters.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly resigned and calm about all this.\u201d\n\u201cI have already mourned over my family and continue to do so in the night when I cry myself to sleep. However, it is said that Ahamed has a reason for every event. I am hoping that I might see and understand this one and from there gain greater wisdom. My own family owned a few slaves for basic tasks, perhaps I am to learn how they felt.\u201d\n\u201cAhamed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he who burns brighter than the sun and shows the way of peace.\u201d\n\u201cOh, a god.\u201d\n\u201cThe only true god.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before, just not that particular one. Great. Well at least you aren\u2019t a Felian I guess.\u201d\n\u201cDid you say Fel?\u201d\n\u201cFelian, followers of Fel, god of shadows.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a worshipper of this\u2026god?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I just said I was glad that you weren\u2019t, why the hell would I be?\u201d\n\u201cOh, because your son was telling me before you came in that this Fel was speaking with him and\u2026\u201d\n\nYour eyes immediately widen and your whole body tenses up.\n\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d you exclaim causing Layla to cringe in her chair, but your attention is towards Kol. You immediately start interrogating the boy and her.\n\nAfter five minutes Kol and Layla are both in tears from your demanding questioning, however you have learned a few things.\n\nApparently Kol\u2019s medallion has been coming off in the middle the night and for the past week Fel has been speaking to Kol. Not to a great extent, but he\u2019s definitely been visiting your son and remarking about how great shadow magic is compared to all other forms of magic. He\u2019s also been trying to convince Kol of keeping the medallion off as soon as he goes to sleep.\n\nHowever the most alarming part is Fel asking your son if he would like to go be with Felians as he could see to it that they treat him very well. He even mentions possibly having agents that would come get him.\n\nNow you\u2019re wondering if this means Percy and the other one are here to take away your son\u2026or is Fel referring to other agents that he hasn\u2019t sent yet?\n\nKol was apparently afraid to tell you or Vera this since he thought you\u2019d both be angry, but he opened up to Layla since she seemed nice. Meanwhile your mind is racing on how to handle all this.", "action_results": [{"action": "Have the ECS representatives killed", "result": "You\u2019ve got all the information you need. No need to prolong this and besides, this was always a possibility anyway. Looks like you\u2019ll be going to war with the Syndicate.\n\nYou figure it\u2019ll take them at least a month or two before they figure out something has gone wrong when they don\u2019t return. You\u2019ll have time to prepare at least.\n\nIn the meantime you need to calm your son (and Layla) down.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, Kol. I\u2019m not mad. Calm down. In fact, you calm down as well, you\u2019re not getting sold anytime soon Layla.\u201d You say addressing the both of them.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you or mom. I\u2019ll make sure the medallion is around my neck good.\u201d Kol says.\n\u201cActually might be time to get you a ring, but don\u2019t worry about that right now. Just go back to your studies for now.\u201d\n\nYou then turn to Layla.\n\n\u201cAnd I trust you aren\u2019t going to speak of this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course not! I don\u2019t even talk much with the other slaves! I swear to Ahmed as I do not want my situation to become even worse.\u201d Layla remarks.\n\u201cGood, that\u2019s the proper way to feel.\u201d\n\nYou immediately leave and call for Marco who arrives shortly.\n\n\u201cI want you to gather the best and most skilled assassin types we have and send them to kill those two ECS fuckers. Then I want you to send a group of twenty more of the next best along with them. I don\u2019t care how they\u2019re killed, just do it quickly. Also I want all ships to not leave this fucking island until they\u2019re dead. We are not fucking this up.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to war with the Syndicate? I thought everything was going well, boss.\u201d\n\u201cShit changes. Now do what I tell you. Oh and I want their heads as proof.\u201d\n\u201cOkay boss, I\u2019ll get right on it. Um, what if any of them are currently helping the Countess?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit, you reassign them anyway, if my wife has a problem she can come talk to me.\u201d\n\nMarco takes his leave and you begin to mentally make preparations of how you\u2019re going to have to prepare your defenses. You figure you\u2019ll have a few months before the Syndicate realizes something has happened to their people and get their shit together to send a force after you.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before Vera comes to see you.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on? Marco just came in and took a few of my best slave minders and said if I had any complaint, I need to see you because he\u2019s just following orders.\u201d Vera says.\n\nYou explain the situation to Vera who is probably more concerned about Kol than any war with the Syndicate. She even asks you where Kol is and how he\u2019s doing. After giving your answer about that, she gets a little pissed that you haven\u2019t made the arrangements to get a ring enchanted for him and goes off to see Kol immediately.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before the task is underway. You eventually get a report from Marco that unfortunately despite the unexpected attack and all the people you sent, you only managed to get one of them, and it was the orc since they tried to take him out first believing he\u2019d be a tougher target, turned out to be true since he killed most of the people you sent before succumbing to the multiple shots to his body and head in the initial attack.\n\nPercy apparently didn\u2019t even try to help his friend and just ran off. He still cut down a few people along the way, but nobody can guess where he is now.\n\nBeing more paranoid than ever, you order that everyone from Nightfall to Jicol be on the look out. You also make sure Kol is kept under watch as all times.\n\nA few days pass and several of the pirates, merchants, slavers and sailors begin to protest that you won\u2019t let them leave the island, but in order to somewhat alleviate their complaints you wave any costs they might have. This helps somewhat, but many of them still aren\u2019t very happy. The slavers especially since they feel like they\u2019re being held captive and of course they know all about doing that to others.\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019re getting increasingly agitated with the fact that Percy still hasn\u2019t been found. He could be anywhere. You even order searches of the deeper jungle areas, which doesn\u2019t do much except get some of your people killed by dangerous wildlife. Even if he was hiding in the jungle, they probably wouldn\u2019t find him anyway.\n\nYou insist on Kol being kept locked up in his room at all times. Vera isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s the best idea, but she doesn\u2019t have a better one. She\u2019s mainly just as frustrated about this situation as you are and you\u2019re both lashing out at each other a lot.\n\nAnother week passes and still no sign of him at all. There haven\u2019t even been any \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths. However, you soon get some not so mysterious deaths when a couple of the pirate captains kill some of your people while leaving the island.\n\nYou manage to sink one of the ships, but one manages to sail away. This situation is getting bad for business because opening fire on your usual partners is a sure way to have them never come back or worse seek revenge.\n\nThough you half wonder if Percy eventually got to these folks anyway. Perhaps promising a reward from the Syndicate if they got him off the island. If that\u2019s the case, you can only hope he was on the ship you managed to sink.\n\nWith things also starting to get restless in Jicol, you don\u2019t really have much choice but to ease up on the restrictions. One way or another he\u2019s probably getting off the island if he hasn\u2019t already and you\u2019ll just have to be prepared quicker.\n\nA month passes and the entire island feels like it\u2019s under the shadow of the Syndicate. Everyone is on edge expecting a Syndicate attack even if it is a little too early. You still keep Kol locked up for his own safety, but he\u2019s obviously not happy about it. At this point he\u2019s wearing an anti-magic ring to nullify any potential contact with Fel since the last thing you need is a god whispering in your son\u2019s ear.\n\nVera becomes concerned about you and tells you that you need to relax even if the situation isn\u2019t ideal because the last thing the Nocturnal League needs right now is an unstable leader.\n\nYou take her words under advisement, which is much more reasonable than she hoped for. You know she\u2019s right after all; it isn\u2019t going to do anyone any good if you\u2019re in the state you\u2019re in now.\n\nAnother month passes and things have settled down slightly. You constantly ask for news updates from the mainland, but nothing of major importance is reported. No rumors of the Syndicate preparing for an attack or anything.\n\nBy the middle of the year, things are almost back to normal on the island. You\u2019ve still got a lot of extra security around the temple, but restrictions have loosened a bit to the point where you\u2019re not keeping Kol locked up anymore. You still have not heard a single thing about the Syndicate. No threats, no rumors, nothing. Or at least nothing concerning you.\n\nTrue they could be playing it close to the vest, but you think you would have gotten at least something by now. Either the Syndicate is just making you sweat or they\u2019ve decided it wouldn\u2019t be worth their time or resources in going to war with you.\n\nWhile things are still pretty tense, you continue to try to get on with your business.\n\nWhile you\u2019re going over some of your expenses, you hear a knock at your office door.\n\n\u201cMarco, I told you just come in if you got something important to report.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Marco, he\u2019s been killed!\u201d a voice says from the other side of the door.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been killed! A lot of people have, you need to come this! I think it\u2019s an attack!\u201d\n\u201cAre Vera and Kol safe!?\u201d you say starting to get up.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about Vera, but Kol is definitely safe.\u201d\n\u201cHold on\u2026fuck\u2026\u201d you mutter realizing that today must be the fucking day that the entire Syndicate declares war.\n\nHowever, you were wrong.\n\nYou open the door and immediately you see a familiar face staring at you and before you can do anything a blade strikes quickly across your throat. You manage to raise your pistol before Percy easily grabs it from your hand as you fall to the floor choking on your own blood.\n\nIt was just one.\n\n\u201cYou know, it would have been easy to kill you months ago, but I think my time here in hiding has provided me with all the necessary information to give to the Syndicate to best effectively attack your organization. Well that and it was nice to see the shocked look on your face when you saw me again. Didn\u2019t have to be this way, but you can take solace in the fact that your son will not be harmed. His destiny with Fel is greater than what fate will befall the rest of this island.\u201d\n\nWith that last cold response of a man who was determined to take away everything important to you, your vision goes dark.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Gather more information first", "result": "Again, if you\u2019re going to move to make war on the ECS, you\u2019re going to be absolutely sure.

In fact, you calm down as well, you\u2019re not getting sold anytime soon Layla.\u201d You say addressing the both of them.\n\nThe pair of the them begin to calm down and cease crying while you\u2019re coming up with a risky idea.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you or mom. I\u2019ll make sure the medallion is around my neck good.\u201d Kol says.\n\u201cActually might be time to get you a ring, however maybe not right away. Tell me more about Fel son. How is he exactly towards you? Does he scare you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, he\u2019s kinda scary. I\u2019ve never seen him. It\u2019s just like\u2026I dunno\u2026a voice. It\u2019s loud, but it\u2019s like whispery. I don\u2019t know if he means to be scary though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not mean to me. He just talks to me. It\u2019s just really dark and his voice is creepy and that\u2019s scary. He says he wants to be my friend.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, do you talk to him back?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I asked him if he had a mom and dad, but he just laughed and said a god has no parents. I asked him if he had any friends, and he said he just had followers in places like this temple, but said they weren\u2019t nearly as amusing as you and mom.\u201d\n\u201cAmusing? Why does Fel find us so amusing?\u201d\n\u201cUm, he said he thinks what you did with the temple is a lot more fun than his other temples because of all those people you put in cages.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Glad we could entertain I guess.\u201d\n\u201cFel also says that he wishes he could speak to me more often.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll just bet he wants you to go to sleep without the medallion. Tell you what, when you go to sleep tonight don\u2019t wear the medallion.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes, you have my permission, however, and this is very important. When you talk to Fel tonight, I want you to ask him who is going to take you away so you know what they look like.\u201d\n\u201cBut dad I don\u2019t want to go away! I want to stay here with you and mom! Honest!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know son and I won\u2019t let anyone take you away. But this is just pretend and I want you to ask Fel anyway okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cKol, I think that\u2019s been enough studying for today, you can go play. Don\u2019t forget to put away your spell book though.\u201d\n\nKol nods and runs off with his book.\n\n\u201cHope I know what the hell I\u2019m doing.\u201d You mutter to yourself before turning your attention to Layla who is still sitting quietly and wondering what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\n\u201cI trust you know to keep your mouth shut about this.\u201d You say to Layla.\n\u201cYes, of course! Who would I even tell? I don\u2019t even understand what exactly is going on.\u201d Layla remarks.\n\u201cI dunno, you might talk casually with your fellow slaves.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly friends with anyone here. Ever since your wife had me looking after your son, she keeps me isolated from the rest of the slaves. If anything they probably dislike me more for having better living conditions. Sir, I swear to Ahmed I will not say anything you say or do if you don\u2019t wish it. My situation is very dire compared to my previous life, but I certainly don\u2019t want it to get any worse by angering you or your wife.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well see that you continue with that line of thinking. In any case, you can go tell my wife that I want to talk with her and that you\u2019ll do as a sitter for Kol when needed. At least until further notice.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Layla remarks obediently and leaves.\n\nYou wait for Vera still pondering your decision. When Vera arrives and you explain everything, she of course has her own strong opinions on it.\n\n\u201cWhat?! After everything you said and did to prevent Fel from contacting Kol, you\u2019re now saying it\u2019s perfectly fine?\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying\u2026gah\u2026look it\u2019s already happening and unfortunately it\u2019s probably going to happen from time to time anyway. Even if I get that enchanted ring for Kol, I can almost guarantee he\u2019s going to take it off at some point when we aren\u2019t around. Maybe he\u2019ll be curious, maybe he\u2019ll be pissed and do it to spite us. I\u2019m already envisioning what a problem he\u2019s going to potentially be when he gets older what with his magic abilities. I\u2019m just thinking that MAYBE restricting him too much is an exercise in failure. I know it obviously was with my parents.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, I get what you mean on that, but this plan of yours still seems pretty dangerous. Not only are we risking war with the ECS, the Felians, but the god itself.\u201d\n\u201cMight as well go big. If Kol is going to speak with Fel, we might as well try to use it to our benefit. According to Kol, Fel finds what we\u2019ve done with the temple to be amusing, so we can\u2019t be completely on his bad side. Look, I\u2019m going to speak with Kol again before he goes to bed and really, this isn\u2019t going to be a regular thing. If Kol gets the information he needs, then the enchanted medallion or ring when I get it is going right back on the next time he sleeps.\u201d\n\nVera has a bit of apprehension in the eyes, but as usual she tend to side with your decision, which is good since you don\u2019t need to be second guessing yourself anymore than you already are in your head.\n\nLater that night when Kol goes to bed, you and Vera both speak with him and say generally positive things to him. You also go on about the plan and to remember that no matter what Fel says, he will never love Kol as much as you and Vera will.\n\nThis seems to put the Kol at ease and he goes to sleep fairly quickly. You and Vera however definitely don\u2019t that night. The pair of you can\u2019t sleep so you both engage in the usual intimate pastime, but after that fails to completely distract you, you both go check on Kol, who is actually sleeping pretty soundly.\n\nThe pair of you watch over him for some time, though eventually you start getting a little restless and tell Vera you\u2019re going to get some work accomplished. Vera however, insists on staying with Kol.\n\nWhen morning arrives, you\u2019re still awake and you check on Kol, and find that Vera has fallen asleep in a chair next to Kol, who is still sleeping. Your arrival wakes her up though.\n\n\u201cWha? You\u2019re back. How long was I asleep?\u201d Vera asks rubbing her eyes.\n\u201cI dunno, this is the first time I\u2019ve checked on you both.\n\nYou son wakes up hearing both your voices.\n\n\u201cMom? Dad? What are you both doing in my room?\u201d he asks.\n\nYou immediately ask him how did he sleep and about his dreams. Naturally the boy is still groggy, but he soon answers your questions since he thankfully remembers his conversation with Fel who did indeed visit him.\n\nKol tells you that he asked Fel about being taken away by Fel\u2019s agents, to which he asked further questions if he was sure that was what he wanted and why. Kol tells you he didn\u2019t really know how to answer other than \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\n\nYou grimace a bit, thinking that this plan of yours probably didn\u2019t work, but apparently Fel indulged the boy anyway explaining the benefits of such a thing, oddly he also explained the benefits of staying here too. Then he told Kol that if he was really serious, he should contact a well dressed man with a thin mustache and he will be able to get him off the island before anyone figures it out since he knows what to do already.\n\nThe description already sounds like Percy.\n\n\u201cKol, is that the only agent that Fel described to you? Didn\u2019t say anything about an orc?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo dad. Just the man.\u201d Kol says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd. Wouldn\u2019t he have sent both of them?\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cHave no idea. I can\u2019t know the mind of a god. For all we know he could be lying about everything.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShould we really start second guessing ourselves? I mean wasn\u2019t the whole plan to learn this information and act on it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u2026argh\u2026this is really\u2026fuck it, let\u2019s do this. I want those two summoned back here and tell them I\u2019m ready to talk about a deal. I also want you to take Kol away from here and go to the armory or something with several of our best and wait until this is over.\u201d\n\u201cDo you really think you need to handle this directly? I mean we\u2019ve got several people; surely it would be just a simple matter of having one of them sneakily pop them in the back of the head with a single shot. Or shit, we could just send a bunch of people to overwhelm them right now where they\u2019re staying. I mean it just seems safer for all of us.\u201d\n\nVera might have a point, though part of you finds this pretty personal enough that you\u2019d rather take care of this directly.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to leave you guys. I want to stay here.\u201d Your son suddenly says.\n\u201cYou will son. You win.\u201d You answer reassuringly. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any chances with them somehow escaping, I want to see this done right. I\u2019m going to have enough people with me that the odds are going to be heavily in my favor though.\u201d\n\nVera reluctantly agrees to your plan, though she says she\u2019d prefer to just ambush the pair of them.\n\nYou set things in motion and have some of your people go fetch the ECS reps. You aren\u2019t exactly sure how this is going to play out, but you put on extra body armor and armed yourself with a couple extra blades and pistols and have Marco and everyone that\u2019s going to be with you do likewise.\n\nHonestly, you aren\u2019t sure how good your ring is going to be, but you hope it\u2019s good enough to keep you alive. If nothing else, they aren\u2019t surviving this.\n\nTime passes and eventually Percy and Toz arrive. Percy looks as jovial as he has since he got here, while Toz looks about as grim serious as he always has. You still aren\u2019t sure what to do about him. Fel didn\u2019t mention him, but you can\u2019t imagine that you aren\u2019t going to have to kill him as well.\n\nLooks like you\u2019ll be going to war with the ECS and you\u2019ll be firing the first shot. Really wish you could have avoided this, but that\u2019s no other way.\n\nPercy looks at his surroundings and with a smile he begins to speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting the impression, you don\u2019t want to talk about a deal with the Syndicate after all.\u201d Percy says, which causes Toz to immediately stand a little straighter and the rest of your people to put their hands to their weapons.\n\nYou don\u2019t even bother to make the pretense and pull your pistol immediately and point it at Percy. Percy doesn\u2019t seem bothered though and even puts his hand on Toz to keep him from attacking.\n\n\u201cYou realize you\u2019re killing yourself right? And I don\u2019t mean starting a war with the Syndicate, because you aren\u2019t going to live to see that anyway. Even with your advantage and weak anti-magic ring, I\u2026WE have more than enough power and skill to overcome what\u2019s just in this room. True, we probably won\u2019t survive, but we\u2019ll do enough damage to this entire place that when our absence is noticed, the Syndicate WILL assume the worst and send people to mop up what\u2019s left. Terrible way to do business.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility I considered long before you ever showed up. However, this isn\u2019t business. This is personal.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cOh? Interesting. Have I offended you directly in some way? Perhaps Toz here has? I know he\u2019s a little on the impersonal side, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCut the shit. You\u2019re here to steal my son. You know about him and you\u2019re here to take him to back to your main temple. Not happening.\u201d\n\nPercy seems surprised to hear you accuse him of this, but he soon returns to his smiling self. Toz on the other hand is showing a stone face looking like he really wants to get on with the fighting.\n\n\u201cAlright. Well, I can see this IS personal. On both sides. I mean I can\u2019t very well disobey a direct order from my god can I? I can only guess you must have found this out from your son who is also in contact with our shadowy lord. I wouldn\u2019t expect a godless heathen like you to understand, but if Fel is speaking to the boy then that only PROVES that he\u2019s destined for greatness! Think of it, your son is one of Fel\u2019s chosen! Surely you want what\u2019s best for your son. No harm would come to him.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cYou seriously expect me to just hand him over?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes! Because it\u2019s your ONLY logical move. I am willing to forget all this as\u2026an over protective parent outburst. Completely understandable. I will even work out a better deal between you and the Syndicate. Your son will no doubt rise in the ranks of our order. Just think, YOU will have a powerful ally on the inside, close to the Temple of Fel in the years to come. If you ever have trouble with the Syndicate, you will able to get support from our order to smooth anything over. It seems like a winning situation for all of us.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but that\u2019s still not happening.\u201d\n\nFinished with talking, you open fire and nearly instantly you feel like everything is slowing down in front of you. You see your first bullet actually hanging in the air and then Percy moving to the left. What torchlight there was in the room, goes out completely.\n\nYou begin swearing and shouting orders, desperately trying to adjust your eyes to the darkness. You already hear noises of men being killed and unfortunately they sound like yours.\n\nAll you can make out is a bunch of dark figures struggling with each other.\n\nYou suppose you could just fire blindly and hope you get them or maybe try to retreat out the exit where there is more light.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fire", "result": "You\u2019re probably going to hit some of your own people, but oh well.\n\nYou fire the remainder of your shots and from the sound of things you probably hit at least a couple people.

You fall to the floor face first and then attempt to crawl towards the better-lit corridor, but the last thing you hear is Percy whispering\n\n\u201cCould have settled this a lot easier, but take solace that your bad choices will not affect your son.\u201d\n\nThen he slits your throat.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Retreat", "result": "While your enemies are distracted, you need to get to a better location.

Already several of your people are heading in your direction.\n\n\u201cThe fuckers are in there and\u2026SHIT!\u201d\n\nThe torches go out leaving you in complete darkness again. You instinctively duck down and sure enough you hear the whizzing of several things, followed by the gurgling of the men near you in the corridor. One of them falls on you as you try to fire blindly in the dark towards the direction behind you.\n\nOther footsteps run off, retreating from your position and you\u2019re about to do the same when you suddenly feel a strong grip on your wrist and slamming your hand against the wall causing you to drop your pistol. You swing at your assailant, who you now can see is Percy, but your punch is blocked and you\u2019re knocked to the floor.\n\nYou manage to see the glint of a blade in the darkness and then Percy drops hi knees in your stomach, knocking the air out of you and attempts to stab you. He\u2019s quick, but despite your state of gasping for air you\u2019re just quick enough to grab ahold of the knife-wielding arm from stabbing you in the face, though it\u2019s now just inches from it.

Could have settled this a lot easier, but take solace that your bad choices will not affect your son. Now\u2026ugh\u2026\u201d\n\nYou hear the sound of a sharp object going into flesh, but it isn\u2019t yours. Even in this dark, you can see the dead expression of Percy whose mouth now hangs open slack jawed and dripping blood all over you. His neck is also dripping blood and his body is even heavier on you.\n\nAt first you think one of your people saved you, but then the torches suddenly light again and there you see standing over you and Percy\u2019s corpse is Toz in the process of removing his blade from Percy\u2019s neck.\n\nYou go for your pistol, but Toz immediately sees this. More of your people arrive at the end of the corridor ready to open fire. Even with shadow magic, he\u2019s bound to get hit without much space to dodge in.\n\n\u201cCall off your men, or this will not end well.\u201d Toz says.\n\u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m not handing over my son to you.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. Now call off your people, I\u2019ve killed your enemy as you can see.\u201d\n\nYou wave a hand down in the direction of your people from your prone position.\n\n\u201cYeah, why did you do that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAs I said, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here on behalf of the Ebony Claw Syndicate, not the Order of Fel. I was given no instructions by them or their god, and even if I was, my loyalty is always with the Syndicate first. They really do want a deal. Any past animosity you may or may not have had with them has been waved. This is business and everyone involved can make lots of money.\u201d Toz says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very pragmatic of the Syndicate, but unusual for the Order of Fel. I mean you guys that are heavily into the shadow magic side of things tend to follow that first.\u201d\n\u201cAnd orcs tend to be brutish thugs that speak in short sentences, but there are exceptions as you can see.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I suppose we can talk more. Just let me get this corpse off of me.\u201d\n\nYou verbally order your men to stand down, but approach slowly as you push Percy\u2019s body off of you. Toz stands back and keeps his guard up. Eventually you both return to the original room where you find everyone dead. You also see Marco lying near another body face down.\n\n\u201cDamn Marco.\u201d You say and go over to him.\n\u201cI trust you realize that I was just defending myself during the chaos.\u201d Toz says.\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve already established all that. But still, he was a valued employee. Improved much since the first time I met him\u2026wait a minute\u2026he\u2019s breathing.\u201d\n\nYou quickly turn Marco over and he\u2019s moaning about being in pain, which is probably true since his face has a hole in it where you guess he was stabbed. Fortunately it just missed his eye and the blade went into his upper cheek instead.\n\n\u201cBoss\u2026ugh\u2026dying\u2026\u201d he utters spitting up a little blood.\n\u201cYou are not fucking dying. This isn\u2019t a fatal wound you sissy. Get up and get yourself patched up.\u201d You say and start motioning him to get up.\n\u201cK\u2026ooogh\u2026hurts\u2026\u201d\n\nMarco slowly gets up holding the side of his face and is helped by a couple others out the room.\n\nYou turn your attention to Toz.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get on with this deal which I hope you know isn\u2019t going to be the same one that Percy first proposed when you both first got here, however it\u2019ll still be good for the Syndicate.\u201d\n\nAfter only an hour of discussion you and Toz come to an acceptable deal. You don\u2019t think Toz wanted to stay any longer than he needed to since he says he\u2019ll be leaving right away.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but ask though\u2026\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the Order of Fel be pissed at you and in general?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why. Percy died on the way here when the ship was attacked by mermaids and he jumped overboard when hearing their deadly song.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I suppose that\u2019s one way to explain away everything. Will it work?\u201d\n\u201cThe Syndicate won\u2019t care as long as the this deal is pleasing to them which it should be. As for the Order, well the goals and the Syndicate\u2019s goals clash at times. It\u2019s an ongoing struggle, but I believe with this deal, your son will not be whisked away in the middle of the night or something similar.\u201d Toz replies.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be on guard nonetheless.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s wise anyway. Though Percy never even told me this plan. I only learned about it the moment it was revealed in this room. I do not even believe the Order gave this command as Percy claimed he heard it directly from Fel himself. Though your words indicated that Fel spoke to your son as well. I cannot know why a god would give one a command, but only to sabotage it. Seems contradictory, but I\u2019ve never pretended to be the most fanatical follower. I worship purely for the extra power that the god gives me for whatever reason and use that power to support the Syndicate.\u201d\n\nToz at this point bids you goodbye and soon you go find Vera in the armory where she waits with several of your best fighters and your son. The pair of them are pretty happy to see you, even if Kol doesn\u2019t quite know everything that\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cYou okay dad?\u201d Kol asks coming up to you.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine son. And you don\u2019t need to worry anymore either.\u201d You reply and give him a pat on the head.\n\nVera approaches you.\n\n\u201cI heard fighting and wanted to help, but you insisted I stay here.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYeah, glad you listened, it got a little closer than I thought it would, but it\u2019s all worked out now.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cWell you can never be completely sure about these things, but we\u2019ll keep our guard up as usual and keep an extra special eye on Kol just in case. Maybe Grayhaze has something for that. We need to go to her anyway and get a ring enchanted to block out Fel again.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve angered a god by thwarting his plans?\u201d\n\u201cWell from what I can tell, Fel\u2019s plans mainly consist of him amusing himself. That was probably satisfied today from what I\u2019ve heard of him. Anyway, can\u2019t rage against the gods, just can only hope they don\u2019t fuck you up too much. Still a pain in the ass though.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I wonder if maybe our lives got more complicated after we left Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps in some ways, but its all been worth it. No point in wondering what if. In fact, given where I was mentally before we actually got together, I\u2019m glad this is where choices led me.\u201d\n\nYou give Vera an embrace and a kiss, which she returns.\nWith today\u2019s crisis averted, everyone soon goes back to their routines, though you take the rest of day off to spend time with your family.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a brief break, but at least a pleasant one and given the life you\u2019ve chosen it\u2019s best you cherish those when you can.\n\nLong gone are the days of being a simple rogue.

You quickly enter and try to get over your condition.\n\nIt\u2019s no use though, you had quite a few of those drinks and the urge is overwhelming. Since it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, you do the only thing you can think of\u2026\n\nAnd then you do it again immediately after.\n\n\u2026and then a third AND fourth time.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck did they put in the damn drinks, ground up unicorn testicles?\u201d you mutter.\n\nAt this point the excitement still hasn\u2019t subsided, and you still don\u2019t think you\u2019d make it outside. And if you bumped into Vera on the way, well you\u2019d definitely be taking her up on all those blowjobs she\u2019s offered you in the past. (In fact you were thinking about her the second time around)\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to start round five, the door opens! You forgot to lock it and suddenly it\u2019s like that time you were a teenager and your sister walked in on you accidently. (Man, that was awkward)\n\n\u201cShit! Get out of here!\u201d you say, though your eyes are already drawn to this woman\u2019s body, which is still covered up, but only by a very colorful form-fitting outfit.\n\nShe wears a half mask similar to the one you\u2019re wearing and her long hair is freely flowing behind her and partially on her shoulders. It\u2019s not white, but it\u2019s blonde enough to vaguely remind you of Tanya. (Though at this point she\u2019s dominating your thoughts)\n\nWhile you\u2019re busy making mental images, you\u2019ve neglected to cover yourself and this woman has been doing the same to you.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d You say attempting to cover up with a pillow and then once again telling her to get out.\n\u201cIf I step out of this room I\u2019m gonna end up fucking every person out there! Granted I\u2019m usually up for a good time, but I still like them ONE at a time. There is some seriously decadent shit going on out there and I was THIS close to joining in on it. If I knew they were going to put something in the drinks here, I never would have agreed to come to this damn thing!\u201d the masked woman says.\n\u201cWell we\u2019re in agreement there.\u201d\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as I started feeling weird I put down some of my belongings and left them elsewhere. One of particular importance too! Fuck, I can\u2019t go get it now. Argh, I guess it\u2019ll be safe. Probably won\u2019t get stolen, but I sure hope somebody doesn\u2019t destroy it in an attempt to shove it up their ass or something. Look, I just need a place to hide for a while. At least until the effects wear off.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea because if you haven\u2019t noticed, this is MY hiding spot! As for when the effects are going to wear off I have no idea. I just jerked off four times in a row and I\u2019m still hard as a rock.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour times? Fuck, that is fucking sexy\u2026\u201d The masked woman says and begins to touch herself while looking over your direction.\n\u201cHold on! Easy there girl!\u201d you say backing up a bit on the bed.\n\u201cShit\u2026this isn\u2019t going to work. We can\u2019t both stay here, or least we can\u2019t both stay here and not be fucking each other. To hell with it\u2026\u201d\n\nWithout another word, the masked woman begins to take her clothes off.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?! This is NOT a good idea!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cMaybe not, but I can\u2019t take this feeling any longer. My plan was similar to yours, but apparently that hasn\u2019t worked for you either. We might as well alleviate the pressure and have some fun. And at least I\u2019m not going to feel too bad about fucking a complete stranger as long as it\u2019s a one on one deal.\u201d\n\nThe top part of her costume is off and you\u2019re about ready to go fondle her tits. In fact you\u2019re already standing up from the bed and walking towards her to do just that.\n\n\u201cI seriously CAN\u2019T do this.\u201d You say, barely stopping yourself.\n\u201cAnd are you seriously telling me, you don\u2019t want THIS?\u201d she says and forcefully puts your hands on her tits.\n\nAs you caress her breast, you can feel the temptation overwhelming you. Her body is just\u2026perfect to you right now.\n\n\u201cOh trust me, I want nothing more than to get you on all fours and thrust into you until you\u2019re crying from so much pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get on with that then, because that actually sounds like a lot of fun.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t! I really can\u2019t do this!\u201d you say and pull your hands away, the woman\u2019s hands however go immediately to your crotch.\n\n\u201cYour dick says otherwise. Come on, I\u2019m fucking ready and I know you are.\u201d She says.\n\u201cIt would be dangerous.\u201d You say as you enjoy the scent of her this close up.\n\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, the woman kisses you and shoves her tongue in your mouth. You manage to briefly stop the grinding of your bodies long enough and pull your lips apart to speak.\n\n\u201cStop, stop! Seriously, this could be dangerous for you!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhat? Wait, you don\u2019t have the fucking crotch rot do you?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cNo, nothing like that, it\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s complicated and I don\u2019t have time to explain. You see, my girlfriend\u2019s a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMmmm, I won\u2019t tell her if you don\u2019t.\u201d the woman says and begins going down on you.\n\nAnd it feels sooooooo good.\n\nYou tried. You really tried. But you can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t any longer. The temptation is too great and this woman is too damn skilled, along with being very pretty. (At least from what you can tell, she\u2019s still partially covered with her mask)\n\n\u201cHold on, hold on, stop.\u201d You say one more time gently pushing her head away.\n\u201cFucking kidding me? What the hell now?\u201d the woman asks.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re gonna do this\u2026go lock the door at least. Last thing we need is more people wandering in and before we know it, it\u2019s not just us any longer.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you got a point. Okay.\u201d\n\nAs you watch her walk away, some guilt wells up inside you. You\u2019re going to kill this girl and you just don\u2019t have the willpower to stop yourself.\n\nThe worst of it, is that guilt quickly goes away as you walk up behind her while she\u2019s locking the door and quickly strip off her panties before taking her on all fours on the bed like you promised.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 fuck yeah. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d She pants as you enter inside her.\n\nThe session is quite unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s raw; it\u2019s passionate and practically animalistic.\n\nAnd that\u2019s saying something considering you used to have sex with a succubus.\n\nSomehow though, it\u2019s much different. With Tanya, she was always still dominant in some way. With this woman, it\u2019s\u2026well hard to describe.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve just longed for intimacy for so long, maybe it\u2019s the drugged drinks enhancing the pleasure to an unnatural degree, maybe it\u2019s the anonymity, maybe this girl is actually a magical fairy with a magical vagina, or maybe it\u2019s a combination of several factors.\n\nIn any case it\u2019s almost like your bodies are in perfect sync with each other. Like it feels so natural and right that you\u2019re achieving some sort of emotional and even spiritual fulfillment as well as a physical one.\n\nYou\u2019re so damn delirious that at one point in between the huffing and puffing and panting and dirty talk you suddenly blurt out:\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nAnd to your equal surprise:\n\n\u201cI love you too\u2026don\u2019t stop.\u201d She replies, followed by a pleasured moan.\n\nNeedless to say, you don\u2019t until you (and her) are completely spent.\n\nAt which point you collapse nearly directly on top of her and fall asleep or rather lose consciousness.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re out for, but when you wake up you\u2019re by yourself and there is no sign of the woman you were with.\n\nYou half wonder if you hallucinated her, but you see that there is a discarded mask so you\u2019re guessing she was actually here.\n\nYou slowly get up and rip your own mask off your face and look around for your clothes. While you\u2019re getting dressed you start feeling a sight ache all over your body. You feel drained in fact, almost reminds you of how you used to feel with your sessions with Tanya.\n\nBut that woman wasn\u2019t Tanya. Last night was just you and some beautiful stranger under the effects of a powerful aphrodisiac that pushed the limits of your endurance.\n\nAnd of course that beautiful stranger will soon be dead. Just as well as you never learned her name or even saw her face. Makes the fact that you just condemned her to death a lot easier to cope with. Not much that can be done anyway. At least she had fun; at least you believe she did given her squeals of ecstasy.\n\nYou stumble out of the room and find that several servants are cleaning up everywhere along with several disheveled noble types walking around half dressed and hung over. Nobody pays much attention to you and just goes about their own business as you make your way to exit the palace.\n\nAs you get to the front door of the palace you see Baroness Ludmilla standing nearby saying goodbye to all her guests that are staggering out. The baroness doesn\u2019t look any worse for wear. Either she didn\u2019t drink what everyone else did or she\u2019s got amazing recuperative powers. When she sees you, she waves you over.\n\n\u201cHello again! I was hoping to catch you before you left! And by your appearance, it looks like you had quite the experience last night! Hope it was fun for you!\u201d Ludmilla says.\n\u201cIt was different I can say that much. Have you seen Vera?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHm? Oh you mean the girl you came here with? No, I haven\u2019t seen her since the festivities were just getting started.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, guess I\u2019ll see her back home then.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s where she is. Goodbye and again I\u2019m glad you came. I\u2019m just sorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to talk more, but you know what? We should meet again sometime. Just us two. Talk about life and shit.\u201d\n\u201cUm, sure I guess. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nYou give a small bow to the Baroness, believing that you probably should show some sort of deference to her station. She seems to like that, and then you turn to leave because honestly you can\u2019t get out of there fast enough.\n\nIt\u2019s a long walk back home and you\u2019re thirsty as hell. Probably dehydrated from all the wild sex you had. Along the way you stop inside a tavern and order a drink. Nothing alcoholic this time though.\n\nWhen the tavern keeper pours you a cup of apple cider, you go to pay for it and find what little coin you had in your pocket is gone! You check you other pockets and still nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe this\u2026she fucking robbed me? Bitch!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cUm, sir?\u201d the tavern keeper says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you say still distracted by the fact that you can\u2019t believe you got robbed.\n\u201cI\u2026um\u2026 know who you are sir, and um, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d\n\nWell at least reputation has its benefits and now you\u2019re just irritated that you even spent any amount of energy feeling guilty about having sex with that thieving bitch.\n\nAfter drinking your fill and resting a moment, you eventually make your way back to the League headquarters where business is going on as usual. You ask various members if they\u2019ve seen Vera, eventually you bump into her and she answers herself. She doesn\u2019t look any worse for wear.\n\n\u201cHey boss. There you are. Guess you found the party a lot more interesting than I did after all. What happened to you?\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cNever mind all that. What happened to you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh shortly after we separated I wandered and talked to a few people and even looked around seeing if I could steal anything, but there really wasn\u2019t a good opportunity, and then something weird happened.\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess, everyone got all friendly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, REALLY friendly. Didn\u2019t know it was going to be that kind of party. Guessing something was in the drinks. Glad I hadn\u2019t drank anything while I was there. Still, I might have paired up with one of the horny aristocrat guys if it had just been a one on one thing, but then Ludmilla was around and she started hitting on me too and I got really creeped out. I mean she didn\u2019t know of course, but she could potentially be my half sister, and that just really put me out of the mood entirely. I ran out as soon as I could.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, potentially fucking a sibling, I can see where that would put a damper on things. Wish a damper was put on me last night.\u201d\n\u201cSo what DID happen to you? Did you get caught up in an orgy?\u201d Vera asks with a grin.\n\u201cNo, but I did spend the entire night fucking some woman who apparently robbed me after I passed out.\u201d\n\nVera starts immediately laughing at how someone like you fell prey to something like that.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, laugh it up.\u201d You grumble.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the fact you got caught like that is just hilarious.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYeah well, she\u2019s not getting too far.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know who she is?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Nah, I just have a strong feeling that fate is going to catch up to her. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to dwell on it anymore, let\u2019s just get to work. In fact before shit happened yesterday, I was thinking about potential expansion.\u201d\n\u201cWhere exactly? You thinking about getting a League chapter in the Delantium Kingdom?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026but probably not. For whatever reason the Ebony Claw Syndicate has not fucked with us. If we start going into their territory, that could change. However I was thinking we could physically expand where isn\u2019t a strong organized criminal presence.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s worth looking into, I\u2019ve got a suggestion of where we should.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYou ever heard of Jicol?\u201d\n\u201cThink I\u2019ve heard some of the Hessla pirates we deal with mention it sometimes. Don\u2019t know much though.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a port town west of Hessla and from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s wide open like a whore\u2019s legs. Nobody has tried to organize anything there and the city focuses so much on defending against potential pirate attacks that it doesn\u2019t have the heightened security like say Klyton does in recent years. I say we start there.\u201d\n\nLooks like you\u2019ve got a new prospect.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 3D2 Power Struggle\n\n\n\nYear 31\n\n\u201cWhen are they supposed to arrive again?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, lesee\u2026 the ECS rep is supposed to be here tomorrow by carriage.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cOkay. It\u2019s been what, like a decade that they haven\u2019t taken an interest in this place ever since they lost their chapter here, now all of a fucking sudden I\u2019m receiving letters and having to meet with their reps.\u201d\n\u201cBetter dat den assassin blades.\u201d\n\u201cI guess. Just wondering why now all of a sudden.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe itz our expansion inta Jicol? We\u2019s startin\u2019 ta get bigger, dat shit kinda draws tenshun. Probably shoulda stayed small.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a risk, I suppose. Then again they might have fucked with us anyway. At least now we\u2019re a little stronger. Speaking of which, maybe we should get some of Gloom\u2019s people here tonight as extra security until this visit is over. Might as well put that alliance we have to good use.\u201d\n\u201cGrh, I still don\u2019t trust dem shadow guyz. Dey used ta be allied wit da Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I know their faith is for the most part still chummy with the Syndicate, but ever since Shade split from the main faith, this particular temple seems to be independent and follow its own agenda. I guess we can get a feel of where their alliances lie at least. Sort of wish Vera was still around sometimes as an extra pair of hands and eyes, but she\u2019s more useful in Jicol. I think she needed the change of scenery anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHow iz things dere anyway?\u201d\n\u201cLast message I got from her she said there weren\u2019t any problems. Even starting to recruit a few of the locals there, which is good so we don\u2019t have to send any more people from here. Not to mention the profit she sent last month was the biggest yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou ever think she\u2019s skimmin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cVera? Nah, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s probably running something on the side for herself. Which is fine by me if she is. I\u2019d rather have her overlooking things there than anyone else.\u201d\n\nLater you go to the Temple of Fel to speak with Gloom about extra back up. Gloom as usual is always willing to assist you. You\u2019ve always felt Gloom was way too friendly to be a Felian (Even his name is ironic) but better cordial than hostile you suppose.\n\nOne thing you have noticed is that over the years, the Felians aren\u2019t quite the disciplined shadowy priests they once were. Not to say they wouldn\u2019t be formidable in a fight, but they definitely aren\u2019t like how they were under their previous leadership. Gloom wasn\u2019t even aware that the Syndicate was visiting. For a group that\u2019s generally known for being masters of secrets and such, they seem a bit out of the loop nowadays.\n\nAfter coming to an agreement with Gloom, you leave the temple and make your way back to your headquarters.\n\nThe next day the ECS representative arrives. As mentioned in the correspondence to you, you meet in a \u201cneutral\u201d location at a tavern called the Bloody Bandit (Warts was right, why don\u2019t more of these places have inviting names?)\n\nYou arrive with a few of the larger hobgoblins by your side. You weren\u2019t sure at first, but letting some of Wart\u2019s \u201cbuddies\u201d from the Spiderfang tribe join was a good idea. They aren\u2019t as big as an ogre or as muscular as an orc but they\u2019re just as ugly and mean enough to intimidate most.\n\nYou look around and notice that at least one of Gloom\u2019s people is here. There might be more, but if they are, they must be better at hiding themselves. In any case, you\u2019re satisfied that you have an advantage if it comes to a fight.\n\nThen you see who can only be who you\u2019re supposed to meet. A well dressed man with a thin mustache sitting all by himself and not looking very concerned about his surroundings. The fact that he\u2019s here by himself speaks of his confidence that he\u2019s either powerful enough to survive whatever you might have in store, or the consequences of him will be so severe that you won\u2019t even try. He\u2019s not drinking anything, but when he sees you he nods and waves you over. You tell your hobgoblin retinue to wait nearby and mentally prepare yourself.\n\nYou sit down and the man briefly smiles.\n\n\u201cWell, right on time. Always a good sign when someone is punctual. When I noticed the shadow blades come in here, I thought for a moment you were using some sort of weak psychological intimidation tactic and try to make me sweat while you came in late. Though I suppose you\u2019re just more concerned with security given your green buddies over there. Hobs are an unusual choice though. We usually use ogres or orcs, but then you use the savages you got access to right? I can appreciate a man who improvises. In any case, my name is Percy and I\u2019m sure you want to get to it.\u201d\n\u201cI do like to be direct.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. Oh I\u2019ve heard a lot about you actually. Don\u2019t know everything about you of course, but that\u2019s okay, a little mystery is always welcome. What do you say about mystery?\u201d\n\u201cNot a fan of it. I sort of prefer to know everything I can, so I\u2019m not caught off guard.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, and I knew that about you too! Maybe you\u2019re not so mysterious, but that\u2019s okay too!\u201d\n\nPercy pats your hand from across the table in his enthusiasm. Honestly, you don\u2019t know if the guy is flirting with you at this point. Maybe it\u2019s a tactic to try to make you uncomfortable, whatever it is, you stay stoic.\n\n\u201cSo what is it that the Syndicate wishes of the Nocturnal League?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAh that is the question isn\u2019t it? What DOES the Syndicate want? I bet ever since you heard from us, you\u2019ve been wondering. Is this a threat? Is this a deal? Is this an alliance? Is it a prelude to an attack? What COULD it be? Why has the Syndicate suddenly taken an interest in Holgard again after it abandoned it a decade ago? Well? Do YOU have any ideas?\u201d Percy asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m a cynic so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re here to say you\u2019re taking over and this is my one warning to get out of the way. At best, you\u2019ll want me to still stick around. At worst, you\u2019ve probably already poisoned me when you touched my hand.\u201d\n\nPercy laughs out loud.\n\n\u201cYou my friend have a very interesting imagination! I assure you, if we wanted you dead, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking right now. You are partially correct though.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking over.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cNo. Well not directly. We DO want you to stick around though. You see, we have done a little research on you. We know you came here years ago, we also know you were part of the Thieves\u2019 Guild here before that and were instrumental in its destruction which THEN led to you being part of the Syndicate chapter here. Before Rook apparently blundered and cocked everything up. During all that time though, up until you created this Nocturnal League, you at your core were a thief. A good one though from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get to do it much anymore.\u201d\n\u201cMm, so to sum up, we have a simple thief who survived the destruction of not one, but two organizations that held the most sway in the underworld here. You then went on to create your own organization, which is now the only game in town. You also apparently managed to leverage an alliance with the Temple of Fel here. That is an interesting one considering the faithful of Fel and the Syndicate have been allies for many decades. Intertwined one might even say.\u201d\n\u201cThis group is a little different.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. I believe the High Shadow back in Delantium has had some issues with this particular branch in general, but that\u2019s an internal matter on their end. In any case back to you, it\u2019s all very impressive for someone of humble origins and very unusual how it all seemed to work out in your favor. One might even think you planned everything\u2026 well either that or you had the gods on your side.\u201d\n\u201cNever really planned to be in the position I\u2019m currently in and the only god I\u2019ve ever gave a few words to is Yag and even then not much.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then he must be rolling well for you every time. Perhaps it is luck that drives success in this city after all. Strategy, logic and even simple might seem to eventually fail in this city. This place is has always been problematic ever since the late Baron Vlad Varsakken declared his independence from Delantium. Even when we had a chapter here, it was always the least profitable of all of our holdings even with all the corruption going on, so when the leadership finally collapsed here and the rest of the lower ranks scattered to the winds. People higher than myself decided to wash their hands of the whole thing, not unlike the Delantium Kingdom did before I guess. However, things change and one of those changes is you sharing in your obvious success.\u201d\n\nAnd here it is, the shakedown.\n\n\u201cI can see by your face you aren\u2019t pleased with that last statement, but I think you should look upon it as a compliment. Just think, YOU managed to do what the Syndicate could not. You made a success here with no competition and you built it all from the ground up. Granted you did use some of our people and even altered our product\u2026Purple Wish? Come on, we all know that\u2019s just an inferior version of Blue Dream, but it\u2019s probably for the best that you didn\u2019t try to rip us off directly. We might have very well sent assassins in that case.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cI had considered that, hence why I suggested changing the formula.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSee always thinking! Which is why a direct take over wouldn\u2019t be as efficient. I mean why come in here and stomp about establishing our dominance and wasting manpower and resources when you\u2019re here? A perfectly reasonable and intelligent man more than capable of running things and knowing to give us our due.\u201d\n\u201cAlso knowing I don\u2019t have choice in the matter either.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is ALWAYS choice! I just know you\u2019ll make the right one! I\u2019m going to give you a sum and you can tell me if it\u2019s fair or rip it up. What you can\u2019t do is negotiate though. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not here to do that.\u201d\n\nWith this statement, Percy suddenly takes a small piece of parchment out of his pocket and moves it across the table. You take it and look at it.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable, but it\u2019s not exactly something you\u2019d be looking forward to paying every month. Especially when you\u2019re already kicking bribes to the Holgard government.\n\nStill, you\u2019re getting a lot of leeway all things considered. For now you\u2019re going to accept. You can always figure something out later.\n\n\u201cVery well I accept.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood! I knew you would! You didn\u2019t get where you are by being an idiot! Now that business is over, I\u2019m going to be in the city a few more days before coming to see you again for the first payment. Now I know you\u2019re a busy man with busy people, so I don\u2019t expect you lot to see to me and I\u2019m more than capable of protecting myself. However, I would like some suggestions on where all the good spots to have fun and unwind are here.\u201d\n\nAfter giving Percy some suggestions he shakes your hand and thanks you before leaving. As for you, you don\u2019t feel like going back to work right away either. You dismiss your hob crew and tell the Felians to just go back to whatever it is they do since you just want a moment by yourself (Even if you are still in a tavern)\n\nWhile you\u2019re racking your brain on how to deal with this new situation, you get another visitor.\n\n\u201cTough day in the underworld?\u201d\n\nYou look and see a woman in Dorna robes. It\u2019s been awhile, but you recognize her immediately. It\u2019s Heather.\n\n\u201cHeather? This is unexpected. How did you know I was even here?\u201d You say.\n\u201cMagic is a very handy thing to be skilled in when locating someone. I\u2019ve been meaning to see you for a while now. In fact I was coming to see you today and I\u2019m glad I caught you when I did since it seems like you\u2019ve been meeting with others. Like that man from the Syndicate.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cYou seem to have a lot of interest in me all of a sudden. Is this personal, or did Elder Flynn send you on behalf of your temple?\u201d\n\u201cOh this is temple business, but Elder Flynn didn\u2019t send me. In fact he\u2019s no longer in charge. I am.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Did you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKill him? Oh no. There was a large magical disturbance last year at a known wizard\u2019s home miles outside Holgard. An old acquaintance of the Elder actually. Flynn, myself and several other high ranking members went to investigate and let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t go well and I was the only survivor. However it did mean there was now need of a new leader and since I still was the most experienced. I took charge. Well, took charge of the few that remained of our order at least.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Didn\u2019t know that. Then again you lot are always insular so I just assumed you were being bookworms as usual and never leaving your temple. I\u2019m surprised you told me that your temple isn\u2019t as strong as it once was. Still, I would have thought the Felians would at least have knowledge of this and been all over it, but then they\u2019re hardly the order they once were too.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that one, in fact that\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing you need a new ally and abandon your old ones.\u201d\n\u201cNew ally\u2026wait\u2026what, your people?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? We\u2019ve worked together before and obviously I trust you enough to reveal my temple\u2019s status to you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, which is why I\u2019m less than enthused. I mean no offense, but if your order only mainly consists of you and a few acolytes now, why would I abandon the Felians for you lot? This seems like you\u2019re just wanting to wipe out the Felians and you need my numbers to help you do it. And why now anyway? You two haven\u2019t had any problems. Even during the faith war here, you two didn\u2019t have any trouble.\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Felians DO know that we\u2019re currently weak and they\u2019ve already been conspiring to finish us off. Why they haven\u2019t revealed such info to your organization I couldn\u2019t say. Perhaps they felt that this didn\u2019t concern you or you wouldn\u2019t care. However, the shadow lurking fools are as you say, definitely not the order they once were. Even with our lesser strength we\u2019ve already fought off several assassination attempts. Still, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they DO ask for assistance and that\u2019s most likely going to be you\u2026or the Syndicate. They are back in this city are they not?\u201d\n\nNow this meeting just became a little more serious. Heather seems to know a lot about your situation, but then given that she\u2019s got magic coming out her ass, you aren\u2019t that surprised.\n\n\u201cYes, they are. What are you exactly proposing Heather?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe Fel temple is rogue in many ways. I don\u2019t propose to be an expert on their beliefs, but even I know that by breaking with its long time Syndicate alliance, it is only a matter of time before they are reabsorbed back into their faith\u2019s proper doctrine. That\u2019s either going to happen because we will eventually manage to do enough harm that they\u2019ll beg for help from their father temple in Delantium or they\u2019ll slowly be forced back into submission when the Syndicate eventually starts pushing their weight here. That is what they\u2019re doing aren\u2019t they?\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cSomewhat\u2026yes.\u201d\n\u201cMy proposal is this. WE ally against the Felians. They aren\u2019t going to expect an attack from you and you probably know when and where best to strike. We will provide back up of course to minimize the losses. In return you get allies that are much more powerful in the ways of magic and aren\u2019t likely to backstab you in the future. Our goal aren\u2019t the same, but don\u2019t conflict either, so I\u2019d say that already makes us better than the Felians.\u201d\n\u201cFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s say I agree to this. I still don\u2019t see how this helps me all that much. I\u2019m going to be taking most of the risk and damage and if anything the Syndicate might get a little suspicious if I start wiping out former allies.\u201d\n\u201cI think you and I both know they\u2019re going to be suspicious of you anyway, but if this helps, I will personally assist you in anyway I can in any matter. I mean maybe I never said this properly years ago, but I did appreciate that you turned down Elder Flynn\u2019s ritual suggestion. Not something I ever forgot.\u201d\n\nHeather looks at you with a mixture of anticipation and hopefulness. Perhaps even a bit of desperation. The fact that she\u2019s asking you at all says to you that she\u2019s not exactly confident that she\u2019ll win without your help.\n\nHonestly, you aren\u2019t sure about all this. While Heather has brought up some concerning points. The Felians ARE your allies and granted in this business such things can be fleeting, you start stabbing them in the back and where does it end? You also aren\u2019t so sure about replacing a solid known ally with an uncertain one, especially if they aren\u2019t exactly any better than the ones you have.\n\nGloom also hasn\u2019t really ever given you any reason to suddenly turn on him. Unless you\u2019re going to count the fact that his people never said they were waging a private war to finish off the Dornans. Then again, maybe Gloom considered it an internal matter and didn\u2019t feel the need to bother you with it.\n\nAnd the Syndicate just complicates matters. How are they going to react or will they even care at all? Percy did mention the temple here was frowned upon by the faithful in Delantium. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t matter if you wiped them out.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ally with Heather", "result": "The more you think about it, the more this makes sense in a ruthless pragmatic sort of way.\n\nThe temple of Fel here could very well become an arm of the Syndicate again, maybe not today or tomorrow, but when it happens, you\u2019re going to be in a much more dangerous position.\n\nYou still aren\u2019t exactly sure about the Dornans, but you\u2019re willing to give Heather the benefit of the doubt that she has genuine intentions. This still could all backfire of course, but you\u2019ll have to take that chance too.\n\nHowever, being an ally is a two way street and Heather did say she would help you in any way she could.\n\n\u201cOkay Heather, I\u2019m going to risk this, but as a show of good will I\u2019m going to need something from you too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course. What is it?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a representative from the Syndicate here as you know. Now I have to pay him an amount of coin that I don\u2019t particularly want to before he leaves in a few days.\u201d\n\u201cWait, so you want me to kill him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you probably would be better equipped since I do have reason to believe that he\u2019s probably highly skilled in shadow magic. While maybe with a bit of preparation my people could take him since he\u2019s alone, but it wouldn\u2019t be pretty. However, that wouldn\u2019t really solve my problem. The Syndicate would just rightfully assume I killed him and then have good reason to be pissed at me and that wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you asking exactly?\u201d\n\u201cAny way you could alter his mind or something similar?\u201d\n\u201cWell there are spells that can do all sorts of things, but again, did you have an idea of what you wanted exactly?\u201d\n\nYou and Heather start to discuss each other\u2019s plans. Your situation with Percy is easy enough Heather says, and assures you that she will be able to implement something with the help of her people.\n\nGloom and his people will be a little more difficult, but the pair of you come up with something that should work. It\u2019ll just require a little bullshit on your part, but you\u2019ve been doing that for so long that you\u2019re definitely an expert in it. In any event, you\u2019re going to go meet with Gloom while Heather plans to ambush Percy.\n\nThe next day you head to the Temple of Fel. Several Felians don\u2019t even seem to be bothered by your intrusion, which would be a much different story if Shade or his predecessors were running things.\n\nWhen one of them asks what your business is at the temple, you simply tell them that you wish to see Gloom at which point they go check to see if he\u2019s available and fortunately he is so you can get this over with today hopefully. (Along with it going smoothly)\n\nYou walk through the dark temple and eventually to Gloom\u2019s chambers where he sits writing something. When you enter he smiles and greets you. (You\u2019ve always found his general friendly personality to not quite match his name, let alone his faith)\n\n\u201cCome in, come in, I was just finishing up my latest sermon. Have my faithful been providing an adequate job with your extra security? There haven\u2019t been any issues have there?\u201d Gloom asks.\n\u201cNo, not at all. In fact I was going to tell you I won\u2019t be needing them after all, seems I overreacted with the Syndicate visit.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cAh, I see. Well better safe than sorry. So how did your meeting with the Syndicate go?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than I hoped. Worse than I feared. So has the Syndicate been to see you?\u201d\n\u201cUs? No. I don\u2019t see why they would. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I figured while the Syndicate isn\u2019t making a direct threatening presence, I figure they might still be snooping about and trying to stir up animosity between allies.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes I can see where that would be a concern, but I assure you we have no dealings with them even if the Temple of Fel has been considered the Syndicate\u2019s traditional ally. As you know while we are faithful to Fel, we believe in following our own path. We are your allies, not the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cYes, this particular temple has been engaged in the concept of flexibility for quite some time now. And I appreciate your dedication to our partnership, which is why I\u2019m puzzled that you did not ask for our help on your own matter.\u201d\n\u201cOur matter?\u201d\n\u201cWell your attempt to wipe out the Dornans of course.\u201d\n\nGloom drops his friendly persona, though not to a hostile expression, but more of a serious one.\n\n\u201cI considered that as a private conflict between faith and saw no reason to bother you with it, I know you\u2019re very busy and all. Though I do wonder how you found out about it, since we\u2019ve very good about keeping this quiet. The Baroness would come down on everyone if the two remaining religious factions in the city were openly fighting in the streets.\u201d Gloom says.\n\u201cBecause the leader of the Dornans came to me yesterday begging for an alliance. She wants me to turn on you. She even gave me one of these again.\u201d\n\nYou pull out a solid black orb causing Gloom\u2019s eyes to widen. He remembers a similar magic object was used during the final battle with the Joachimites. You continue to speak quickly before Gloom makes any rash moves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry my friend, obviously I\u2019m not here for treachery. Besides, I\u2019m here by myself. Even without your magic I would never succeed so it would be a pretty poor plan indeed. I am however giving it to you. Just like I gave this to Shade when we fought the Inquisitor. Here you go.\u201d\n\nGloom warily looks at you as he slowly takes the orb. When he finally grabs it, he seems to relax a little more, but he\u2019s definitely not comfortable. Still he hasn\u2019t killed you yet, so that\u2019s a good sign. Meanwhile you\u2019re doing your best to remain calm yourself under these conditions, so you continue to speak.\n\n\u201cI have to say I was a little surprised that the Dornan high priestess came to me though. I figured with all their magic they would be more than able to take care of themselves.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a vulnerable state so they need all the help they can get right now. However, they\u2019re still very dangerous. In fact I thought that with their new leadership, they would soon collapse altogether, but as it turned out they have proved more resilient than I thought. They\u2019re attempting to rebuild and I\u2019m not just talking about their numbers, I\u2019m talking about their influence in this city.\u201d Gloom remarks.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe Dornan high priestess or matriarch as her followers call her now, has made steps in meeting with Baroness Varsakken over the past few months. She obviously intends on gaining favor with Ludmilla and eventually get rid of us and that can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Didn\u2019t know that, but isn\u2019t the Baroness a dedicated follower of Fel?\u201d\n\u201cEh, the Baroness has always been a dabbler. Her faith in Fel isn\u2019t the most dedicated. Indeed she probably has always been more interested in learning shadow magic rather than revering Fel. Still, it was useful to have ruler that was friendly towards us. Unfortunately the new Dornan leadership seems have opened their own doors to teaching the ways of magic and Ludmilla is all too eager to jump on such an offer even if it means paying lip service to both gods.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t one of these divine beings eventually punish Ludmillia for her fickle nature?\u201d you say mildly jokingly.\n\u201cPerhaps, but it my experience the gods do things in their own time and as a mortal I can\u2019t wait that long. In any case it would seem that perhaps Fel has assisted in the more direct destruction of the immediate threat that are the Dornans.\u201d\n\nGloom examines the orb in his hand after his statement before continuing.\n\n\u201cSo what exactly was the plan anyway? How did she even trust you enough?\u201d Gloom asks.\n\u201cOh, she was trying to prey upon my paranoia with the Syndicate, claiming that you would eventually turn against me and other shit. Also during that whole getting Dornan help against the Joachimites, I fucked her once.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTruly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the Elder at the time was being sort of a dick to her and I bumped into her crying about it. Seeing an opportunity, I sort of reassured her of her worth and well you know how women fall for that sort of thing. One thing lead to another and I think she\u2019s always been a little sweet on me after that. As for the plan, I was supposed to just come in here with my people, break the orb so you couldn\u2019t use any magic and then make sure all of you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cHm, she might as well have placed her faith in Dorna rather than you for all good either would do her. The Dornans do have powerful magic to be sure, but they are poor fighters. Evening the odds with this object and they stand no chance. I\u2019m going to personally enjoy this I believe and you\u2019ve proven that our alliance is indeed a strong one. We will strike their temple in force. I want to make sure none escape, then we\u2019ll destroy it.\u201d\n\u201cDid you want the League\u2019s assistance?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done enough already and I never even asked for it. I see now that I probably should have though. I believe we can do this ourselves, however if you still wish to help, I will not turn it down.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there with a few of my people. Couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nGloom tells you that he\u2019ll organize an attack in a few days, you tell him that works for you since you have some other business to attend to.\n\nA couple days pass and that other business finally comes to pass and this is what you\u2019ve been more concerned about.\n\nYou meet Percy at the same tavern with the payment. Once again he\u2019s very friendly.\n\n\u201cOn time as usual. Very glad that you value promptness as I am in a bit of a hurry. I believe I may have had too much fun here and I should be getting back. I thank you for your suggestions on where to go.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cNo problem, so will you be back next month at this time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cProbably not me, but someone will. Probably of much lesser importance of course. I was just here this time to extend the hand and make the deal as it were. Still glad we came to one.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I agree. Better for business all around.\u201d\n\u201cYes! Yes exactly!\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, I have your payment. Um, just so we\u2019re clear how much was it again?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on now. You trying one last try at lowering the price? I told you I wasn\u2019t here to haggle. You know it was a thousand gold pieces.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I knew, and I have it here. Just a poor attempt at a joke I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well jokes are fine, but never about the Syndicate business. I hope you remember that.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\nYou have two of your hobgoblin muscle show Percy a large chest of gold to which he nods and you tell them to load it on the carriage outside.\n\n\u201cAnd with that, our business is concluded. I bid you good day and wish you well in your future endeavors, especially if it\u2019s going to make the Syndicate money!\u201d\n\nPercy stands up, shaking your hand and leaves.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe that worked. You don\u2019t know what the hell Heather did to him, but he actually believed he only asked you for a thousand gold monthly payment as opposed to the much larger sum he asked before.\n\nYou can imagine his superiors are going to be upset, but it won\u2019t be at you, it\u2019ll be at him for fucking up a deal that they\u2019re stuck with now. Well at least you hope they won\u2019t try to re-negotiate immediately. You\u2019ve bought yourself a little more time at least.\n\nMeanwhile, you still have to go stab the Felians in the back though you\u2019re sort of wondering about still going through with that now what you\u2019ve heard about Heather cozying up to the Baroness.\n\nSeems like now more than ever she\u2019s attempting to use you as a pawn. Granted she was allying with you for mutual benefit before, but this seems a little different now. What exactly is she planning?\n\nThen again, if she is getting friendly with the Baroness, is it really going to make a difference to you? And Heather did just come through for you on the Syndicate thing.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stick with the deal", "result": "One double cross is enough for now, no need to complicate matters. Besides, regardless of Heather\u2019s own agenda, she\u2019s probably not wrong about the Felians.\n\nGoing to be interesting when you see the look on Gloom\u2019s face when he realizes the orb you gave him doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe night of the attack comes and you meet with Gloom just a few blocks away from the Dornan Temple, you have your usual hob retinue with you. (You\u2019re really getting used to having these guys around nowadays) Gloom is with a few of his own people, but even without magic powers you can sense some are probably nearby in the shadows.\n\n\u201cOnce again, glad that this is a joint effort though I don\u2019t think it was necessary to bring as many people with you as you did. The orb is going to nullify all magic and when that happens, those Dornan priests aren\u2019t going to be much match for us.\u201d Gloom says.\n\u201cYeah, well I want to be on the safe side. My people are going to remain outside anyway, you know just in case any try to escape. I\u2019ll come in with your people. Speaking of which are you really bringing them all?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, this is something that\u2019s been a long time coming and nobody who is a true follower of Fel should miss out on. Honestly, it was foolish to believe they wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Shadow Master Shade warned me to always watch them you know, just before he died. A few of his interpretations of the faith may have been a bit too restrictive, but he had his own wisdom on practical matters.\u201d\n\u201cWell, after tonight, you won\u2019t need to worry about watching them ever again.\u201d\n\nWith those last words all of you march towards the temple. The few wanderers still outside in the area immediately go find shelter when they see a group of mean looking hobgoblins and Felians walking down the street.\n\nThe Dornan Temple doesn\u2019t even have their usual lookout standing outside, though you imagine the Dornans have some sort of magical detection going on and this plan has already been expected.\n\nGloom blasts the temple\u2019s doors off their hinges with a dark magic bolt of some sort. Then he takes the lead, you tell your hobgoblins to stand guard outside and kill anyone who tries to escape. They faithfully obey and you enter with the crowd of Felians that are entering the temple, staying close to the back of course.\n\nHeather and her much smaller group are already there to meet the Felians.\n\n\u201cIt ends today and the faith of Fel will rule supreme in the city at last!\u201d Gloom shouts and throws down the orb. A bit more dramatic than you\u2019d expect from a Felian, but then Gloom\u2019s whole attack tonight is a bit more theatrical than a typical Felian would go about this. Good thing too, since if he behaved more like his predecessors he wouldn\u2019t be going in so recklessly like this.\n\nNo sooner has Gloom made his announcement, a white light washes over the room and suddenly all of Gloom\u2019s previously shadow cloaked people are now visible. Naturally Gloom just assumes this is just the effects of the orb, but he\u2019s soon very surprised to learn that the Dornans have not lost any of their magic abilities at all.\n\nSeveral of them are incinerated instantly by Dornan spells. Gloom himself manages to cut down a single acolyte before he\u2019s finally brought down by some spell that causes him to age rapidly and then fall over dead.\n\nThey may be a small group, but this temple is where their magic is the most powerful and you\u2019re getting to witness a lot of it first hand, you\u2019re just glad you\u2019re not on the receiving end.\n\nWhile the remaining Felians realize that this is a lost cause and attempt to run, you do you part in shooting a few of them while your hob crew enthusiastically cuts down these lesser Felians that have more fear than fight left in them.\n\nA Holgard watch patrol shows up, but doesn\u2019t intervene, instead they just turn right back around, probably thinking they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with this level of conflict.\n\nSoon, it\u2019s all over and the Felians are no more as a force in this city and you\u2019re just hoping you made the right choice in allies. Heather commands her people to start cleaning up the bodies before she goes over to speak to you. She looks a little worn and tired, but then you guess magic takes its toll just as much as regular combat.\n\n\u201cTold you the plan would work as long as you got them in here.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cYeah, thankfully Gloom was a trusting fool and practically a heretic of his own faith which generally goes about things in a much subtler manner.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI suppose that did make things easier. Thanks again for you help on this. The expression on Gloom\u2019s face was priceless when he realized the orb didn\u2019t work!\u201d\n\u201cMm, didn\u2019t see it, I was just concerned about not getting caught in the cross fire of a stray magic missile or possible a Felian blade after realizing they had been had.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you never in any true danger. Even if you had gotten wounded we could have easily fixed you up with healing magic.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say\u2026well in any case I certainly hope you\u2019re as chummy with the Baroness as you\u2019re supposed to be, because this little fight did attract attention and last I heard any open fighting between the religious faiths was frowned upon. Not to mention the League was involved and I certainly down want repercussions of this to cause my organization to suffer for it.\u201d\n\nHeather looks at you as if you weren\u2019t supposed to know her dealings with the Baroness.\n\n\u201cKnow about that do you?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cGloom might have mentioned it. He never elaborated and what you were talking about with her, but I get the impression he didn\u2019t know and just feared a power grab and wanted to strike first before you had the whole city worshipping Dorna.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI see. His sudden attacks make a lot more sense now, though if he had come to me directly, we probably could have even come to an agreement.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it. He was still very dedicated to Fel even if he wasn\u2019t a stickler for doctrine.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just it, my conversations with the Baroness weren\u2019t about religious faith. They were about magic in general. I was urging that she should seriously consider setting up a magic school here. Especially since I know she\u2019s very interested in the subject.\u201d\n\u201cA magic school?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? The Delantium Kingdom has a very well established university; even Klyton has a small one. Surely a city as large as Holgard is worthy of one.\u201d\n\u201cI guess? Little bit out of my area of expertise. So wait, you aren\u2019t planning on making Dorna the only goddess to worship in the city?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I mean that seems to be a side effect of all this, but honestly I don\u2019t care who worships what. I believe the pursuit of keeping magic alive is more important than worship at this point. I\u2019m not sure if you realize it, but magic isn\u2019t exactly a common thing nowadays and has been in decline. In a couple hundred years after the last few powerful wizards die out, what then? Dorna is a the goddess of magic and knowledge, I can better serve her through teaching rather than just worship.\u201d\n\nSort of an interesting goal you weren\u2019t expecting from Heather. Not really one that directly interferes with your own business either, perhaps it could even be a new opportunity, if it ever gets off the ground.\n\nHeather goes on to say that she will of course smooth all this over with Ludmilla and more importantly make sure there are no repercussions for the League.\n\nA couple weeks pass and sure enough, you haven\u2019t been harassed by the Holgard Watch (Well within reason).\n\nAfter a month rolls around a Syndicate collector comes by and asks for the thousand, very no-nonsense and anxious to be on his way. When you name drop Percy, just to see if you can get any information on what might have happened to him, the rep says he doesn\u2019t even know the man. You pay him with the chest full of coin and he\u2019s on his way. Nothing else is mentioned or happens.\nMeanwhile one of the requests to Heather is asking if she can figure out a way to lift your curse. She says she doesn\u2019t know other than the ritual Elder Flynn suggested that time and apparently he never did give the exact details about what it all entailed as far as the words to say and such. (And she\u2019s not exactly keen on bringing up the other known detail you both know about)\n\nHowever, she says she still has a lot of his notes and writing to go through, so she will try to find out how to do it and perhaps maybe there are other ways to lift it as well.\n\nLooks like you picked your new allies wisely. Hopefully this all proves to be even more useful in the future.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\nIt\u2019s been awhile, but it\u2019s good to see Vera again even if she\u2019s just here for a visit. She\u2019s got some strong opinions on some of the changes that have happened recently though.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe the Felians are gone completely. I mean I just remember them always being here. Then again, so were a lot of groups I suppose. Still, sort of surprised you managed to gain an alliance with the Dornans.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why it\u2019s really all that surprising. Heather helped us in the past and she\u2019s running things now. The Dornans aren\u2019t even very religious anymore; they turned their temple into a school of sorts. Don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got many takers yet though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm. I\u2019m also still a little concerned about what you did with the Syndicate though. Might have been better in the long run to just pay their price.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me Vera? You didn\u2019t see what they were trying to extort from us. Besides, we\u2019ve been okay so far and they haven\u2019t even suddenly tried to raise the rate.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I know you have a lucky habit of getting over on the Syndicate, but I feel like this is pushing it. I have to think they must know something, but they\u2019re biding their time to lull you into a false sense of security before they strike.\u201d\n\u201cOh trust me, ever since I stepped foot into this city, I\u2019ve been on my guard constantly. Don\u2019t really know any other way to live at this point. However I\u2019m going to soon be hiring a lot of cheap muscle in the form of all the hobgoblins, so I\u2019m slightly less concerned about the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t seriously be considering recruiting MORE hobs.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? They\u2019ll actually be perfect for this. Most of them either come here just itching to break someone\u2019s legs or they go join the fight arena. Though a few odd ones join the Holgard Watch instead, go figure.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019ve noticed a severe increase in hobs in this organization since I came back to Holgard. Just don\u2019t want this place turning into the Roach Leg Tribe.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Spiderfang Tribe actually and they\u2019re still far outnumbered for that to happen. Well, for now at least. In any case, most of them have been migrating to Holgard quite a bit over the years. I guess most are learning that city life isn\u2019t all that bad and you can still be just as much of a violent asshole here as you can out in the wild and get routinely paid for it. Hmm, actually, now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I guess it makes sense that a few of them join the Holgard Watch after all.\u201d\n\u201cWell your call I guess, at least I don\u2019t have deal with them. Dealing with Warts was enough for me. Though I\u2019m not convinced a bunch of unruly hobs are going to be the end all of extra protection.\u201d\n\u201cHence why we\u2019re also close allies to a group of wizards.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem pretty confident in our new wizard allies. Just how friendly are you with this Heather? I mean are you fucking her or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not actually.\u201d\n\u201cAh, so you\u2019re TRYING to fuck her.\u201d\n\u201cActually I\u2019m not, but I\u2019m not sure what difference it would make to you if I was.\u201d\n\u201cNone I suppose, though I was just trying to figure out what might have been the motivator to throw your lot in with trusting this sorceress and her adepts. But if you say it was purely a practical and strategic move for the good of the League, then that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of fucking, who was that big dark skinned guy who you were reluctant to leave when you were getting off the ship?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Zamed. He\u2019s the captain of the Traveler. He\u2019s a Hessla pirate, we tend to have business with a lot of them in Jicol, but Zamed\u2019s been about the only one I\u2019ve really taken a shine to lately. Still, it\u2019s just as well as he\u2019s a pirate. Don\u2019t think I\u2019d want him around ALL the time. Best to keep these sort of things free and flexible.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Though I thought Jicol was supposed to be pirate free.\u201d\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s pirate free in that the city doesn\u2019t have to worry about them ever attacking the place, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t stop there for supplies as long as they behave. Besides, Zamed\u2019s been more of a privateer recently, though I suppose it\u2019s a thin line. He\u2019s been doing a lot of work for the Delantium Kingdom in their war against Nichan. Which is something I sort of want to bring up with you because it could possibly affect the League.\u201d\n\u201cWell guess I better hear it then.\u201d\n\nVera takes a drink of the rum she\u2019s brought with her from Jicol before continuing.\n\n\u201cOkay, I guess I\u2019ll start at the beginning. Let\u2019s see\u2026what do you know of Peter Varsakken? Youngest son of Vlad.\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cUm, nothing actually. Didn\u2019t know there was another one of Vlad\u2019s spawn running around. Wait, is this another one of his bastards, like you?\u201d you ask with a smirk.\n\u201cOh no. He\u2019s very much legitimate. It\u2019s just that after he had a disagreement with his father and fled the city, all records were pretty much erased of him. He\u2019s basically been living in exile in the Delantium Kingdom. Peter\u2019s disagreement with his father involved the whole breaking away from the Delantium Kingdom in the first place. Peter was the only one who saw it as treason and remained loyal to Delantium. Over the years Peter has been trying to amass an army to take back the city.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that the Delantium Kingdom hasn\u2019t exactly been in a big hurry to retake this place. I mean it\u2019s been decades hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019ve been sort of busy with other things, like their recent war with Nichan for example. While the ruling class over there doesn\u2019t want to spend their resources and treasury to take this place back, they certainly won\u2019t turn down someone else willing to do the job, and that\u2019s where Peter comes in. He\u2019s of noble birth, loyal to the kingdom and would be an excellent governor for this city and absorb it back into Delantium\u2019s fold.\u201d\n\u201cI see, and how do you know all this?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said Zamed has been privateering for the Delantium Kingdom and he was contacted by Peter who is still trying to amass a conquering force of men and ships to take back his birthright. In fact Zamed is supposed to be organizing the majority of a flotilla of Hessla privateers\u201d\n\u201cAnd you trust this pirate?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, but I trust the fact that I know how to lay it down good enough that he told me all this stuff in the bedroom without me even asking.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t need details on that part.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, Peter\u2019s been at this for years ever since he got exiled. He\u2019s suffered many set backs in his quest to retake Holgard. Every time he\u2019s been on the verge of being ready, something has happened. This was partially thanks to the Ebony Claw Syndicate sabotaging his efforts in Delantium, and sometimes even the Temple of Fel would hinder his efforts as well. However, since things have changed drastically over the years in this city, he\u2019s in the best position he\u2019s ever been in to retake this place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think he won\u2019t get sabotaged again by either group? I mean the Ebony Claw might not have a direct presence here, but they\u2019re still making some coin from us. Same is some what true of the Felians, though different reasons. They\u2019re allies with the ECS, so they tend to help them.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they care this time. I mean thanks to your magical shenanigans they don\u2019t make enough from us for it to make much difference either way I suppose. If the League suffers severely from this invasion, the ECS will most likely just come in directly and finish it off.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s presumptuous that we\u2019re going to get the shit kicked out of us. As long as we don\u2019t stand toe to toe with an invading force and stay out of the damn way, I imagine we\u2019ll get through it. Hell, it isn\u2019t like we don\u2019t have routes out of the city if need be. Honestly though unless this Peter is bringing the full force of the Delantium army, I don\u2019t see him winning. Ludmilla counts wizards among her allies and has a strong fleet of her own, so I question if this Peter is even going to succeed. And say Peter does win, then what? Is this guy some law and order fanatic? He\u2019s a Varsakken and from what I can tell every single one of their family members are corrupt. So it would just be a matter of coming to an understanding with him so business continues as usual.\u201d\n\u201cWell that might be easier to do if we dealt with him now then. In fact I sort of wanted to address that idea.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\nVera goes into the explanation that from the information she\u2019s gathered from Zamed, Peter is most likely going to win. While he doesn\u2019t have the Delantium army at his command, he does have several orc mercenary companies along with a few wizards that he\u2019s managed to make friends with from the Delantium magic university.\n\nShe also has heard that while Peter isn\u2019t exactly a Joachimite purity zealot, his time in the Delantium Kingdom has probably given him more of an appreciation for a more orderly society as opposed to one that embraces rampant corruption so readily. So he\u2019s most likely not going to look favorably upon the Nocturnal League.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s still pragmatic enough that he\u2019d probably give leniency to a group that actively helped him and a deal could very well be made as you said. Vera goes on to say she truly believes that this is the best chance for the Nocturnal League to survive in Holgard.\n\n\u201cYou seem to have given this some thought, and while I do often appreciate your input on things, the one problem I have in this case is you\u2019re getting all of this information second hand from a pirate. Now I know you said your vertical smile caused the guy to go all stupid over you, so you\u2019re certain he\u2019s on the up and up. However, HIS information might also be mixed with rumors, half-truths and outright lies that he\u2019s overheard. I mean if you were fucking Peter Varsakken himself and getting this information from him, I might believe the situation is as hopeless as you\u2019re saying.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI thought you might feel that way, so how about this then\u2026Peter Varsakken is meeting Zamed. We could go to this meeting as well and we could hash out our demands.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cWait. You\u2019re telling me that you were planning on going to meet with this Peter without me?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Of course not! I came here first because I wanted to see what your decision would be on this. I mean look, I understand what you\u2019re saying, but based on everything I\u2019ve learned, the outcome seems grim even if we managed to keep our head down during the initial invasion. But, you\u2019re right too, I am getting all this information second hand, so maybe it would be a good idea to actually talk with this Peter in person, before coming to any sort of decision. If we did, you and I could both make an assessment of whether to throw our lot in or not.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026(Sigh) yeah I suppose it couldn\u2019t hurt, though I\u2019m just wondering about the people we already have alliances with. I mean pissing off the Holgard magic school isn\u2019t something I exactly want to do, also you mentioned the ECS has been thwarting this guy\u2019s efforts for a long time, and I\u2019m still not convinced that they won\u2019t still do that even if they haven\u2019t done it yet. By siding with Peter, we could piss them off which wouldn\u2019t be any good either.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s your call I suppose boss. I just don\u2019t want us to get swept away in the flood of this upcoming conflict. I want to see us survive.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure we all want that.\u201d\n\nYou swear if it isn\u2019t a rebellion or faction war, it\u2019s a fucking invasion in this city. It\u2019s enough to make you want to pick up and just leave everything behind rather than deal with this shit. However, you\u2019ve built something here, so you\u2019re not doing that until all else fails.\n\nWhether or not you can strike a good deal with Peter or not, there is one very personal reason you\u2019d prefer to stay loyal to your current allies and that\u2019s the fact that so far Heather is your only sure lead on getting fixed from your curse. If you backstab them and live, you\u2019re still fucked because there goes a potential cure. It\u2019s selfish, but it\u2019s a pretty strong motivator.\n\nWhile Vera has said that Peter has wizard connections as well, that\u2019s not a sure thing that you can get help from them. They\u2019re assisting Peter and have no reason to do the same for you.\n\nAbout the only thing you can do is try to see if Heather and her people might join Peter\u2019s invasion. Hell, if that\u2019s the case then you\u2019d definitely be willing to help Peter as well.\n\nOf course doing that might not go over well either and you\u2019d tip your hand pretty severely. Might be better to talk to Peter first and get all the information from him and then go speak to Heather so you\u2019d at least have something that might be useful to her if worse came to worst in your meeting.", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk to Heather first", "result": "Maybe you\u2019re a little paranoid but you don\u2019t feel comfortable going to a meeting in unfamiliar territory with someone who you know virtually nothing about save for what Vera\u2019s managed to tell you. Peter could see this as an opportunity to take you out as a potential obstacle to his conquest. Vera by herself on the other hand is less of a target, not to mention she\u2019s got a pirate boyfriend with her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to this meeting, however since you\u2019re so friendly with this Zamed and he\u2019s going anyway, you can continue to accompany him. Then you can come back here and tell me what you think.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go yourself? I would have thought this would be something so important that you\u2019d want to directly deal with it.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cWhile it would be nice to just have unlimited power to deal with everything directly, I\u2019ve got a bunch of shit to take care of here. I trust that you\u2019ll be fine and I trust you\u2019ll be able to assess the situation and give me proper feedback of our best options.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. That\u2019s a lot of confidence in me, boss.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if I didn\u2019t trust you, I wouldn\u2019t have put you in charge of our chapter at Jicol, which obviously has been thriving under your management. You\u2019ve always been an asset to the Nocturnal League\u2026and hell you\u2019re probably one of the few people I consider a friend.\u201d\n\nVera looks a bit moved by your words. Honestly, you didn\u2019t really plan to say something like that, but it felt right under the circumstances. Vera nods and agrees with your words and then moves in to hug you which you return.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a longer than average hug and it\u2019s pretty obvious that there has always been a little something there between the two of you, but thanks to your curse you\u2019ve never tried to pursue it. Vera herself probably believes that you\u2019re just not interested in her that way at this point.\n\nWhat might have been you suppose, but then again who knows? You still hold out hope that you\u2019ll get cured one day so the future isn\u2019t set in stone yet.\n\nBut first things first and that\u2019s preparing for this invasion and how you\u2019re going to go about it.\n\nAfter seeing Vera off, you go to the Temple of Dorna, which of course has now been transformed, into a school. Still looks practically the same and there still aren\u2019t many people in the place. Seems that not many have taken advantage of the chance to learn magic, or more likely, nobody in this scum-ridden city has the talent for it. (Or the money)\n\nYou don\u2019t get far before you\u2019re stopped by two teenagers.\n\n\u201cHey you, this isn\u2019t a fucking Purple Wish Den! This place is for wizards only!\u201d a pimply faced young man says. The young woman with him gives you a dirty look with an amused sneer.\n\n\u201cIt is? I thought it was a brothel. Good thing it isn\u2019t though because I don\u2019t need a blowjob that badly.\u201d You say, then you look over at the girl with him.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019d be okay after a couple ales.\u201d\n\u201cHEY! That\u2019s my girlfriend, you asshole!\u201d\n\u201cOh? Well I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate someone taking longer than two minutes for a change.\u201d\n\u201cEw! Fucking perv! You think you\u2019re funny? You won\u2019t be so funny after I set your balls on fire.\u201d The young woman says.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got the crotch rot then, okay then I\u2019ll pass. Look, while all this has been amusing, I\u2019m not here for either one of you snotnosed brats, I\u2019m here to see Heather.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Grand Matriarch to you and I don\u2019t see why she\u2019d want to see you at all.\u201d\n\nBefore you can respond, the pimply man suddenly points a finger at you and zaps you in the chest with a lightning bolt! Well lighting bolt isn\u2019t exactly the right word, since you aren\u2019t exactly knocked on your ass, but it is a tiny jolt that catches off guard and it did hurt.\n\n\u201cOW!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cYeah! How ya like that goblin fucker? You mess with us an, SHIT! AAARGH!\u201d the young man starts to say before you grab his finger which he was still pointing at you and break it.\n\nLike the sissy he is, he breaks down crying on the floor clutching his broken finger, meanwhile you\u2019ve already drawn your pistol on the teenage girl.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it sweetheart. I can pull this trigger before you can utter an incantation.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat in Dorna\u2019s name is going on here?\u201d a voice shouts.\n\nYou look away briefly and see Heather with a couple of other wizard behind her.\n\n\u201cApologies Heather, but\u2026well fuck, these two pissed me off and I didn\u2019t have time for their bullshit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cObviously. Cooper! Gwen! Step away from that man. I told you two before to never mistake your magic for invincibility. And that mindset works even more against you when you insist on being within reach of the head of the Nocturnal League. He could have very well killed the pair of you before I even showed up.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cShit, you\u2019re the leader of the infamous League? Um, we\u2019re sorry we didn\u2019t mean anything!\u201d Gwen says.\n\u201cGwen, stop groveling and take your boyfriend to go practice your healing magic for a change.\u201d\n\nAs Gwen picks her sniveling boyfriend off the floor, Heather tells the other wizards behind her to return to their lessons and approaches you.\n\n\u201cI swear, I could make life a living hell for that girl and she apologizes to you rather than me.\u201d Heather says shaking her head.\n\u201cWell she probably knows you aren\u2019t going to kill her, meanwhile I was pointing a gun at her head.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMeh, knowing that one, she\u2019ll probably develop a fantasy about you. She\u2019s got a thing for bad boys.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the one with the broken finger is a bad boy?\u201d\n\u201cClosest thing to one around here I suppose. Anyway, thanks for not doing any major damage to them, I don\u2019t have many students as it is. Now I assume you\u2019re here to see me, so let\u2019s head to my office.\u201d\n\nYou follow Heather to her office, which of course resembles more of a lab, however its kept in a much more organized manner than when you were in Elder Flynn\u2019s lab.\n\nHeather sits down and moves some papers and books around on her desk while addressing you.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten you and our deal, just so you know. I just haven\u2019t made much progress on searching for a way to lift your curse. I did find Elder Flynn\u2019s notes on the subject when you came in here, but honestly he was a little sketchy on the details concerning the curse part. Though I imagine once your ex was called in and bound, she would be able to be commanded to lift whatever curse she put on you. Still, he was probably more concerned with capturing a demon than curing you and after reading what would have happened to me, I\u2019m even happier that you declined the ritual.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. You wouldn\u2019t want sex with me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually not the part I\u2019m talking about. In fact if it were JUST that, I\u2019d be willing to get naked with you while my highly trained assistants performed the incantations for the ritual right now. However, what the Elder neglected to mention is the fact that this ritual would result in the poor girl\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, your succubus ex, wouldn\u2019t just be summoned forth into this world, she\u2019d be brought forth into the body of the girl you\u2019d be having sex with.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean like possession?\u201d\n\u201cI mean like the girl would literally explode into chunks gore and blood, when your ex arrived and chances are your ex wouldn\u2019t be too happy with you either and you probably wouldn\u2019t have much time to get out of her immediate vicinity before she killed you too.\u201d\n\u201cShit\u2026that\u2019s fucked up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. And I would have been willing to just go along with it, not knowing shit. By Dorna was I a fucking fool back then. Anyway, I hope this news isn\u2019t too disappointing for you.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s a bit disheartening\u2026however I wasn\u2019t even here about that.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and since there\u2019s no other way to say it, I\u2019m going to just be right up front with you, like you were up front with me.\u201d\n\nYou explain everything you\u2019ve learned about Peter Varsakken\u2019s invasion, which immediately catches Heather\u2019s attention. You don\u2019t go into detail about sending one of your people to meet with Peter, but you do ask the direct question if she\u2019s supporting Ludmilla.\n\n\u201cWell, appreciate you coming to me with this. When the invasion comes, it will be important for us to coordinate.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cSo I take it you\u2019re not worried about this and siding with Ludmilla?\u201d\n\u201cWorried? Hmm\u2026perhaps a little cautious, but the situation isn\u2019t nearly as grim as your sources told you which you said was from a pirate captain he hired?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the source, yes. Wait, you seem like you know something about this.\u201d\n\u201cI do and so does Ludmilla. I mean she might be a bit flakey at times, but the woman is not dim. She\u2019s been making her own preparations and so have we. Honestly I\u2019m sort of surprised given your new connections to the Ebony Claw, you would have learned of this plan long ago.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t exactly forth coming with information. Our relationship isn\u2019t the most open. I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re planning on sabotaging Peter this time like I\u2019ve been told they have in the past.\u201d\n\u201cMm, that\u2019s always a possibility. Though our own information says Peter\u2019s come to some sort of understanding with them this time and they won\u2019t interfere, however that doesn\u2019t matter. Peter\u2019s invasion isn\u2019t going to succeed.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem very sure and very well informed on this. Have you increased your telepathic powers or something?\u201d\n\u201cHah! I wish. No, but I have been in contact with the Delantium Kingdom\u2019s magic University and made a couple friends there while trying to get this school up and running. I\u2019ve been told the TWO wizards he\u2019s hired were drop outs from the university and while I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you go up against them, I\u2019m secure that my people will be able to handle them. So no, he doesn\u2019t even have a squad of wizards at his command. If anything his orc mercs are going to be a bigger problem assuming they even make it to the fight that is. A lot can happen between Delantium and Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026well that does sound less hopeless than I heard.\u201d\n\u201cMake no mistake, this city IS going to suffer some shit, but I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s going to be any worse than the last time the Varsakken\u2019s had it out with each other. Reports say he\u2019ll probably be ready next year. So let me ask you, were you considering joining Peter\u2019s invasion then?\u201d\n\nYou chuckle at the thought of saying \u201cyes\u201d at this point.\n\n\u201cWell let\u2019s just say I was keeping my options open based on which way you were going.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet, upholding our alliance. And who says there isn\u2019t honor in the underworld.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cYeah, well I can\u2019t backstab everyone, it might hurt my reputation.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. You\u2019re already responsible for the demise of the Thieves\u2019 Guild, an ECS chapter, the Joachimites and the Felians.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I was never affiliated with the Joachimites.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. You had better sense than that. Well if that\u2019s all, I should be getting back. Have to train these folks in battle magic after all, I assume if you come across and new information, you\u2019ll share it.\u201d\n\nYou bid Heather goodbye and make your way back home where you get back to business. Though you\u2019re a little concerned about Vera getting back okay.\n\nA month passes and she does indeed make it back of which you\u2019re most relieved.\n\nShe tells you that you were right all along and that siding with Peter isn\u2019t the best way to go on this based on the meeting she had. Vera tells you that his terms weren\u2019t even very good, just basic amnesty for anything done before he takes back the city and perhaps a bit of leniency on softer criminal activity, but not continued free reign like you have now.\n\nHowever she said that she was given permission to accept Peter\u2019s deal for you, so as far as he knows, you\u2019re on his side.\n\n\u201cGood, nice thinking Vera.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I figured it shouldn\u2019t be a wasted trip. So what have you been up to?\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking with our magical allies. Seems they got more information on Peter than we do. The guy only has two wizards at his command for example and the Baroness is well aware of Peter\u2019s plans.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Well guess all that\u2019s left now is for us is the year to prepare, what do you need me to do?\u201d\n\u201cI need you back in Jicol where you can keep an eye on things there. Also, I want to make sure if shit goes really bad here, this organization will still exist in some form at least and there will be somewhere to retreat to. If possible try to convince some of those pirates you deal with not to join Zamed\u2019s flotilla. I hope you weren\u2019t too attached to him.\u201d\n\u201cMeh, I was done with him anyway. I suppose I\u2019ll be taking another ship back to Jicol though.\u201d\n\nAfter spending a few more days in Holgard, Vera finally takes her leave and she\u2019s gone again. You\u2019ll definitely miss her being around, you hope the next time you see her it\u2019ll be under better circumstances.\n\nIn fact you just hope you\u2019ll actually survive to see her again, or hell just survive period. While Heather did reassure you of some of your concerns, there is still an invasion to \u201clook forward to.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve survived a lot in this city and sometimes you wonder if it really is Yag rolling well for you, but you\u2019re hoping that you really are just that good at all this.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 33\n\n\u201cShit, these fucking orcs don\u2019t die like they should.\u201d You say after putting two more shots in a large greenskin trying to get back up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think it matters boss, this brothel\u2019s fucked, and not in a good way. Just bout every whore in here is dead.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d\n\u201cWell there were a couple survivors, but I think their whorin\u2019 days are over.\u201d\n\u201cDamnit, that\u2019s another one destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cAn wez lost a few purple wish houses and sum gambling dens too. Hopefully we can save da rest before we don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d\n\nYou look around at the destruction of the brothel you\u2019re currently in and try to temporarily ignore the loud chaos going on outside as you gather your thoughts on what to do next.\n\n\u201cDamnit.\u201d You say seeing a familiar woman on the floor with an axe wound in her head.\n\u201cWat?\u201d Warts asks.\n\u201cI know this whore or rather I did. Name was Naji. She was that girl that I rescued back when you talked me into ripping off Reginald\u2019s house.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, dat wuz a long time ago boss. Yer memory iz good if you can member whores. I can\u2019t even member when my weddin\u2019 anniversary is, though I wuz drunk at the time an\u2019 Snuffit reminds me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell she was a bit special for awhile, but as you might know my heart always really belonged to Tanya. I knew Naji was still whoring, and after we got the Nocturnal League set up I made sure she always had a job in one of our brothels, but I never did speak with her again in person. Always thought about it sometimes, but just figured I could get around to it when I wasn\u2019t busy. Guess it\u2019s too late now. Seems rather pointless that I even rescued her given that she just wound up dead anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell look on da bright side boss, it looks like she got a cleaner death with a quick axe strike as opposed to wat dose cultist fuckers woulda did.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose. She also was Rook\u2019s cousin, which probably saved me from him killing me. In any case, I\u2019m having serious concerns about this attack.\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah boss, da whole cities goin\u2019 ta shit again.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean why the fuck are we even being attacked? I mean yeah I get orcs tend to be enthusiastic about their marauding, but something about the fact that OUR businesses are getting attacked like they were military targets seems really fucking suspicious.\u201d\n\u201cMebbe dat Peter knew we weren\u2019t really gonna help him.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s definitely possible, but it still doesn\u2019t explain why we would be targeted so much and so accurately. I would think he\u2019d want to focus his forces on taking the palace or taking out the mage school. Also his invasion force was a lot larger than first reports mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cI guess Vera wasn\u2019t too successful in convincin\u2019 other pirates to not join her ex-boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned about her too, since the last message we got was six months ago from her and she said she was having some success in her endeavors.\u201d\n\u201cWell she must be okay, because we wuz still gettin\u2019 da cut from her even last month.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but at the rate shit is going down here, we might not even be able to pay the pittance that the ECS asks for every month.\u201d\n\u201cYou sayin\u2019 you don\u2019t have a secret personal stash?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to part with my shit to pay the damn ECS. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d feel the same way about your stash.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I ain\u2019t got no personal stash. Snuffit takes it all. Speakin\u2019 of her, I think I\u2019ll be getting back to her. Seems like this city is a lost cause an\u2019 if you\u2019re smart you should just get the hell out too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck Warts. You\u2019re just gonna abandon everything?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah. I don\u2019t exactly have some bond with dis place. I mean it wuz fun while it lasted, but looks like its come to an end. I mean maybe dis place will be better again in a couple years or so. An\u2019 didn\u2019t you make plans to retreat to Jicol is shit started to go wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but again, I\u2019m still not sure if everything there is okay.\u201d\n\u201cBah, Vera\u2019s fine, she\u2019s probably just really fuckin\u2019 busy. I mean you know how it is. Look dis iz the ways I sees da situation\u2026\u201d\n\nWarts steps over a couple bodies before addressing you again. He gives you a more serious look than he normally does.\n\n\u201cYouz gotta be the luckiest Yag blessed bastard I know, beside myself. You shoulda died so many times, Yag musta been rollin\u2019 loaded dice. However, an\u2019 don\u2019t say dis offen but dere iz a time ta step away from da table and dis iz one o\u2019 dem times. I myself have stayed alive as long as I have cuz I knew when ta walk away.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cAnd you think this is one of those times, you don\u2019t think there\u2019s still a chance to turn this around?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell yeah, there\u2019s always a chance, such are the whimsical ways of Yag, but the odds just ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 good enough for me to take da risk, so I\u2019m off whether you\u2019re sticking around or not, but I\u2019d rather you leave with me, because\u2026\u201d\n\nWarts coughs a bit and looks away. You hear a sniffle.\n\n\u201cWarts\u2026are you crying?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNO! I\u2019m not cryin\u2019 like sum sissy elf! It\u2019s all dis dust bein kicked up due to da battle! Anyway, we\u2019ve known each other a long ass time, made a lotta coin, did a lotta stupid stuff, an\u2019 in sum cases even saved me from getting\u2019 killed. Sometime youz waz an asshole, but you still were better than most an\u2019 especially anyone in da Spiderfang Tribe. Yer, the closest thing I\u2019ve had to a friend, an I\u2019d rather our parting of ways go with me knowing dat yer on yer way ta Jicol rather than dying here over nuthin\u2019.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t be coming to Jicol?\u201d\n\u201cNah, too far. I\u2019ll probably just find work in Spider Fang territory, open a tradin\u2019 post maybe. Most of da folks dat hated me are dead now anyway so it ain\u2019t like I gotta worry bout bein\u2019 a halfbreed anymore. I should be closer to my family anyway. In fact dat\u2019s another reason youz should go to Jicol. Start a family with Vera, I know you likes her. Forget dat demon girl that\u2019s still plaguin\u2019 yer mind, she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nWarts doesn\u2019t really know the whole story to that of course, and you don\u2019t really have time to go into it right now, but despite all that, Warts does raise some good points.\n\nYou\u2019re not out of the fight yet though and you\u2019ve been through two city upheavals already, you can easily survive a third as long as you\u2019re smart about all this. You ran away from home once before, you\u2019re not doing it again, especially not now when you\u2019ve built a life here. Might not be ideal to most, but it\u2019s yours.\n\n\u201cWarts, you do what you gotta do, but I\u2019m gonna do what I gotta do. Just remember whether the Nocturnal League survives or not, I\u2019m still going to be here if you want to work with me again the future.\u201d\n\nWarts shakes his head while giving a slight broken tooth grin.\n\n\u201cSuppose I shouldn\u2019t expected any less from ya. Youz haz a death wish. Always haz fightin\u2019 dangerous groups of cutthroats, goin\u2019 head ta head with religious fanatics, fucking demon bitches\u2026 youz gonna get yerself killed one day and it ain\u2019t gonna be a pretty death when it happens. But guess I gotta respect all dat. I hope Yag\u2019s still usin\u2019 loaded dice, cuz yer gonna need \u2018em.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again Warts.\u201d You respond.\n\nWarts nods at your confidence which you return before he takes his leave.\n\nNow alone, you briefly check the rest of the brothel for any remaining survivors. You don\u2019t find any, but you do tell the couple that Warts mentioned to go find a better place to hide if they can.\n\nWhile you could just start jumping back into the action, you\u2019d still rather have some back up and the only place you\u2019re going to be certain to find some is back at the Nocturnal League\u2019s headquarters where you\u2019re probably going to find the rest of your remaining members hiding or attempting to wait this out. Good thing you\u2019re already not in the greatest of moods because you don\u2019t imagine it getting any better when you have to deal with your \u201cemployees.\u201d\n\nWhen you get back, most of them are a bit on edge, but others are just lazing about playing cards or just generally doing nothing.\n\n\u201cOh, uh hey boss. You\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I can see you\u2019re really glad that I am. Why the fuck are you assholes sitting around playing cards, you do realize there is a siege going on and our businesses are getting all fucked up right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou said we should guard this place.\u201d\n\u201cI said SOME of you and as I remember, you weren\u2019t one of them. In fact, most of you should be up there defending our interests. I\u2019m not even asking you to be a fucking hero or defend the city because I know damn well that\u2019s a pointless endeavor.\u201d\n\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t see why we should risk our lives when we can just wait shit out down here.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is. The excuse you\u2019ve been expecting.\n\n\u201cOh this should be good. Go on about why you feel this way\u2026whatever the fuck your name is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really not trying to be disrespectful boss, but it seems like we can just pick up the pieces after all this is over. If anything we\u2019ll be in a stronger position since the populace won\u2019t be in any condition to oppose us and it\u2019ll take awhile before the new ruler imposes any sort of order. And this Peter is another Varsakken right? He\u2019s probably not going to be any better than his sister, so it\u2019ll be business as usual.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought. I see you really thought this out while sitting on your chair playing cards and drinking your ale. Here\u2019s another thought though. While we\u2019re sitting here playing cards, telling jokes and jerking each other off, all of our business interests are getting fucked up. All our Purple Wish dens? Destroyed. That\u2019s a shitload of our income right there and it can\u2019t be easily made up. Our whores? Slaughtered. Again can\u2019t easily be made up, unless you lot are gonna start selling your asses to make up the loss and I guarantee it wouldn\u2019t. Our protection rackets? Well you can\u2019t extort corpses, and that\u2019s what A LOT of them are right now thanks to orcs just killing everything in sight. I mean fuck, we ARE supposed to be protecting these hapless suckers if not out of the goodness of our hearts then at least for our own pockets! Shit, that\u2019s the whole damn point!\u201d\n\nYour voice continues to rise as you walk around the room admonishing your people.\n\n\u201cThis idea that we\u2019ll just pick up everything after everything is over is laughable, because there won\u2019t be that much left and what IS left, Peter Varsakken is going to be establishing order over, and I\u2019m telling you right now, whether he\u2019s as corrupt as the rest of his family or not isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is, we DON\u2019T have a good working relationship with him like we do with his sister. Shit like that takes time and trust, both of which we are in short supply of. And to top it all off the ECS is going to still be breathing down our necks telling us we better pay up by the end of the month. How are we going to fucking do that if all of our income has turned to fucking rubble? Is ANY of this getting through or am I talking to a bunch of fucking retards?\u201d\n\nSuddenly another one stands up.\n\n\u201cWell gee boss, why don\u2019t you get your precious hobs to fucking do all this shit?\u201d\n\u201cBecause most of the hobs are fucking dead that\u2019s why, which is another loss since a lot of them were our best pit fighters. And I highly recommend you take it way down, before I take YOU down.\u201d\n\nNow several others stand up to join the troublemaker. Though a few of them look unsure. Some don\u2019t take a side and just quietly slink back into a place where they might be safe from the fighting.\n\nOne thing you are noticing is nobody seems to be siding with you. This is worse than you thought. You already have your hand on your weapon.\n\n\u201cNo! You\u2019ve been bossing us about for months getting prepared for this fucking invasion and none of us see why we should even be involved. You do this ALL the damn time, dragging us into these unnecessary conflicts instead of just staying the fuck out of it. You did this with the religious faction war, you did this with the Felians, who were supposed to be our allies and now you\u2019re doing it here. And who is on the losing end of all of this shit? US! That\u2019s who! We\u2019re the ones fucking dying! Well no fucking more! We\u2019re all staying down here and riding this out, and if you don\u2019t like it, tough shit, because if you haven\u2019t noticed by now, you\u2019re fresh outta friends and you don\u2019t even have your filthy hob scum to protect your ass anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously, you ALL feel this way? You fuckers are the most short sighted assholes ever if you\u2019ve decided that right now would be the best time to pull a double cross and MORE fool you that you didn\u2019t kill me right away.\u201d\n\u201cWell we can take care of that right now, and you don\u2019t have enough bullets to kill us all.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to kill you all, I\u2019m just gonna kill you and I don\u2019t need hobs to do my work.\u201d\n\nThe troublemaker\u2019s eyes widen and he goes for his own flintlock, but he\u2019s too slow of course and you\u2019ve already killed him and three others before everyone has taken cover. Nobody else is returning fire or attempting to attack, which means you\u2019ve probably asserted your dominance once again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Now contrary to this dead fucker\u2019s words, I\u2019ve been risking my ass more than ANY of you since day fucking one! Who the hell was it that was leading the damn charge when we took out the Joachimites and Felians? As I remember it was me. And what the hell have I been doing while you lot were hiding like cowards, I\u2019ve been trying to keep this organization together by defending our shit! So don\u2019t give me this bullshit that I\u2019ve been leading from the back. Maybe the real problem is you shitheads have all gotten lazy because you have no regular opposition. Scared of a real fight. Y\u2019know what? Fuck all of you. I\u2019m going back up there to try to salvage what this organization still has left. The rest of you can either help or get the fuck out of the way, but what you can\u2019t do is stay here. Because when I come back, I find ANYONE still here, you\u2019ll be joining these troublemakers on the floor.\u201d\n\nWith those last words you leave.\n\nYou have no idea if you\u2019re even going to have an organization left if you survive all this, but that doesn\u2019t matter right now. Right now you\u2019re going to do something even more foolish and find out what the hell\u2019s going on with Heather and her crew of wannabes because if you can get the wizards to help you in this chaos, staying here will have at least been worth the effort.\n\nTracking them down is fairly easy because it\u2019s the part of the city that EVERYONE is avoiding, lot of explosions, debris flying in the air, fire, strange lights and even stranger noises in general.\n\nWhen you arrive in the general vicinity, you finally get a good look at what\u2019s going on. You see several creatures that remind you of some sort of demonic dwarves since they\u2019re about the same height, and pretty stocky. They\u2019re attacking a group of wizards wearing purple robes which you\u2019re guessing are Heather\u2019s people though you don\u2019t see her.\n\nHeather\u2019s people are holding their own, but the problem is the demons don\u2019t stay dead or rather as soon as one is killed another one materializes. They can\u2019t possibly keep this up forever. A little bit in the distance you also catch sight of a man in a shabby brown robe. You\u2019re guessing this is the one summoning the demons. He must have some strong protection up, because demons aren\u2019t known to enjoy being summoned by mortals.\n\nYou also see two figures battling it out on top of one of the few standing buildings left in the area. You see all manner of magic being thrown about and most of it hitting nearby parts of the city. You can\u2019t quite make out the figures, but you\u2019re guessing one of those might be Heather.\n\nThe way you see it, you can either climb up the building to try to help Heather or try to help her students.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Heather", "result": "Honestly, Heather is still your best chance at getting cured, so if she\u2019s dead then you might as well have left Holgard when this all happened. Besides, you don\u2019t fancy your chances against multiple demons and a wizard. You figure if you\u2019re quiet and careful enough you\u2019ll be able to sneak up to the top of the building and just shoot the wizard opposing Heather in the back.\n\nWell that\u2019s the ideal plan anyway.\n\nYou duck into the building that Heather and her opponent are fighting on top of and avoid the demon-wizard battle completely.\n\nSurprisingly the inside of the building (which you think is Holgard\u2019s hall of records. Some sort of government building anyway, you have no idea, never been here or paid attention to it before) isn\u2019t too torn up by the fighting, though it looks like the people hiding here didn\u2019t fair too well since you\u2019re seeing a lot of dead bodies that look like they have the life drained out of them.\n\nYou on the other hand are feeling a little weird. Not like your life is suddenly being drained out of you, but more like a feeling of energy around you. Almost like your hair is starting to stand on end. Must be all the magic being thrown about.\n\nYou\u2019re just about to head up to the second floor and that\u2019s when you hear a groaning noise. You look back, but you already know what you\u2019re going to see.\n\nSeveral of the corpses you just passed are now getting up and they\u2019re all making their way towards you.\n\n\u201cOf course. Shit.\u201d You say and quicken your pace and the corpses do likewise.\n\nWith a bunch of undead now chasing you, it\u2019s a very good thing that government buildings tend to have the same layouts making it at least easy for you to keep finding the next flight of stairs. This is counter balanced by more corpses of the government officials stirring whenever you reach a new floor.\n\nBy the time you make it to the top floor, you\u2019ve got a horde chasing you. You scramble up the ladder to the roof and fling open the hatch. There upon the roof, you see Heather and her antagonist throwing bolts of magic and blocking each other\u2019s attacks. It would seem they\u2019re evenly matched and neither one is paying any attention to you.\n\nMeanwhile, corpses are making their way up the ladder. You shoot the first one in the head and then slam the hatch down and stomp on it a couple times. It\u2019s not going to hold them for long, and you can\u2019t stand here forever keeping all your weight on it.\n\nThe noise of your pistol now causes the opposing wizard to take notice of you. He doesn\u2019t waste any time in throwing a bolt of energy at you. You try to get out of the way, but you still get hit with a blast strong enough to cause you to go flying backwards.\n\nYou ignore the pain in your chest as you desperately attempt to not fall off the side of the roof. The top half of your body hangs over the edge as you struggle to move from your precarious position. You manage to sit up just in time to see the wizard throwing another magic bolt your way.\n\nThis probably would have been the end of you had the hatch not opened back up and corpses crawling out of it. Instead of hitting you, the bolt hits a couple of the corpses instead and you scramble out of the way so as not to get hit by flying body parts heading your way.\n\nAs the horde continues to pour onto the roof, your visibility of the other wizard and Heather is starting to be blocked by said horde. You desperately shoot at the horde, but unlike your previous experience back at the League headquarters, you\u2019re not going to intimidate them by killing a few. There\u2019s nowhere to go either. The closest building isn\u2019t close enough that you could easily jump to it, even if it was still intact.\n\nAt best, from this height you MIGHT survive a fall with several broken bones and given what else is going on down in the streets, you probably wouldn\u2019t survive too much longer.\n\n\u201cFuck. Looks like Warts was right. Yag\u2019s crapped out.\u201d You say to yourself, drawing your blade for a final stand.\n\nJust as one of the slack jawed dead eyed corpses gets within reach of you, you\u2019re suddenly floating upward! After lingering in the air for a moment, you slowly start floating over the street causing the rest of the corpses to follow and go right over the side of the building. It\u2019s fascinating and scary as hell at the same time since you could easily be dropping to your own death right now.\n\nFrom your position, you see Heather on the far side of the building with one raised hand in your direction. You also see the other wizard lying on the roof smoldering and still burning. You didn\u2019t see it because you were too occupied with fighting corpses, but it would appear your arrival was enough distraction that allowed Heather to get the upper hand over her opponent.\n\nWith all the undead now a pile of splattered bodies on the street (Well most of them anyway) and no longer a threat, Heather pulls you forward and gently places you back on the rooftop where upon you walk over to her.\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThank you for the distraction. Shit, I\u2019m fucking exhausted dealing with asshole.\u201d Heather says and indeed looking very worn. In fact, she even looks a bit older.\n\u201cI was actually coming to do more than just be a distraction, but suddenly I was getting attacked by a hundred dead bean counters.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the repercussions of wild dark magic being thrown around. This building might have some strong magic protection, but it didn\u2019t do shit for the people inside.\u201d\n\u201cIt does?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah. It\u2019s where all the records to the city are held. Last thing the government wants is stuff like that getting destroyed. I put the protection wards up myself when Ludmilla requested it months ago. Why do you think the building is still more or less intact?\u201d\n\u201cHm, thought it was unusual. Anyway, your students are having their own problem with demons that they\u2019re fighting in the streets right now. I think the other wizard keeps summoning them.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he is. Y\u2019know, that\u2019s probably why these idiots got themselves kicked out of the Delantium University in the first place, dabbling with necromancy and demonology. That shit could potentially destroy a world if used as reckless as it has been here. Well guess I better sort this out, before taking a break.\u201d\n\nYou tell Heather where you saw the fighting going on and she goes over to the right side of the building and sees for herself. It\u2019s still a stalemate from what you can tell and fortunately Heather says this will be easy to take care of.\n\nShe conjures up a fireball and directs it towards the other wizard in the street below. He\u2019s not even looking in that direction so he takes the hit. You then see a figure screaming and burning which is then followed by one of the demons leaping on him and ripping him apart.\n\nHeather\u2019s people take advantage of the situation and blast the demons with all they have. Without the other wizard up keeping the spell, they aren\u2019t materializing any longer and stay permanently dead. Though you do see one leap away from the battle and out of sight. Looks like that will just be one more evil thing brought into this world. (Not that it\u2019s going to make much of a difference)\n\nWith the immediate threat over with, you and Heather head back down the ladder where thankfully there aren\u2019t anymore walking dead lurking about. Heather\u2019s students soon meet up with the both of you. They look even more tired than she does and you notice there are significantly less of them than the last time you remember.\n\n\u201cGrand Matriarch! Are you hurt!? I can heal you!\u201d Gwen asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Gwen, see to our friend though, maybe he\u2019s hurt, I saw him take a magic bolt to the chest.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\nGwen goes over to you and starts to check you out, but you don\u2019t feel like you really need any tending to either.\n\n\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m really okay.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLet me just cast a minor healing spell, you look like you could use it. Were you fighting before you got here?\u201d Gwen remarks and starts casting something over you.\n\u201cYeah, mostly orcs, some humans. All assholes.\u201d\n\u201cWow, orcs huh? That takes some courage to go toe to toe with the likes of those big green guys.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I had some green guys of my own. A little on smaller side though. Hm, starting to feel a lot better. At least not aching in pain anymore. Guess I did need that after all. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d\n\nGwen\u2019s attitude is a lot different than you last remember.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh Cooper? He\u2019s not my boyfriend anymore, he ran off a couple months ago. He didn\u2019t want to stick around during the invasion. He was a big coward after all, not like you.\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah. I think I\u2019m okay right now Gwen.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cThe man said he doesn\u2019t need any more attention so stop hovering over him and go back over there with the rest of your class.\u201d\n\nGwen gives you a small smile before leaving you to go back to the rest of her, causing Heather to make an eye roll.\n\n\u201cCalled it.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cHm, well I guess better that she\u2019s friendly now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShe\u2019s still fucking annoying. If she didn\u2019t show such natural talent for magic, I\u2019d probably just throw her ass out of the school.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I would think you\u2019d want everyone you could get. I mean there aren\u2019t many of you after all.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well you don\u2019t have to deal with her on a daily basis. However, you are correct in that pragmatism did also influence the decision to keep her around. I\u2019m about the last very experienced wizard in this city now anyway. The few remaining true Dornans either left when I first got the school started or died during this invasion. Still it\u2019ll be enough to turn back the tide. It\u2019s just really taking its toll on me. Pretty sure you can already tell.\u201d\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to. Magic has a habit of making you old before your time. That\u2019s why whenever you someone talks about wizards; the stereotype is some decrepit old person. It\u2019s not that far off, except the old person usually isn\u2019t all that old in years at least. But such is the price we pay for being skilled in the gift that Dorna bestowed upon this world.\u201d\n\nHeather, yourself and her group take this moment to rest up and talk a bit of strategy.\n\nThe current situation is bad, but not entirely unwinnable. You just have to make one major attack to turn the tide. Heather is in favor of helping what little remains of Ludmilla\u2019s defenses at her palace. Heather says breaking up the attack going on there should destroy the rest of Peter\u2019s forces or at least the majority of them. At that point he won\u2019t have enough people to take the city, let alone hold it given that Ludmilla will still be alive at that point.\n\nWhen you ask if there is any other alternative, Heather says, you all could attack Peter directly since he\u2019s probably still aboard his ship. The problem with that is, there is still a good-sized fleet near the Holgard docks. Heather says casting magic at the ships might bring a few of them down, but not before the rest of them start firing cannonballs back, and who knows if you\u2019re going to get Peter or not.\n\nStill, if you take out Peter then it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re going to have to worry about him ever trying this in another five to ten years and having to deal with it again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Defend the palace", "result": "What Peter may or may not do in the future is something you\u2019ll just have to face then, but right now it\u2019s probably best to make sure Ludmilla is still in power after all this.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go bail out the baroness I guess. Though it\u2019s not exactly like I got magic to throw around like the rest of you, not sure how much help I\u2019ll be.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell since it\u2019s an incredibly bad idea to summon demons or raise corpses for protection, it can\u2019t hurt for you to provide a little extra protection. Where is the rest of your crew anyway?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask, in fact after this is all over I might not even have one anymore. Anyway, let\u2019s get on with this.\u201d\n\nWith as much rest as you\u2019re going to get under these conditions, you and the wizards are soon on your way to the palace.\n\nYou actually don\u2019t have many problems on the way there, but you do come across a few unexpected faces. It\u2019s some of the Nocturnal League. They look like they\u2019ve already been in a few scrapes.\n\n\u201cThere you are boss! We\u2019ve been looking all over for ya!\u201d one of them remarks.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve found me, and I hope for your sake, you\u2019ve come to help.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe have! Um, we\u2019ve managed to save couple of our brothels from getting too fucked up. We\u2019ve also been having people take the whores back to headquarters and stay there until it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear we\u2019re making Holgard safe for whores again at least. Come on, you\u2019ve all got a new task. We\u2019re heading to the palace and making sure to keep these spell slingers safe along the way because they need to save their strength for what lies ahead.\u201d\n\nNot questioning your leadership again, your people follow you.\n\nAs you get closer to the palace, you start coming across more of the fighting again. This must be where the rest of the orc mercs were sent when they weren\u2019t tearing up your shit.\n\nLudmilla\u2019s people have been holding out pretty well all things considering. The orcs haven\u2019t even breached the palace yet thankfully. If you hadn\u2019t come along when you did though, they might have.\n\nSeeing as you\u2019re not actually soldiers you stick to your plan of just protecting Heather and her students while they do the heavy lifting.\n\nDozens of orc and human mercs go down by magical means be it fire, lightning, frost, or even giant weasel. (Somehow one of the Heather\u2019s people summoned giant hostile weasel in the middle of the battle area, certainly was an unexpected sight)\n\nAs for you, you do your best in keeping skirmishers from getting in close. Several of your League underlings don\u2019t survive though and after it\u2019s all said and done, you\u2019re pretty much the last man standing from your group, but the day is won and what little remains of the invasion force flees.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re going to regroup later, but there probably isn\u2019t enough for them to do so at this point. Peter will probably have to abandon his plans of retaking his \u201cbirthright\u201d and try again another day. Hopefully not anytime soon.\n\nYou look over at your wizard allies and all of them are alive or more importantly Heather is still alive. She\u2019s looking even worse now though. She\u2019s roughly around your age, and now she looks about fifteen years older. You ask her if she\u2019s okay and she snaps at you which is slightly out of character for her, but you suppose this all has really taken a toll on her.\n\nWith the immediate threat gone, the battered palace doors are finally opened up and you\u2019re all urged to enter since the baroness wishes to speak with you all\n\nWhen you enter, you surprisingly see Baroness dressed for battle; no fancy royal robes, she\u2019s wearing finely made armor. A sword even hangs by her side. Apparently she was fully prepared to not go quietly if need be.\n\nFirst thing she does is address Heather and her people and going on about how she is thankful for their help. Heather is doing her best to look cordial, but it\u2019s obvious that she barely even wants to be here anymore. Doesn\u2019t help when Ludmilla mentions Heather\u2019s obvious aging through magic use and mentions that she made sure to use her own magic sparingly so as not to over exert herself.\n\nYou can imagine that if this was anyone else but the baroness, Heather would be igniting her on fire for her words since Ludmilla\u2019s coming off like she\u2019s just as knowledgable about magic as Heather is.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about sweeping up the remainder of the invasion force she finally turns her attention to you. Heather and the rest leave since they more work to do and Heather looks anxious to get out of there in the first place.\n\n\u201cSo, we meet again nocturnal one. Glad to see even our criminal element has a sliver of patriotism in them to defend this great city as opposed to just taking advantage of the chaos.\u201d Ludmilla remarks.\n\u201cWell, honestly, it was probably more stubbornness and pragmatism on my part rather than patriotism.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, well whatever works I say. Your service here will not be forgotten whatever your reasons may be. You can be assured that this government\u2019s relationship with your organization will continue to be a positive one after all this is finally over.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got an organization anymore. Most of them are dead, and the rest that are still alive I don\u2019t even want to be bothered to manage anymore.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? Are you going into a new line of work then?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not, I wouldn\u2019t know what else I could use my skills for anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYou ever thought about working for me directly?\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t expect that.\n\n\u201cWork for you? Doing what exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell it occurs to me, the intel that I received on this invasion wasn\u2019t completely accurate. And this inaccuracy could have easily resulted in a loss. I need a better intelligence system, The Felians were good at this, but Heather convinced me that their\u2026departure would make things better. I\u2019ve mostly relied on her divination and contacts within the Delantium Kingdom University. However, I feel this may be putting too much pressure on her since I\u2019m sure you agree, all of this has been an ordeal for her.\u201d Ludmilla remarks.\n\u201cLooks that way.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, so I believe some of the burden should go to someone that obviously has more flexibility and hands on skill in spying and lurking about and I have to believe someone like you has experience in shadowy works and underhanded ways of gathering vital information when necessary.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose my skills would come in handy for such a task.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m glad you see it that way and I would also remind you that while perhaps many of your numbers have been decimated, not all of them have and you already have a great system in place to draw from. I mean your brothels alone should be a beacon of information.\u201d\n\u201cThose always did come in handy for blackmail.\u201d\n\u201cAnd just think, you will now have MORE resources at your disposal and no longer need to worry about the law\u2026not that you did before, but that specter still loomed over you even if it was a friendly one.\u201d\n\nLudmilla takes your hand, though you don\u2019t get an impression of an attempt at seduction or attraction, just more of a way of getting your attention. It\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cBut even a friendly dragon can crush a village whenever it feels like it. I know someone like you probably cherishes the freedom that most living outside the law come to embrace. But I tell you now that living outside the law is nothing compared to using it to rule over others. Bending it to your will as you see fit and never having to answer for it. Why? Because you make the rules and they\u2019re completely legitimate. Don\u2019t be a villager living near a friendly dragon, BE the dragon.\u201d\n\nYou smile a bit. The baroness certainly has a way with words.\n\n\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying baroness, however even if I take you up on your offer, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the friendly dragon in the scenario. That would still be you.\u201d You say, causing her to laugh a bit.\n\u201cWell, this is why you\u2019d make a good spymaster. You\u2019re a realist that doesn\u2019t have delusions of grandeur! You\u2019re right of course, I am the friendly dragon, but you at least wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the friendly dragon\u2019s minions because you\u2019d indirectly be in charge of them, to a limited degree of course. Better to stand with the dragon than be under its talons.\u201d\n\nThis is just so surreal to you right now. Never in your life did you ever think you\u2019d get an offer like this. Then again never in your life did you ever think you would ever do this much fighting either, but you guess on that day when you took your first life and had to run your ass out of Teckleville, it\u2019s been a path of increasing bloodshed ever since. Why should Ludmilla\u2019s offer be any stranger?\n\nSure it\u2019s shady and corrupt, but actually working for a government with a \u201creal job\u201d it\u2019s a scenario ALMOST what your parents always wanted and at this point, why not? Might make a nice change of pace.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026when you put it like that, I suppose how can I say no?\u201d\n\nIn the weeks to come, you settle into your new job without much difficulty. Your main task at first is helping in reinforcing order in the city after the invasion since there is a decrease in Holgard soldiers that can patrol the streets. Establishing spies and informants about the various goings on in the city is fairly easy since the few Nocturnal League folks that remained loyal (and were still alive) are practically begging you for a chance to join.\n\nWhile you still aren\u2019t sure what happened to Vera, you write a letter to her, informing her of the situation. Telling her that she\u2019s in charge of the Nocturnal League now or whatever she wants to call it as you have moved on. You also tell her you\u2019d like to meet with her in person if possible since you believe you still need to hammer out some details.\n\nEventually the ECS representative comes calling for their cut (with back interest), they find that the Nocturnal League is no more in the city and they can\u2019t do shit to you about it because you\u2019re practically the right hand of the baroness.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what the repercussions though might be. You take it for granted that assassination might always be a possibility, but you\u2019re about as prepared for that as you\u2019re going to be. You\u2019re more of the mind that they may just start leaning on Vera directly.\n\nWithin the next two months, you\u2019ve ironically eliminated most of the random crime in the city thanks to your secret police system. It\u2019s probably the most orderly the city has ever been. Ludmilla certainly approves and gives you praise for being so efficient in your new position. You also finally get a response back from Vera though it\u2019s brief.\n\nShe tells you that everything is fine, but she herself has been preoccupied lately with a power struggle from some upstarts trying to start a new organization and the Jicol law enforcement being more vigilant as of late.\n\nShe also says that she will watch out for the ECS and will visit Holgard as soon as she is able and wishes you well in your new position. Nothing else is said. No personal thoughts on the new situation, just facts and explanations.\n\nYou half wonder if it\u2019s even her, but the terrible handwriting is unmistakable. You chalk it up to her being perhaps very surprised by everything combined with being busy. In any case you know she\u2019s alive.\n\nIn between your new job and your concerns about your past comrade. You\u2019ve also been thinking a lot about your family.\n\nYou can imagine that your parents wouldn\u2019t exactly be thrilled about your new position even if you did officially \u201cgo legit. While it would be easy to just forget about them, as you haven\u2019t seen them in nearly two decades now, you can\u2019t just dismiss them completely. After all, despite everything your mother probably still loves you and your father\u2026well he DID bail you out of trouble for years.\n\nYou decide to write a letter to them. You\u2019re going to keep it short and vague and you don\u2019t expect any attempt at contact back, but at least they\u2019ll know that you\u2019re alive and doing well. (Even if they\u2019re skeptical about how you explain things in your letter to them)\n\nYou\u2019d like to send a letter to your sister too, but who knows where she is, so you end the letter to your parents saying you send your love to your sister as well and to let her know if they ever see her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 34\n\nEver since the invasion last year, Heather\u2019s demeanor has changed considerably, though you imagine her premature aging and heavy task load don\u2019t help\u2026\n\n\u201cNo, I still haven\u2019t found a way to undo your curse I\u2019ve been really fucking busy lately in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cOkay! No need to snap at me. I just thought I\u2019d ask since it\u2019s been awhile since we were in the same location.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah well I got other shit to do. Not only do I have the thankless AND hopeless task of training what pathetic remnants of what passes for wizards nowadays, but I also have a lot of tasks from the baroness who wants protection spells all over the walls of this fucking city.\u201d\n\u201cHm, Ludmilla is very big on defense nowadays. Understandable though given what happened.\u201d\n\u201cI thought that\u2019s what she had you for. Sneaking about snatching dissidents and potential threats off the streets.\u201d\n\u201cI can snatch malcontents off the streets all I want or even send assassins out, but it\u2019s never going to be enough for Ludmilla. She really wants to be safe and your magic spells greatly enhance that.\u201d\n\u201cSafe. Pfft. I could fry her brain inside her skull with minimal effort and all her protection would be for naught.\u201d\n\u201cWatch it there, treasonous words. Though any particular reason why you haven\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I went to so much damn effort to keep her in power and ally with her, it seems pretty counter productive to just kill her now.\u201d\n\u201cWell you could take over.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Funny guy. I\u2019d rather fry my own brain than have the even more thankless task of running a city. I have enough on my hands running a school.\u201d\n\u201cLudmilla seems to enjoy rulership of this city.\u201d\n\u201cShe would. Look, I\u2019d love to stand around and just bullshit with you, but as I said, I\u2019m fucking busy today and I\u2019d like to get in a nap first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine. But you really haven\u2019t found ANY way to dispel my curse yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo, unless you want to go through Flynn\u2019s ritual and go get yourself an unsuspecting girl to sacrifice.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I know it might seem really weird, but I\u2019m just not THAT much of a bastard yet.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself. Though if you ever change your mind and you really want to do me a favor, ask Gwen to help. She doesn\u2019t have any knowledge of what will happen and I\u2019m almost certain that she\u2019d jump at the chance to fuck you.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, what did that poor girl do to you now?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s fucking annoying and that\u2019s enough. I curse the fact that she\u2019s so naturally talented, so I\u2019m reluctant to do anything worse than just verbally abuse her.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026you just offered to sacrifice her to cure me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, if Elder Flynn thought it was good enough for me, it\u2019s good enough for her.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Okay then. I\u2019ll leave you be.\u201d\n\nHeather doesn\u2019t even acknowledge your goodbye and just turns away to leave, walking a lot slower than she used to.\n\nShe has truly become a very bitter woman. You\u2019re a little concerned about her talking so freely killing the baroness. Not really because you have some great love of serving the baroness, but more the fact that such talk and your knowledge of it without doing anything about it could potentially get you in trouble if it somehow got overheard by someone else. Not to mention her general more miserable attitude nowadays puts you on less comfortable footing with her. Nothing worse than a cranky wizard.\n\nStill, you guess she\u2019s fine for now.\n\nIn any case you\u2019re looking forward to finally meeting up with Vera in another day or so. She\u2019s finally had time from her busy schedule of being a crime boss to come to Holgard. You\u2019re sort of interested in learning more about what\u2019s going on in Jicol since your new position has gotten a bit slow in Holgard, you\u2019ve started sending out agents to various other places to keep apprised of the events going on there. So far you\u2019ve only sent one to Klyton and a few to Delantium.\n\nYou figured there was no immediate point in sending one to Jicol since in the few letters Vera sent back she\u2019s given you brief reports herself and says that everything has been going better there and she\u2019s suffered no visits from the ECS, which you\u2019re glad to hear since you were sure she would.\n\nSeeing as you have nothing else to do today you decide to go relax for a few hours at the Unwavering Unicorn which is the only known tavern in Holgard that has managed to survive every form of major strife that\u2019s occurred in this city. It wasn\u2019t actually called that though until after this latest attack though. You guess the owner decided a name modification was in order. Makes a change from picking the usual unwelcoming violent names like Bloodbath Inn though.\n\nYou take a seat in the back with your drink and enjoy the musicians currently on the stage. In the old days you probably would have preferred to spend your off time at a brothel, but you\u2019re starting to get to a point where you\u2019re not even missing sex any more. Which is a bit worrying on a certain level. Maybe you need to seek out new help on this situation. Maybe give your agents a new side mission of contacting the magic schools. Delantium and Klyton both have one after all. While your feelings for Tanya have certainly diminished over time, she\u2019s certainly always going to be in your thoughts thanks to this curse.\n\nWhile you\u2019re thinking about that, a man dressed in a dark hooded cloak nearly sneaks up on you and you\u2019re just quick enough to pull your pistol out on him before he reaches your table.\n\nGiven that you didn\u2019t see him until the last minute, you can only imagine that he\u2019s a shadow blade from the temple of Fel and most likely here on the orders of the ECS. You quickly look around.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just me and I\u2019m not here to harm you. I doubt if I would be in any condition to do so anymore even with my magic now. Couldn\u2019t even sneak up on you.\u201d The man says.\n\nThe chipper voice is familiar and now when you get a good look at the figure so is the face, even if it is partially disfigured now on one side. The man places a small box on the table with a hand that has two missing fingers.\n\n\u201cPercy.\u201d You say, though you don\u2019t put your weapon away.\n\u201cGlad you recognized me, even though I\u2019m a little less than I originally was when we first met. But then I have you or more specifically your little wizard allies to thank for that don\u2019t I? Ugh, I\u2019m sitting down, feel free to keep your weapon on me though if it makes you feel better. Fucking wooden leg\u2026\u201d\n\nPercy sits down and you\u2019re wondering what all this is about.\n\n\u201cIn that box you will find the noses of your agents you sent to Delantium. While the ECS recognizes that you are obviously a hard to kill man with powerful enough allies to cause more trouble than it\u2019s worth to keep fucking with you, they will NOT tolerate you spying on their territory. Do it again, and it won\u2019t matter who your friends in high places are. Consider this a respectful warning.\u201d Percy says shoving the box a little closer to you.\n\u201cWell, that was certainly generous of them. Were they generous enough to keep my agents alive?\u201d you say.\n\u201cAfter they were done with them, I\u2019d say they were generous enough to put them out their misery. Sometimes I wish they\u2019d done the same to me, but I guess I was just too important. Lucky me.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you still have your nose.\u201d\n\u201cThe physical deformities you see and even the some you don\u2019t pale in comparison to the mental scars I have along with the ongoing headaches and nightmares thanks to you and your wizard bitch. The Ebony Claw leadership in conjunction with the Temple of Fel spent months probing and prodding my brain to learn what exactly happened to me during my first trip here. I wish every fucking day they had just killed me for incompetence. At least then I would have died in ignorance. But hey, I\u2019m not bitter and it\u2019s all in the past.\u201d\n\nAt this point Percy calls a waitress over and orders a drink.\n\n\u201cSo they knew.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course they knew! Did you really think you got away with it?\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cWell I figured if they ever learned the truth they would waste no time in getting their revenge.\u201d\n\u201cOh the ECS is good at being patient when it wants to be. Revenge was planned, but they wanted to come up with something suitable. Now of course the standby for a less direct approach at revenge was doing something horrible to your family and loved ones\u2026\u201d\n\nYou remain deadpan and show no expression when this is brought up, but a deep anxiety wells up inside you and you fear the worst.\n\n\u201cHowever after asking around at that backwards little town you grew up in, it seemed that you left not on the best of terms anyway. Apparently you were a complete disappointment to your parents. Hell, from what I heard, not a single person spoke well of you, except for some trashy barmaid that claimed to be your girlfriend at one time.\u201d\n\nHuh. You guess your father DID manage to save Annah. You\u2019d show more expression of being happy to hear that, but you know you can\u2019t right now.\n\n\u201cIn any case, killing your parents that you never seemed to give a shit about and some old ex that you fucked as a teenager hardly seemed like revenge at that point and certainly wouldn\u2019t have meant much to you. Now your sister on the other hand was a slightly different story. It would appear that you got along very well with her since most from Teckleville said as much. Partners in crime during your youth from what I heard.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know if you can keep up this stonewall face much longer\u2026\n\n\u201cHowever, she was fortunate enough to have at one time save the life of someone currently in the top ECS leadership. He apparently has always been a little smitten with her too. So thanks to all that she was safe.\u201d\n\nYou now relax a little. Your worst fears are now over though Percy still hasn\u2019t finished his story of revenge so you know SOMETHING bad must still be coming.\n\n\u201cOther loved ones, friends or family of note were looked into, but the only other major one we ever learned about was a demonkin girl by the name of Tanya.\u201d Percy says as he takes his drink from the returning waitress.\n\u201cGood luck with that one.\u201d You say barely able to contain a smile.\n\u201cHm, Indeed. You keep interesting allies. Also explains how you\u2019ve survived so long. In any case, about this time a plain old assassination attempt was planned, but then that ongoing failure Peter Varsakken was slowly starting to gather enough forces to invade Holgard. In the past ECS had problems with him doing this, but at that time? Not so much, and it was looking like maybe an agreement could be reached. Peter was just happy we wouldn\u2019t be sabotaging him this time.\u201d\n\nYou start nodding.\n\n\u201cI knew those orcs were specifically targeting Nocturnal League businesses.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell tearing down everything you had built before you died was only part of it. The next part was supposed to be the stinger, but it wasn\u2019t anticipated that you\u2019d actually STAY in this forsaken city and fight to the bitter end rather than run off to Jicol. And it certainly wasn\u2019t anticipated that you\u2019d move up in status. After it was all said and done the ECS leadership decided everything evened out and they washed their hands of it. You were out of their hair as far as business competition anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but the Nocturnal League still exists and if I had retreated to Jicol I would have just been running it there, unless you had assassins waiting for me on the way.\u201d\n\nAt this point Percy takes a big drink from his mug and gives you a big smug smile.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know it\u2019s probably too late at this point for it to matter and the Syndicate would probably prefer this to remain a secret just in case they want to use this person in the future, but given all the shit I had to go through because of you AND the Syndicate, I\u2019m giving a big fuck you to both and telling you because at this point what is the worst either of you could do to me?\u201d\n\nAnd here it comes\u2026\n\n\u201cThere was one other person that we found that you seemed to have a bit of affection for, though killing her wouldn\u2019t have really changed much. Sure you would have been pissed, maybe a little upset, but it wouldn\u2019t have devastated you. If anything you would have just tried to retaliate, wasting more of our time.\u201d\n\u201cVera.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, your once second in command and dare I say\u2026friend? Maybe even a little more? In any case, we had an interesting discussion with her and it didn\u2019t even take much for her to agree to betray you when the time came. Guess once Ebony Claw, always Ebony Claw. She works with us now, indirectly of course, but we\u2019re making more profit from her than we ever were with you that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? Think about it. Wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fleet just a little bigger than you planned despite all of Vera\u2019s promises that she was going to convince Hessla pirates otherwise?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t she also try to convince you that siding with Peter would be a good idea and that you should go talk with him? That was actually the first bait, which you obviously didn\u2019t take. The original plan was to try to kill you while aboard the ship. Second plan was when you retreated to Jicol, she would have killed you there, but as usual you\u2019ve got the luck of Yag constantly with you. I sometimes think maybe that\u2019s who I should have picked as a deity instead. I might not be all fucked up now.\u201d\n\nConsidering you thought your family might be dead or in danger, this information isn\u2019t nearly as bad, but it\u2019s still pretty hard hitting and half of the problem is you don\u2019t know if Percy isn\u2019t just telling you this to fuck with you. The other half is you can\u2019t dismiss it either. In fact, his story is more plausible than you\u2019d care to admit.\n\nVera\u2019s letters to you since the invasion have always been a bit vague and come off less \u201cclose\u201d than they did in the past and Peter\u2019s large fleet is something you always wondered about since you know Vera could be convincing when she wanted to be. It just might have been in the wrong way. Plus even the fact that she hasn\u2019t told you that she\u2019s been dealing with the ECS is suspect.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering all this, Percy finishes up his drink.\n\n\u201cWell I can see you got a lot to think about. Whatever it is you decide to do isn\u2019t going to matter to the ECS. So kill her if you wish, there\u2019s probably someone even more pliable in the Nocturnal League that\u2019s more than willing to continue working with us. If I were you though? I\u2019d do something worse than kill her because as you can see with me, there are worse things than dying.\u201d\n\nWith those words Percy gets up, wincing in a bit of pain as he does.\n\n\u201cRemember, no more of your people in Delantium.\u201d\n\nAs Percy hobbles away, you briefly consider opening the small box he left, but don\u2019t bother, instead throwing it away. You also briefly consider shooting Percy, but given the pathetic state he\u2019s already in and potential problems it could bring, you decide against it. He\u2019s just the messenger anyway.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until you get home that you allow yourself an emotional release. Within your explosive rage of breaking a few things and yelling, you eventually calm down.", "action_results": [{"action": "Confrontation", "result": "Maybe it\u2019s paranoia and maybe you\u2019re feeling the emotional effects of possibly being betrayed, but as far as you\u2019re concerned, even if you find out that you\u2019re wrong and she gets pissed about you even accusing her and never speaks to you ever again, you\u2019re still going to feel better about all this. You\u2019re going to find out one way or another after she gets off that ship.\n\nYou\u2019re a bundle of energy until the day Vera arrives. When she does its all smiles and hugs like you\u2019re both so happy to see each other. Maybe she\u2019s even being sincere, you don\u2019t know yet.\n\n\u201cGlad to finally see you here. How are things in Jicol?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh you know, it\u2019s the same old thing. Some good days, some bad, but can\u2019t complain. The Nocturnal League isn\u2019t the same without you though.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet. So is there any place you wanted to go first?\u201d\n\u201cYou a tour guide for Holgard now too? Well, I suppose after all the shit that happened during the invasion resulted in a lot of damage and rebuilding, so I\u2019m almost betting my favorite tavern isn\u2019t even standing anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThe Blackheart? Nah. Totally destroyed. I think there\u2019s a new weapon shop there now.\u201d\n\u201cOh well. I suppose the old Nocturnal headquarters is gone now too?\u201d\n\u201cNot gone, but it\u2019s currently under construction. Trying to turn it into a proper place to train any future agents. Bunch of dwarves there right now, and they aren\u2019t fond of anyone getting in the way of their work. Warts suggested getting goblins since it would be much cheaper, but I figured the extra money would be worth sturdier construction.\u201d\n\u201cWow, really taking your new job seriously huh? Well in any case I don\u2019t have any preference on where to go, so whatever you decide, we can do that.\u201d\n\u201cWell I was thinking of taking you back to my place.\u201d\n\nVera looks at you with a smile.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s very forward of you. You didn\u2019t even offer me dinner first.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask if you if you were currently with anyone either.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWould it really matter to you if I was?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess let\u2019s go then.\u201d\n\nVera takes your arm and the pair of you walk to your home.\n\nAlong the way you and her talk about some of changes in the city. The discussion is fairly light and superficial, though Vera\u2019s demeanor is pretty affectionate. You went into this with a flirty approach since you wanted to see if there was a complete personality change with her.\n\nSo far though, she\u2019s acting about how you\u2019ve always known her to. You\u2019re getting the impression that she might not be faking all of it or if she is, she\u2019s doing a very good job.\n\nWhether she is or not though doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still learning the facts today.\n\nWhen you get to your home, you show her around a bit makes a lot of comments about how nice the place is and that it\u2019s better than her own current dwelling.\n\n\u201cAh the bar, I\u2019ll just help myself if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Vera says pouring herself a drink.\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cIs that a real Daquala head on the wall?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Warts gave me that as a house warming gift. Didn\u2019t like the ugly thing at first, but eh, it\u2019s sort of grown on me now.\u201d\n\u201cSo how is the halfbreed anyway?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Runs some trading post with his family in Spiderfang territory. He exchanges information for coin with me from time to time.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, Warts a family man with a regular job, you working for the government. So much has changed here and it all seems so odd.\u201d\n\u201cIn some ways I suppose it is, but then Holgard was never a beacon of justice. I mean I\u2019m still involved in a lot of shady dealings. I just got legal permission to do it now.\u201d\n\u201cHah, I suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cSo how about you?\u201d\n\u201cHow about me what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going on and on about myself and you haven\u2019t told me about what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, like I said, nothing much. Just dealing with smugglers and pirates, staying a step ahead of the law when I have to, trying to keep the organization together and keep turning a profit. You know the routine, you had to do it.\u201d\n\u201cMm, and you said you haven\u2019t had any trouble from the Ebony Claw Syndicate?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Not a peep from them. Guess they just don\u2019t care about the League since it\u2019s so small and not really a threat to them.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose not, but still I thought for sure they would pay you a visit after they found out, the League\u2019s only remaining holdings were in Jicol and under new management.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe they\u2019re preoccupied with other things\u2026hey so since you work directly for Ludmilla now, have you been invited to any more of her fancy parties?\u201d\n\nOkay. She was pretty quick to change the subject\u2026\n\nYou entertain some more of Vera\u2019s questions and the pair of you also proceed to talk about the \u201cold days. The pair of you laughs about various events that occurred while you two worked together.\n\nYou\u2019re having such a good time reminiscing that you almost forget that you\u2019re probably talking to someone who betrayed you. However, it\u2019s always still in the back of your mind and you haven\u2019t forgotten. You suppose as much as you want to find out, you\u2019re trying to enjoy \u201cwhat once was\u201d while you still can.\n\nMeanwhile Vera\u2019s gotten a little tipsier and a whole lot flirtier.\n\n\u201cSo. We finally gonna fuck or what?\u201d Vera asks, moving in a little closer on you.\n\u201cNow who\u2019s being forward?\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell I mean you invited me over, you\u2019re showing off your big house and you\u2019re plying me with alcohol. You don\u2019t need to wait until I pass out, I\u2019m more than willing right now.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I can tell. Though you actually started drinking without me giving it to you.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I did. I guess I always have taken the initiative in our relationship.\u201d\n\u201cYou always did have a thing for me didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d tell you not to flatter yourself, but I think you know I have always found you quite attractive. Don\u2019t even know why exactly, considering the first time we met you threatened me with rape.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, I told you a long time ago that I wasn\u2019t actually going to do that.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m fucked up enough to find that enticing in some weird way, but only if it was you of course.\u201d\n\u201cWow, that is fucked up. Maybe I should wait until you\u2019re passed out then.\u201d\n\nVera laughs a bit.\n\n\u201cNo, I want to be fully awake for when you ravish me.\u201d\n\u201cSure I\u2019m not going to be pissing off any pirate boyfriends of yours?\u201d\n\u201cNone that matter. And if you meant Zamed, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not going to object since I heard he died pissing off the Governor of Hessla months ago. Not like I\u2019d seen him since we went with your idea to side with Ludmilla anyway. Seems like it was the right choice given the circumstances.\u201d\n\nVera moves in to kiss you, and you slightly move away.\n\n\u201cFunny you should bring that up since I heard an interesting story about all that recently.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Vera asks with a mild annoyance that you didn\u2019t kiss her back.\n\u201cYeah, a Syndicate member paid me a visit recently. Said you\u2019ve been dealing with them. Said you\u2019ve been dealing with them for awhile now.\u201d\n\nVera sits back and you look at her face. It\u2019s like all the color has drained from it and it\u2019s at that moment you know, no matter what she tells you, she\u2019s betrayed you. You\u2019re just wondering if she\u2019s going to admit to it.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026shit\u2026I didn\u2019t want to tell you. I thought you\u2019d be mad. But\u2026\u201d Vera exhales deeply and then continues. \u201cI have had dealings with the ECS, but I sort of had to. I mean they still wanted a cut of the profits, what could I do? I know you would understand that part, but I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not too pleased to find out I was slave trading again.\u201d\n\nYour eyes briefly widen and go back to normal when she admits to that. You didn\u2019t actually know about the slave trading, though you suppose you aren\u2019t too surprised. It\u2019s what she did before she joined with you and you imagine that it\u2019s pretty lucrative what with all the pirate types she has to do business with. She probably was doing it the whole time she was sent to Jicol.\n\nHonestly you don\u2019t really give a shit though. What is more telling is she\u2019s admitting to it now meaning that she\u2019s trying to admit a \u201clesser\u201d offense to distract from a greater one she\u2019s hiding. It\u2019s one of the oldest criminal tricks in the book.\n\nYou look at Vera and it\u2019s very apparent she\u2019s hoping that you\u2019ll believe this partial truth and let it go. You won\u2019t though, and she probably knows that too.\n\n\u201cVera. Before we continue, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to disarm. I know that\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you can get another word in, Vera suddenly throws the rest of her drink in your face and springs from your couch and tries to run for the front door. She doesn\u2019t get far though thanks to her balance not being the best due to her alcohol intake. She trips and slams hard on the floor and then promptly throws up as well.\n\nMeanwhile all you\u2019ve done is stand up and drawn your pistol.\n\nYou walk over to her, as she crawls away from the liquid mess she\u2019s left on the floor. She turns over and sits on the floor with her knees to her chest and her back against the wall. She looks at you and then starts to cry. You can hardly believe this is the same woman you once trusted with your life.\n\n\u201c(Sob) You\u2026you know (sob) don\u2019t you?\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cWell I know what the smug asshole ECS rep told me and you\u2019ve pretty much confirmed it with your actions. In fact I sort of figured you\u2019d outright deny everything or put up more of a fight. Didn\u2019t think it would be this easy. Guessing you must feel guilty about all this on some level. Again before we continue, I\u2019m going to have to ask you disarm.\u201d\n\nVera nods and slowly throws away her blades and her own flintlock far enough away that she wouldn\u2019t reach them in time. You thought you were going to be far angrier about all this, but now you\u2019re almost feeling pity, but maybe that\u2019ll change when you question her.\n\n\u201cOkay, so here\u2019s the ultimate question. Why?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re REALLY going to have to do better than that Vera.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I guess I was pissed at you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou were pissed at me? For what?! I thought we got along really well!\u201d\n\u201cYeah as friends. You always KNEW I wanted to be more than that and instead of being direct, you just sent me away to a fucking island while you were fucking that wizard chick.\u201d\n\u201cVera\u2026what the hell? This isn\u2019t even making any sense! I was direct with you multiple times if you recall. As I remember I never even lead you on in any way. And for the record I was not fucking Heather. In any case I hardly see how that\u2019s an excuse for you trying to have me killed!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try to have you killed! I just wanted us to be close again! You were supposed to retreat back to Jicol, not stay here and be the fucking hero of Holgard!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, some of this still isn\u2019t making any sense. Actually a lot of it, but this is a much different version of what was going to happen to me when I got back to Jicol. I was told you were going to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to kill you! And I would have stood up to the ECS if they tried!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe the ECS about everything? Don\u2019t you think that they might be lying about some of it just to fuck with you? To turn us against each other?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah I considered that, but considering some of their story has already been confirmed as true, I\u2019m finding it a little easier to believe an organization that has made no pretenses of being pissed with me than a woman who is obviously more mentally unstable than I ever could have known. And they already turned us against each other when you agreed to deal with them! Either you\u2019re so delusional that you believed working with the ECS would somehow bring us together, and I\u2019m really struggling to believe you\u2019re that stupid, or you\u2019re just lying about everything. At this point either one wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nVera makes one last outburst.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just let this go? (sob) There was no more danger to you any more and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to conspire against you again. I felt sick the first time I did it. Obviously I STILL feel sick about it. I felt this way ever since I realized how deep I was getting. I was just so\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026. (sniffle) I would always think about that time we got to go to the baroness\u2019 party. I remember mentally believing myself to be a princess and you a prince. How I wished it were you and me that night instead of you and some random whore. I really think things could have been different between us. We could have been more than friends. Even now, I wish we could just forget everything and just live in this house together as husband and wife. I don\u2019t understand, I did everything for you. Why couldn\u2019t you just\u2026love me? (Sob)\u201d\n\nAs Vera breaks down again into tears, you\u2019re almost at a loss for words at this point. Your relationship with women has always been \u201ccomplicated\u201d but this is a new one on you. You never realized just how damn deep Vera\u2019s feelings were for you and honestly it\u2019s still a bit of a mystery to you. Especially given that she betrayed you.\n\nAnd she did betray you. No matter what her twisted logic may dictate, you can\u2019t forget that.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t forgive it. Even if you are genuinely feeling sorry for Vera right now.\n\nThe ECS may not have gotten the most hurtful revenge on you, but they didn\u2019t exactly fail. You can\u2019t even be mad at them. Maybe in some weird way this is finally all your good luck crapping out on you. You have done a lot of treacherous shit yourself after all.\n\nIn any case, you also remember Percy\u2019s advice about doing something worse than killing her.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019ll make you feel any better about this, but you\u2019re fairly certain it isn\u2019t going to make you feel any worse.", "action_results": [{"action": "Mercy", "result": "Whatever Vera has done to you, you\u2019re not going to torture her anymore. What\u2019s done is done and there is no need in drawing this out.\n\nYou put away your pistol and crouch down besides Vera who is still upset and probably expecting you to kill her.\n\n\u201cVera\u2026Vera\u2026shhhhh\u2026calm down\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nVera still doesn\u2019t look in your direction still crying. You run your hand briefly over her hair and then move in closer to hug her.\n\nVera immediately hugs you back, you feel her squeeze you as if her life depended on it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go\u2026don\u2019t let go\u2026just hold me forever\u2026\u201d she says in between the tears.\n\u201cI got you Vera.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(sob) I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nVera mumbles more things about how she wishes you both could do everything all over. She then feels something against the side of her head.\n\nShe moves her head back enough and looks at you with tears in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI love you\u2026\u201d she says.\n\nYou pull the trigger, blowing Vera\u2019s brains out the other side of her head onto the wall and also getting blood on you in the process.\n\nYou sit with Vera\u2019s body for a moment saddened that this was necessary at all. You wipe your own eyes and eventually stand up and compose yourself.\n\nYou get some of your people to dispose of Vera\u2019s body making some comment that she was an enemy to Holgard. (Not that they were going to question you anyway)\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. There\u2019s nothing more to it. You\u2019d like to forget about this dark day as soon as possible, but you know that\u2019s going to take a bit of time.\n\nTo get your mind off it, you focus on your other problem, which is the curse you\u2019re still dealing with. Honestly, if it hadn\u2019t been for that, things might have been different with Vera in the first place.\n\nSince Heather doesn\u2019t seem to be very helpful right now, you go back to wondering if you should seek help from other magic types which again makes you consider sending someone to ask around Klyton or the magic University in Delantium.\n\nYou already got an agent that reports on Klyton so that\u2019s no problem. Delantium however is another story since Percy just said the ECS killed everyone you sent there. While you don\u2019t want to piss off the ECS severely, you also don\u2019t like being told where you can\u2019t go.\n\nYou decide to hold off on sending anyone to Delantium until you get word back from your agent in Klyton. Based on his report, you can make your decision to risk sending some to Delantium or not.\n\nA month passes and eventually you get word from your agent in Klyton. She mentions that the Klyton magic school is barely better than the one in Holgard and the only main difference is they have a nicer looking school and tend to be more \u201cscholarly\u201d as opposed to \u201cbattle ready.\u201d\n\nYour agent says that they were interested in based on the sealed letter you had her deliver to them. However it would require you to take a trip to Klyton. A bit unusual for you considering you haven\u2019t left Holgard in\u2026well since you got here nearly twenty years ago.\n\nYou imagine you could get the time to leave though if you wanted.\n\nThis brings you back to pondering if you should still send an agent to the Delantium magic university. Chances are, if they\u2019re interested they\u2019re going to just ask you to do what the robes in Klyton want you to do. Namely go there yourself and that\u2019s probably even going to be even more dangerous than just sending an agent there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Send an agent to Delantium", "result": "You might as well explore all your options and you really don\u2019t feel like being intimidated. You\u2019ll just pick your most competent agent and tell him to be extremely careful and to not linger there anymore than he has to or he\u2019s going to suffer a horrible fate\n\nAfter sending your agenr off, once again you play the waiting game. During this time you\u2019re pretty paranoid, expecting ECS assassins to strike at any moment. You increase security and generally don\u2019t get much sleep.\n\nOn the plus side, it\u2019s kept your mind off Vera completely.\n\nEventually in a month your agent returns to you none the worse for wear. He explains he had no problems whatsoever. Also says that he delivered your message and explains to you that a wizard going by the name High Mage Teklis says he\u2019s interested in your situation and will meet with you in a week since he was supposed to visit the Holgard magic school anyway for a potential exchange of ideas.\n\nYour agent then gives you a sealed letter saying Teklis provided details for you within it.\n\nYou open it up and it just explains that he\u2019ll be bringing various objects to detect and dispel any curses you might have brought on by infernal creatures. He goes on to assure you that he\u2019s studied infernals and has all the confidence that he can fix it. Of course he also gives you a price too for his time. It\u2019s actually a pretty high number, and you\u2019re sort of surprised that a wizard would be interested in such \u201cmundane\u201d rewards, but in any case, it\u2019s doable and certainly no object for getting rid of a curse.\n\nYou spend the time before he arrives going about your regular business and squeezing a little extra money from the citizens under the guise of a mandatory \u201cdefense tax\u201d so you don\u2019t lose most of your current savings paying the wizard.\n\nYou have your people tell you when Teklis arrives in the city, though to your surprise when he finally does, he comes directly to your home escorted by one of your people.\n\nYou see a very well dressed older man in a suit rather than wizard robes standing before you. He also carries a satchel with him. After he greets you, you return the greeting and dismiss your agent who escorted him.\n\n\u201cYou seem surprised to see me, you were expecting me correct?\u201d Teklis says.\n\u201cYes, however I was also told that you were meeting with the head of the wizard school here and I figured that would be your first priority of your trip.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI can already tell how that\u2019s going to go. A lot of attempts by the one in charge trying to convince me that they are an upstanding place of learning when it\u2019s probably going to consist of a group little more than organized hedge mages or a large coven.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Don\u2019t mince words do you?\u201d\n\u201cJust telling you what I\u2019m expecting.\u201d\n\u201cFar be it from me to get involved in your wizard standards, but the head of the school and her students did protect this city not too long ago.\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t mean to say they won\u2019t have talent at all, but I can imagine in a place like this that they won\u2019t be the most disciplined of magic users. It\u2019s really not their fault and at least they have practical experience rather than that dying school in Klyton where all they seemingly do is read old dusty books and argue about theory all day.\u201d\n\nApparently the Delantium Kingdom wizards think very highly of themselves.\n\n\u201cHowever, apologies if I have insulted your friend. My understanding is that you are friends with\u2026Heather is it?\u201d\n\u201cWell nowadays I\u2019d say that wouldn\u2019t exactly be the term I\u2019d use, but yes we do have a working relationship. In any case, your views on her school are not my concern; you can take that up with her. I\u2019m just glad that you agreed to meet me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, when your agent came to the university asking questions and I caught wind of it, I was intrigued and then when I found out a little bit more of your situation in the letter I was even more interested. So hence why I\u2019m here to meet you first. We can actually get started right away as long we aren\u2019t going to be disturbed.\u201d\n\u201cNo I can\u2019t imagine we will be. Do we need to clear furniture for you to make a circle on the floor or something?\u201d\n\nTeklis laughs as he puts his satchel on a table and pulling out objects.\n\n\u201cOh no. None of that. Well at least not yet since I don\u2019t know how back this curse you say is. Now I know you went over some of it your condition in your letter, but I get the impression you didn\u2019t tell me everything and I\u2019m going to need to know everything if I\u2019m going to properly help you.\u201d\n\nYou begin to explain in the shortest detail possible about your relationship with Tanya and the after effects. While you\u2019re doing that, Teklis occasionally holds up some strange objects at you, some of which glow. He also says a few words and does a lot of hand motions in front of you, occasionally telling you to just continue your story and not to worry about what he\u2019s doing.\n\nEventually you complete your tale and Teklis completes whatever it is he was doing.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I got good news and bad news.\u201d Teklis says.\n\u201cWell, give me the good since I haven\u2019t had much of that lately.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well you aren\u2019t cursed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t cursed. I detect no curses on you. Infernal or otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cQuite sure. I\u2019ve studied infernals long enough to know that you haven\u2019t been cursed by one. Now I do detect traces of infernal presence on you, but given what you told me about your relationship with this Tanya girl, that\u2019s hardly surprising and that\u2019s always going to be there.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe she gave me a disease? Like demon crotch rot or something?\u201d\n\nTeklis laughs again.\n\n\u201cTrust me m\u2019boy if you had demon crotch rot, you would know immediately and we wouldn\u2019t be having this pleasant conversation. No, you don\u2019t have anything. I mean I can\u2019t explain why those women died after you had sex with them. Maybe it was just bad coincidence and you jumped to conclusions because somewhere in your mind you missed Tanya so much and it was easier for you not to pursue someone else. If you got a curse, it\u2019s just the one you made up in your mind.\u201d\n\nWell this is a bizarre outcome. You almost can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cI have to say, never met someone who had a relationship with a succubus and gone on to live a relatively normal life. Usually they\u2019re either killed by said succubus or less common, they commit suicide after an extended period time of separation. Of course I guess it helped you met her before she completely transformed. I imagine your short lived relationship with her was very special.\u201d Teklis says.\n\u201cYeah\u2026it was. It\u2019s been years now and for the most part I do get on with my life, but there really isn\u2019t a day that goes by that an image of her doesn\u2019t briefly pop up in my mind. I don\u2019t necessarily always feel the loss, but she\u2019s there in my head you know?\u201d you say.\n\nTeklis nods and puts away a couple of his magic objects.\n\n\u201cSo is that the bad news? That I\u2019ll always have a vague sense of loss that won\u2019t ever go away?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, the bad news is much worse than that.\u201d Teklis says.\n\u201cShit, what is it? Am I going to start feeling a greater sense of loss as time goes on? Am I going to die of a broken heart in a few years or something?\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re going to die, but not in a few years and certainly not of a broken heart.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Teklis waves his hand and everything seems to slow to a crawl and the room begins to darken. You instinctively go for your pistol, but every move you make is a snails pace compared to Teklis who is now directing his hands towards you.\n\nYou are hit by a solid black beam of dark energy and feel your life force not just draining, but being ripped from you. Every part of you feels like its being eaten alive which might be somewhat true as your body begins to shrivel and you collapse to the floor, too weak to stand up any longer, let alone hold your weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Syndicate should have done this years ago.\u201d Teklis says.\n\nThose words are the last you hear before everything goes black forever.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Just head to Klyton", "result": "After all you\u2019ve been through, maybe some time away from Holgard is exactly what you need right now. Plus you\u2019re not exactly anxious to go pissing off the Ebony Claw Syndicate again after they basically left you off with a warning.\n\nSo you write a letter back to the Klyton magic university and explain that you\u2019ll be heading that way as soon as possible. You also write a letter to your agent there saying that you want her to meet you and make arrangements for when you arrive next week.\n\nYou then pack a few things and give notice to the baroness that you\u2019re leaving for Klyton making something up about rumors that her brother Peter is potentially working with the Klyton government in order to form his next invasion.\n\nBeing the paranoid sort she is, she\u2019s perfectly fine with you going there personally to check things out. Of course as you predicted, you still have to stick around a bit to take care of some of your current business.\n\nAfter a few days of taking care of your mundane tasks you catch the next carriage out of Klyton and you\u2019re soon on your way.\n\nThe trip to Klyton is uneventful, but it gives you plenty of time to think and even appreciate the countryside somewhat. You haven\u2019t left the city in so long, you almost forgot what wilderness looked like.\n\nA lot of the wooded area that used to surround Holgard is gone now thanks to years of Ludmilla expanding the roads and building the fleet to protect the city. Just as well as Warts runs his trading post now as he won\u2019t get many offers as a guide anymore.\n\nBy nightfall, the woods disappear completely and become more open field. It\u2019s at this point you drift in and out of sleep a bit. You see a few random homes and eventually you see the city. Much like Holgard, great walls surround it and the tops of tall structures can be seen looming above, though such structures already look fancier than any in Holgard.\n\nWhen you\u2019re within the gates it\u2019s dawn and you can see that the city is a lot cleaner and organized looking than Holgard. Granted since you\u2019ve risen in status, Holgard has gotten a bit better about this, but this is definitely a city that has never undergone the same struggles Holgard ever has.\n\nAlso unlike Holgard there are a lot more carriages not only going in and out of the city, but also within it. Public transportation was never a high priority in Holgard for various reasons, you\u2019re wondering though if it should start.\n\nYour parents differed on speaking about their old home to you and your sister. Your mother sometimes would talk about fond memories in Klyton, but your father not so much. As far as he was concerned the best thing about the city was meeting your mother.\n\nMakes you wonder though how things might have been different if you\u2019d run to Klyton instead of Holgard. In any case, you\u2019re not here to sight see; you\u2019re here in the hopes that your condition can get cured or dispelled or whatever they have to do.\n\nYou exit the carriage and your agent is soon there to greet you.\n\n\u201cHello sir. Your trip was without trouble I trust?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cIt was.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cGood to hear. I have you booked at the Galloping Mare Inn. It\u2019s one of the better places in this city.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just as long as it isn\u2019t infested with vermin. I\u2019d rather get a bit of rest without potentially getting bitten. (Yawn) So how far is it\u2026apologies what\u2019s your name again?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Claire, and it\u2019s not far sir, we can take a carriage to there quicker. It\u2019s also fairly close to the university so when you\u2019re rested I can take you over there.\u201d\n\nYou nod and soon the pair of you are in another carriage and heading over to your inn. You arrive at the Galloping Mare where Claire leads you to your room and you immediately head over to the bed and get some rest. You figure you won\u2019t sleep too long since you already slept a little on the ride to Klyton.\n\nYou wake up in a few hours and fortunately its still light outside. Probably afternoon by now though. After preparing yourself, you leave your room and find Claire downstairs having a drink with some merchant type. When she sees you approach she excuses herself and immediately goes to see you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake sir, are you ready to go?\u201d Claire asks.\n\u201cYes, who was that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh just one of my contacts for information sir. I can give you a full report of what\u2019s been going on here after you\u2019ve completed your business with the wizards if you like.\u201d\n\u201cSure, might as well. Okay let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long for you to get there and soon you\u2019re at your dad\u2019s old place of higher learning. You never thought you\u2019d ever be here.\n\nClaire then takes you to the magic school area of the campus and that\u2019s where you part ways with her. She tells you she\u2019ll be back at the inn.\n\nYou step inside one of the magic university buildings and expect to be stopped or \u201cgreeted\u201d much like how you were in Holgard by Heather\u2019s underlings. Instead you encounter nobody and walk down several empty corridors almost wondering if the place has been abandoned.\n\nEventually you see some old guy in a robe and figure he must be someone of importance. You call out and he slowly turns to you and making motions with his hands.\n\n\u201cHold on! Hold on! I\u2019m not here to do anything sinister! I\u2019m the director of Holgard security and I\u2019m here about a curse. I have one on me. I sent two letters to this place and my agent gave them both to your people. I was told you agreed to meet me and could help.\u201d\n\u201cHm, must have been High Mage Thomas. He tends to like to speak for the rest of us whether we want him too or not. The man for some reason believes magic should mainly be used for altruistic reasons. The man might as well be a Joachimite Priest if he\u2019s going to believe such nonsense.\u201d The grumpy wizard says, but puts down his hands.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a school? Where is everyone?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a school, but I\u2019m not sure what you were expecting. Magic isn\u2019t exactly a common force in the world that it used to be so you\u2019re not going to find with place overflowing with people. If it were, things would be severely different in this city. Not to mention the government isn\u2019t exactly the most keen on supporting it. If it wasn\u2019t for one of our own on the Klyton Council, I dare say this place would have been shutdown entirely.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather short sighted, wizards can be useful allies in case of an attack.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well glad to see you have some sense at least from a pragmatic standpoint, which is more than can be said for those fools on the Klyton Council. Though there\u2019s currently a man running for a spot on there. He seems to be more in favor of relaxing the magic restrictions in this city. I might actually vote for him. Anyway you said had a curse or some such bother?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess since you\u2019re here, might as well take a look at you. Indeed I\u2019m currently the only one here to do so. Come with me.\u201d\n\nThe old wizard motions you to follow him and mentions that his name is Ahmed. When you ask where are all the other wizards, he says that most of the staff are at some conference and as for any students, the few that they do have are currently out performing their field assignments for classes so they wouldn\u2019t really be lingering around here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a couple of other staff actually around, but probably locked up in their labs either performing experiments or reading. That\u2019s how it usually is for us nowadays though. Seems like we\u2019re all just studying magic rather than actually using it for any real purpose.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said you send the students on field assignments.\u201d\n\u201cAnd depending on the wizard, even that could be fairly easy. Personally I send them to at least bring down a beast of some sort, but many staff member have gotten so complacent they usually just tell them to go hunt down various plants. Honestly it\u2019ll probably be the most excitement they\u2019ll ever get if they stay in Klyton. And if they do stay, they\u2019ll probably become staff and they\u2019ll send their students on some piss easy task, because hey that\u2019s what they had to do so why break the cycle? Feh, it\u2019s really fucking pathetic of what this institution has become.\u201d\n\nAhmed sounds really bitter. Makes you wonder why he\u2019s still here\n\nSoon you enter a small lab and he motions you to sit in a chair and asks you to tell him exactly about your condition and how it\u2019s affecting you and how you acquired it.\n\nYou go into your story about Tanya and most of what that entails. While you\u2019re speaking Ahmed occasionally holds up a glowing magic object to you and mumbles a few incantations. He just ignores you whenever you ask what he\u2019s doing and finally he speaks.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a curse on you.\u201d Ahmed says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI detect no curses. Infernal or otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d take that as an insult if I actually thought you knew what you were questioning. However, yes I am quite sure.\u201d\nWell maybe it\u2019s not a curse, maybe it\u2019s a magic disease like demon crotch rot or something.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, if THAT was your problem, you wouldn\u2019t even be here right now.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but all those girls. They all died.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well shit happens. Look, I can\u2019t explain that since I wasn\u2019t there. All I can tell you is you don\u2019t have any curses on you. As for the girls, well it sounds like you weren\u2019t exactly going with the most morally upstanding ones and violent death is usually a common one amongst the lower class and lesser born. I\u2019d chalk it up to bad coincidence.\u201d\n\nWell this is a bizarre outcome. You almost can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cHowever, there IS something.\u201d Ahmed adds.\n\u201cShit, I knew it.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWell calm down it\u2019s not actually bad, or at least not actively bad.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYour relationship with a succubus is extremely unusual and while she didn\u2019t curse you, she DID leave a mark on you. Now most of the time when this happens, the victim usually dies after the succubus finally tires of them and kills them personally or in a much rarer case, the victim falls into a deep depression and commits suicide after an extended period time of separation because the succubus has abandoned them.\u201d\n\u201cSo is that going to happen to me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve already lived much longer than someone marked by a succubus. Now I imagine in your case it helped immensely that you developed a loving relationship with this Tanya before she fully changed, but I\u2019m sure you still feel the loss correct?\u201d\n\u201cIt is still there from time to time. Yes.\u201d\n\u201cMm. Well I wouldn\u2019t want to assume that you\u2019re going to be fine just because you\u2019ve severely beaten the odds. You\u2019re still marked and who knows what that could do if it ever really kicked in. However, we can purge that from you. If we did you probably wouldn\u2019t feel as bad and a great weight would be lifted.\u201d\n\u201cThat can be done? Wait, do I have to have sex with some girl in a circle while you perform the ritual to summon Tanya?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! No! Where did you get that idea? We don\u2019t need to summon anything, but it\u2019s still going to take a little prep work on my end first. I would like you to come back here in a couple days and see me if possible.\u201d\n\nYou think about it at first wondering if you should go through with it. Then you think that that\u2019s pretty much why you came here in the first place and it would be good to finally rid yourself of all of Tanya\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d even if you were fond of her. Plus now this sounds even less risky than it did before.\n\n\u201cSure. Might as well have a clean slate.\u201d\n\u201cGood, glad to hear it. Okay, you can leave now, I should start preparing.\u201d\n\nYou part ways with Ahmed and feeling slightly more upbeat you rush out of the magic school and head back to the inn where you find Claire speaking with a couple people.\n\n\u201cClaire! Where\u2019s the nearest brothel in this city?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, a couple blocks south of here sir. The Fancy Tickler\u201d Claire responds.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\n\nBefore she can even respond back, you\u2019re gone and already on your way. When you get to the Fancy Tickler, you immediately start throwing coin around so that the ladies can start throwing their pussy your way.\n\nYou spend practically the whole night at the place.\n\nThen the next day you do it all over again. It truly is a wonderful thing to be free!\n\nThird day in Klyton and you figure Ahmed should have his shit together by now and you\u2019re ready to get this taken care of completely.\n\nYou enter the magic school which is still relatively empty and head to Ahmed\u2019s lab. When you arrive, you see Ahmed speaking with a very well dress man with a goatee. They both turn towards you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here. What\u2019s going on and who is this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThis is Mr. Reynolds. I believe I mentioned him the last time we spoke. He\u2019s running for a spot on the Klyton Council.\u201d Ahmed says.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nMr. Reynolds begins to move closer towards you, studying you even.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you look very familiar. Almost like someone I once did business with\u2026tell me someone in your family ever own an inn here?\u201d Mr. Reynolds asks.\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah my grandparents, though my dad also worked there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHah! Yes! That\u2019s where you looked familiar. I loaned your grandfather money which your father ended up paying off. Well, this is a nice coincidence, or perhaps fate?\u201d\n\nSearching your memory, you remember in one of your mother\u2019s stories about the inn she mentioned a Mr. Reynolds before. You never knew much detail though since you never really paid much attention.\n\nMr. Reynolds flashes a smile at you, which really puts you at unease. In fact you\u2019re starting to smell something not unlike brimstone. And that smell can only mean one thing.\n\n\u201cFuck! Infernal!\u201d you shout and before you can even get your pistol out, Ahmed\u2019s already cast a spell that\u2019s frozen you in place.\n\nMr. Reynolds sniffs the air around you a bit and then speaks.\n\n\u201cYes, this one certain does have a tether to the infernal realm and I can certain use such a thing for the upcoming election, though hardly need the entire body, just the heart will do.\u201d\n\nYou look on helplessly as Mr. Reynolds slowly puts his hand into your chest and pulls out your still beating heart. He then thanks Ahmed for this and says he will definitely honor his agreement to push magic as a greater force in this city.\n\nAs for you, your body slumps lifelessly to the floor and will play no more role in world events whatever those may be.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Revenge", "result": "It would be much kinder to just kill Vera now and be done with it and perhaps you would under normal circumstance.\n\nHowever, you have another problem that doesn\u2019t seem to be getting solved another way anytime soon and as grim as the current solution is, this is probably about the only time you\u2019re going to feel someone is deserving of it.\n\nYou put away your pistol and crouch down besides Vera who is still upset and probably expecting you to kill her.\n\n\u201cVera\u2026Vera\u2026shhhhh\u2026calm down\u2026I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201c(sniffle) You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026I mean you REALLY fucked up. Like seriously fucked up. But I guess in your own warped way you thought you were doing something good. Actually I don\u2019t even understand it all, but it really doesn\u2019t matter since maybe some of this is my fault. I should have told you a long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what? Tell me what?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Well while I tried my best to never lead you on, you would be correct in thinking that I did have some affection for you as well. I mean how could I not? We were practically like an old married couple at times.\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s expression begins to change from one of despair to one of hope.\n\n\u201cYou did? I knew it! But, why didn\u2019t you ever return it? Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m fucking cursed that\u2019s why and that\u2019s what I should have just told you. If I had maybe this could have all been avoided.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCursed? How?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd so you finally explain to Vera starting at the beginning when you first met Tanya. You tell her about your odd relationship with the demon girl you fell in love with. Vera never interrupts much except to say that Warts did tell her about Tanya very briefly once, but not in too much detail since he never paid much attention to your love life. Vera seems genuinely fascinated by it all. She\u2019s even sympathetic. You suppose in some ways your obsession with Tanya mirrors her obsession with you a bit. (Though obviously in a vastly different way)\n\nPart of you wonders if things really would have been different if you told Vera this before. Too late now you guess.\n\nWhile you\u2019re telling the stories of Tanya to Vera, you\u2019re also partially reliving some of the good times you experienced with her. You actually haven\u2019t thought about those in awhile seeing as you were trying to keep her \u201cout of your head\u201d as much as you could.\n\nFinally you get to when you finally parted ways with Tanya, along with what you soon discovered whenever you were intimate with another girl. Vera now looks very stunned.\n\n\u201cShit. I never knew. I mean\u2026 fuck. You\u2019ve been trying not to kill me for years.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cYeah. Shame you couldn\u2019t return the favor.\u201d\n\nVera looks away after your comment and goes silent. Her face is one of guilt and shame.\n\n\u201cOkay, maybe that was unnecessary. But I can\u2019t just forget what you did. However, I do think I know how you can make it right, but it might be a little too weird for you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat, weirder than this?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a possible cure and I think you can help.\u201d\n\u201cA cure? Of course I\u2019ll help! What is it that you need? I\u2019ll do it! It\u2019s the least I can do after what I put you through.\u201d\n\u201cWell you do this for me, and you can consider us even. We can even have a fresh start.\u201d\n\nYou take Vera\u2019s hand and look into her eyes.\n\n\u201cTogether.\u201d\n\nVera probably just got really wet right now as she grabs your hand with her other one.\n\n\u201cAs I said. I\u2019ll do it. What do you need?\u201d\n\nYou explain that one of the reasons you were so friendly with Heather wasn\u2019t because you were fucking her, but because she could potentially lift the curse. It just was taking her awhile to research it.\n\nYou then explain that she recently discovered that it can be lifted only by performing a ritual that involves an act of intimacy with one that loves you.\n\n\u201cWait, so are you saying we have to be fucking during this spell?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cWe have to be fucking inside a magic circle to be precise. That\u2019s to keep us safe. Heather\u2019s going to be there the whole time doing her magic thing of lifting my curse. I know it\u2019s weird, but that\u2019s how the spell works I guess.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after that you\u2019ll be cured? You won\u2019t be cursed anymore?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then. If this is the last thing that needs to be done for us to be together then let\u2019s do it. I mean it\u2019s the least I can do after all the shit I did anyway.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not dwell on the past any more okay? Let\u2019s just dwell on the future.\u201d\n\nWith those words you move in and finally kiss Vera on the lips. She embraces the kiss and grabs your head as you do so as if this is all she\u2019s ever wanted. And it probably is. It probably would be more enjoyable for you as well if things were different. (And if she hadn\u2019t just vomited)\n\nYou explain that the pair of you should head to the magic school right away so you can get on with your lives together so that\u2019s exactly what you both do.\n\nWhen you get to the school, you\u2019re not stopped by rebellious teenage wizards this time. Though you are stopped by\u2026\n\n\u201cHey! It\u2019s me Gwen! Remember me? I healed you up during the invasion! Do you need healing again?!\u201d Gwen beams.\n\u201cHi Gwen, ah no healing today, but I really do need to see Heather, is she around?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but she\u2019s very cranky.\u201d\n\u201cWhen isn\u2019t she cranky? Tell her I\u2019m here I\u2019m about that thing she was researching for me and I\u2019m here to go through with it. She\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, hadn\u2019t heard much about this, but then the Grand Matriarch doesn\u2019t tell everyone everything I suppose. I\u2019ll go get her.\u201d\n\nWhile Gwen walks away to get Heather, Vera squeezes your hand a bit. The pair of you wait in silence and soon you see Heather slowly walking towards you both, yelling at Gwen about something who goes running off elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWait, is that Heather? I remember seeing her a couple times and she didn\u2019t look like that! What the fuck happened to her?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cMagic is a bitch to the aging process apparently.\u201d You say.\n\nEventually Heather gets to you both giving you both the stink eye.\n\n\u201cSo. You\u2019re going through with the ritual huh?\u201d Heather asks you.\n\u201cYes. Vera and I have finally realized after all these years that we love each other and thanks to that love, the necessary last element is in place for you to perform this ritual so that you may lift the curse.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI see\u2026is this true?\u201d Heather asks Vera.\n\u201cYes. Our relationship hasn\u2019t always been the most stable, but I know I\u2019ve loved this man for quite sometime and I know with his self sacrificing actions of turning me away and suffering in silence for years, that he loves me as well.\u201d Vera says.\n\nHeather is silent for a moment. You think she\u2019s trying to stifle a laugh, which would probably be the first time she\u2019s done that in awhile. Gwen soon comes back saying she\u2019s prepped the room.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Vera, you go with Gwen who will take you to the summoning room and give you a couple of other instructions. We\u2019ll be there shortly, I just need to speak to you about something unrelated that the Baroness brought up first.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cUm, okay. I\u2019ll see you soon Vera.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of each other after this.\u201d Vera says and gives you another kiss before her and Gwen leave.\n\nHeather is just shaking her head the whole time and then turns to you with a smile.\n\n\u201cI gotta say, I did not see that one coming. That was your second in command at one time right?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cShit. I mean after all your talk about not wanting to sacrifice some unsuspecting girl, you pick her? A woman that obviously loves you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, that is some cold blooded ruthless evil shit that a Neroth cultist would be proud of. I can\u2019t imagine what she did exactly to piss you off. She did piss you off right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, are we going to get on with this?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, yeah. I just want to make sure this is something you REALLY want, because once I start this ritual I can\u2019t have you having second thoughts in the middle of it. It would be bad for ALL involved.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m made my decision and she deserves this and I fucking deserve my freedom.\u201d\n\u201cAlright I\u2019m going to explain a few things before hand. First off I suggest you fuck Vera from behind, because I\u2019m not sure exactly how pissed your ex is going to be when she\u2019s transported from her dimension and you\u2019re going to want to be getting out of their as soon as you can. What you don\u2019t want is Vera to start grabbing you tightly and preventing you to leave as she dies horribly from the inside out desperately holding on to the only thing she loves and then suddenly you\u2019re covered in blood and gore and face to face with your pissed off demon ex instead. In fact I highly recommend you get out of there when Vera starts screaming and convulsing and not in the good way.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, this ritual is going to still take a little time, so I really hope you can last longer than two minutes. It\u2019s not going to work at all if you\u2019re releasing before I can even get the first incantation out.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for your confidence, but I think I can manage.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so. Lastly I don\u2019t give a shit what you your feelings were for your ex, you NEED to remember that she\u2019s a fucking demon. So don\u2019t fucking listen to ANY thing she says. You just let me take care of her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be holding her at bay and hopefully sending her back because if I can\u2019t then we\u2019re all going to be fucked. Anyway, let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nYou and Heather proceed to the summoning room and when the door is opened there you see Gwen standing near a table with a few books and Vera in all her naked glory standing in a large circle with symbols in it. Never seen her like this before and it\u2019s a bit of a surprise.\n\n\u201cUndress please, we\u2019ll be starting soon.\u201d Heather says to you before addressing Gwen. \u201cGwen did you make the other circles?\u201d\n\u201cYes Grand Matriarch, perfect just like you said.\u201d\n\u201cBetter damn well be. Well? Get in your circle if you want to assist!\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not even familiar with what\u2019s going on exactly.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Yeah sometimes spontaneity happens in magic. Look, just grab that top book on the table, turn to page thirteen and recite the words when I give you the signal. You won\u2019t have much to do and it\u2019s a simple enough task even for you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Grand Matriarch.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re getting undressed, you\u2019re mentally preparing yourself for all this. Sex in front of an \u201caudience\u201d, sacrificing a former friend, summoning your demon ex, lifting a curse\u2026it\u2019s a lot to all process. If anything you\u2019re slightly concerned not so much of finishing to quick, but getting started!\n\nWhen you\u2019re naked you step into the circle with Vera who immediately begins to embrace you.\n\n\u201cOkay, you two can start anytime now.\u201d Heather says.\n\n\u201cI guess we better get to it then. Um, I guess I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\nAnd like that, Vera immediately does what she\u2019s offered to do to you several times before in the past. It doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re more than ready for the main act, and given how good she apparently is, you need to stop her anyway.\n\nYou spin Vera around and as you caress her body, and then suddenly pulling her hair you whisper in her ear.\n\n\u201cYou deserve this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMmmm\u2026yes\u2026I do\u2026give it to me hard lover.\u201d\n\nAnd so the hate fucking begins. Though Vera is blissfully unaware of this and just thinks it\u2019s all to heighten the experience. While you\u2019re thrusting in and out of Vera, Heather and Gwen are reciting a bunch of words that you\u2019re trying to drown out so you can focus on the task at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because you\u2019re actually giving Vera what she\u2019s always wanted; it\u2019s just that she\u2019s not going to like the end result. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re stabbing her to death considering you\u2019re practically killing this woman with your cock right now.\n\nAnd as fucked up as that all sounds, it\u2019s actually helping in keeping you in the mood and making you more enthusiastic. (The combo of going this long without sex and under these circumstances you think have really warped you)\n\nTime passes and eventually in-between the moaning and grunting, suddenly Vera begins to cough and she nearly collapses to the floor, but you prevent that by holding her up, though you can tell it\u2019s starting.\n\n\u201cYou need to finish now! Hurry!\u201d Heather suddenly shouts before returning to her chanting.\n\nFollowing instructions, you do just that, though at this point Vera is definitely beginning to not feel well and suddenly coughs up blood.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026ugh something\u2019s wrong! My entire body feels like its on fire! (Sob) Please\u2026I..ARGH!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing you finish right at that moment, because Vera\u2019s own release was not just from her mouth this time.\n\nYour mid to lower half is now covered in a mixture of blood and shit causing you to recoil in horror and disgust. You promptly scramble away from Vera and puke your own guts out, though fortunately in your case it isn\u2019t blood.\n\nGwen, always the helpful one casts some sort of spell on you that cleans you off, causing Heather to snap.\n\n\u201cGWEN! FUCKING CONCENTRATE!\u201d\n\nVera at this point has collapsed completely inside the circle and she begins making horrible screams and wails as her body begins to bleed not just from every orifice, but also from her pores.\n\nYou watch a little dumbfounded. Partially still recovering from being sick and what you\u2019re witnessing. Vera\u2019s cries and pleads for you to help her, but there isn\u2019t much you\u2019d be able to do anyway.\n\nYou force yourself to watch this brutal spectacle and you even shed a few tears thinking that maybe she didn\u2019t deserve this.\n\nVera\u2019s body eventually contorts into an unnatural state and she unleashes a shriek that is definitely not human sounding. She can take no more and with that, her body splits and explodes.\n\nYou manage to avoid getting pelted by gore again by hiding behind an alchemical counter.\n\nWhen you look again, that\u2019s when you see her. Tanya. And she\u2019s much different looking now. Even before when she transformed here in this world there was still a human quality about her.\n\nNow? She\u2019s at least a foot taller than you and her wings along with her horns even bigger and more impressive. She has hooves rather than proper feet. Her body looks more muscular and athletic looking rather than traditionally curvy and sexy. In fact she\u2019s not even naked, she\u2019s wearing some sort of form fitting armor and a wicked looking sword hangs by her side.\n\nShe looks more like a demonic knight of some sort rather than her succubus origins would imply. One of the few things though that remains recognizable to you is her long white hair and her face.\n\nAnd once she gets the general idea of her new surroundings, her eyes finally meet yours.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d She says in a voice slightly deeper than you remember.\n\u201cHello Tanya.\u201d You reply, not quite sure of how to react.", "action_results": [{"action": "Reunion", "result": "While you\u2019re fumbling to at least get your underwear and pants back on, Tanya looks around again, still staying in the circle of course. She examines the gory chunks of flesh that once were Vera and reaches down with a taloned hand.\n\nShe tastes some of the blood and then pops the whole thing into her mouth.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get rid of your curse, you best do it now while she\u2019s trapped. While she\u2019s in that circle you can command her to release you and she has no choice but to do so. So get on with it!\u201d Heather exclaims.\n\nWith your pants now back on, you approach Tanya, who stares at you from the circle. She doesn\u2019t look pleased, but then you aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s just here natural look now.\n\n\u201cTanya, I command you to take off this curse you put on me.\u201d You say trying to be as authoritative as you can, but honestly you\u2019re scared shitless.\n\nAnd Tanya knows it. In fact she just steps closer to the edge of the circle.\n\n\u201cYou command ME? Have you grown so arrogant in your meager mortal life that you believe you can even do that?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just grown stupider.\u201d\n\u201cTanya\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t even my name anymore worm. I have become something much greater and I have long shed any connection to my pathetic mortal years.\u201d\n\u201cEven me?\u201d\n\nTanya doesn\u2019t answer you, but instead just gives a huffing growl.\n\n\u201cThe one on the floor who I tasted. This one loved you, yet you obviously sacrificed her to summon me. Why?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cI told you, I want you to lift the curse that\u2026\u201d you begin to answer.\n\u201cNo! I mean why did you sacrifice her?\u201d\n\u201cShe betrayed me.\u201d\n\u201cI see. And you felt that she deserved this horrible fate?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re about to answer yes, but then on reflection you stop yourself.\n\n\u201cNo. She probably didn\u2019t, but I made a pragmatic decision because I needed something and she was the best way to get it.\u201d\n\nTanya nods at your answer, meanwhile Heather is getting impatient.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake stop talking so much and just COMMAND it to lift the fucking curse! The more you talk, the more it\u2019s going to beguile you into doing something stupid, like stepping into the circle with it!\u201d Heather yells.\n\u201cSilence wizard! I will deal with YOU later. If my former\u2026human wishes to speak with me, then he will do so until our business is done. Now then, before we move on to this curse you speak of, I wish to ask more questions about you, one of which is why have you not moved on from me? I asked you to do so.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cI can\u2019t! You put a curse on me that prevents me from having sex with any other woman! Anytime I do, they wind up dead a few days later!\u201d you answer.\n\u201cSo why blame me? I haven\u2019t been anywhere on this world until you summoned me.\u201d\n\u201cWell who else would it be? Yag fucking around with his magic dice? I mean I have a hard time believing its coincidence; there were too many women that died! I mean maybe you didn\u2019t mean to place it on me, maybe it was some sort of after effect of your power of something.\u201d\n\u201cOh I assure you human, I\u2019m fully aware of my powers, but placing curses? Not my style and never will be. I learned a long time ago, even when I was here in my last remaining years tethered to this world that I enjoy direct bloodshed.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026it had to be you\u2026I mean\u2026wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it was YOU.\u201d\n\nThis accusation causes you to step back a bit.\n\n\u201cMe? That\u2019s absurd.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIs it? Think hard now.\u201d Tanya replies.\n\u201cI think I\u2019d know if I had killed all those women and some of those were accidents!\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe you made them look like they were. It\u2019s Holgard, not like the Watch was going to double check for barmaids and whores.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026if it makes you feel any better, perhaps I AM to blame indirectly. Obviously you didn\u2019t get over me the way I told you too and were still obsessed with my magnificence. I suppose I can\u2019t fault you, after all a mere mortal woman would pale in comparison. But those women? I had no direct hand in causing their deaths. That was ALL you. Even now I can see it in your mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cI can see into your mind. We\u2019re bonded remember? Now granted that bond was severely weakened when I left this realm, but now? You\u2019re like an open book. I can see shit in your mind that you\u2019ve blocked out which is exactly what you did when you were on your whore killing spree.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Because you love me madly obviously and you always will. You killed those women out of fear that you were betraying that love. However, you have a strange morality about you and that caused you to block it out. How you did it so easily, well that\u2019s probably thanks to our bond and you gaining a very tiny bit of my mental powers. Except you didn\u2019t even realize you were using it of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut if all this is true, I must have moved on because I stopped doing it.\u201d\n\u201cWell yes, but that\u2019s mainly because your conscious mind came to the conclusion that I must have put a curse on you so you used THAT as an excuse to not get involved with another woman again. Even this Vera woman, that you obviously had a lot of affection for. I dare say if you had actually given it a chance you might have even broke the cycle. Enough time had passed between us by then and your feelings for Vera were much stronger than they were for the other women. But your love for me just proved too strong. Think about it. Even though she betrayed you, you could have just killed her or even forgave her if you so desired. Instead, you sacrificed her to summon me.\u201d\n\u201cBut I did it because I HAD to see you!\u201d\n\nTanya folds her arms and smiles a bit.\n\n\u201cAnd there it is\u2026and here I am.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026\u201d you say suddenly coming to an epiphany.\n\u201cYou are a fool to listen to this demon and when she eats your soul, I am not going to be able to help you.\u201d Heather interjects.\n\nYou might be a fool, but unfortunately Tanya\u2019s words are proving correct. Your memories are all suddenly flooding back. You see the murders as clear as yesterday now. You see what you did and how you even enjoyed doing it at times. It was you. It was you the entire time and you blacked it all out.\n\nYou slowly slump to the floor trying to process everything and you can\u2019t do it. You just stutter a couple of words and trail off.\n\n\u201cYou cannot command me to lift a curse that I never placed on you mortal. The only curse you have is your love of me and I can\u2019t help you with that. I wish I could, but you didn\u2019t listen to me when I told you not to pursue me in the first place and this is where we are now.\u201d Tanya says with a bit of sympathy in her voice.\n\nWhile you\u2019re coming to grips with your uncovered memories, Heather is done with this whole thing.\n\n\u201cEnough! We\u2019ve apparently solved your problem, now we\u2019re moving on. Demon, I command YOU to transfer the life essence of that woman over there to me.\u201d Heather yells.\n\u201cWHAT?! Grand Matriarch you can\u2019t mean that!\u201d Gwen answers.\n\u201cOh shut up! This shouldn\u2019t even be a surprise to you, never liked you anyway. I\u2019m tired of looking and feeling like an old bat while I\u2019m only in my thirties!\u201d Give me this woman\u2019s youth and then you may return to your own realm.\u201d\n\nGwen attempts to leave her circle but soon learns that she\u2019s trapped within it. Attempts at casting a spell to escape or even attack Heather similarly fail. Lacking any other means of freedom, Gwen panics and begins to plead for her life.\n\n\u201cYou keep interesting female company since we parted mortal. Based on the mewling waif, the old hag over there and the meat chunks on the floor apparently they\u2019ve all been a bunch of treacherous backstabbing bitches, pathetic na\u00efve weaklings or both. No wonder you still long for me. At least even with my infernal heritage I never lied to you.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cDemon! I AM in charge here! I COMMAND YOU in Dorna\u2019s name to perform my task!\u201d\n\nTanya starts to laugh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize your gods and that\u2019s not how it works! That\u2019s not how ANY of this works!\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cSomeone isn\u2019t up on their guide to infernals because you can\u2019t command me to do shit for you. This one probably isn\u2019t in most books about us because it isn\u2019t a common occurrence, but you cannot command an infernal whose heart belongs to someone. And my heart unfortunately belongs to this mortal until he dies or purposely breaks it. And in any case, this circle you made to hold me doesn\u2019t even have the correct symbols on it\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd with those words Tanya slowly steps out of the circle to Heather\u2019s horror.\n\n\u201cOh shit! Gwen you fucking idiot!\u201d Heather shouts and quickly begins to call for help, along with casting a beam of frost at Tanya.\n\nTanya blocks the beam with one hand and then waves her other arm and suddenly most of the furniture in the room is thrown against the door to barricade it. Meanwhile you get out of the way so you don\u2019t get hit by Heather\u2019s magic or get stepped on by Tanya\u2019s cloven hooves.\n\nYou look on in slight awe as you see Tanya draw her sword, which is now on fire and Heather just barely blocking it from cleaving her in two by casting a magic shield.\n\n\u201cPlease! Help me out of this circle!\u201d you suddenly hear.\n\nYou forgot all about Gwen who out of everyone here is innocent in all this.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure how this magic circle shit works, but you can\u2019t think of anything else to do except try to pull Gwen out of it. And to your amazement it actually works.\n\n\u201cCome on, we need to get the hell out of here.\u201d You say and rush to the barricaded door, though some books on the floor suddenly distract Gwen.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?! We gotta get out of here before those two bring this whole place down on our heads!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cIf Heather doesn\u2019t win, then we\u2019re going to need something to stop your ex, I\u2019m looking for some sort of spell. Just focus on unbarricading the door. Hopefully the other students are working on the other side to get in here.\u201d Gwen says as she hastily goes through book pages.\n\nLacking any other plan, you go with Gwen\u2019s and start trying to move the various desks, tables, chairs and cabinets agaist the door. You can hear shouting on the other side to which you yell back for them to blow the damn door open and get their asses in here.\n\nYou\u2019ve moved and thrown aside exactly one large desk and that\u2019s when you hear a scream. You slowly turn your head and see that Tanya has broken through whatever magical defenses Heather had and cut her in half. Heather was no slouch as a wizard, for Tanya to have easily killed her like that...it just defies words of how powerful she\u2019s gotten.\n\nBe that as it may, it would seem that Gwen found something to harm Tanya because she unleashes a blast of magic energy straight into her back causing a monstrous howl.\n\nIt slows her down, but not much as she\u2019s already spun around to face Gwen. She stomps on the ground causing the floor to crack and forcing Gwen to jump out of the way lest she fall into the Holgard sewers, though maybe that would have been a better idea. At least then there would have been multiple escape routes.\n\nAt this point some of the other students have manages to blast part of the door open. Several begin trying to climb over the furniture still in the way.\n\n\u201cBURN.\u201d Tanya utters and you jump back just in time to see all of the furniture barricade go up in flames along with unfortunate wizards that were climbing over it at the time.\n\nThe screams of burning wizards are soon drowned out by another bellow of pain by Tanya when Gwen hits her with another blast of whatever magic she\u2019s using. This time Tanya falls to one knee briefly, but it isn\u2019t enough and now she\u2019s heading straight for Gwen like an angry charging minotaur. Gwen however is surprisingly holding her ground and preparing another magic blast.\n\nYou spy your pistol on the floor and you grab it, but as strange as it may be, you aren\u2019t sure who to use it on.\n\nThe whole time during Tanya\u2019s arrival, you\u2019ve had a stirring within you again. Namely your obsessive love for Tanya. Even this monstrous demonic form, she is still the object of everything you desire in heart and you don\u2019t want to see her hurt no matter how well she\u2019s able to defend herself.\n\nBut you\u2019ll never be free if you hang on to the idea of a relationship that can never be.", "action_results": [{"action": "Aim for Tanya", "result": "It\u2019s time to be free, no matter what the cost.\n\nYou empty your pistol at Tanya. You know you hit her at three times in the head and that\u2019s enough to cause her charge at Gwen to halt temporarily when she collapses on the floor. Gwen doesn\u2019t miss a step and unleashes her magic.\n\nTanya once again makes an unearthly scream as she\u2019s hit by the blast. It\u2019s enough to shake the room a bit and hurt your ears. Gwen looks exhausted, but unfortunately despite her wounds, Tanya is just getting started\n\nTanya suddenly gets back up and even with one eye left and a broken horn from your bullets, she flat out ignores the pain of having a hole burned straight through her armor and body as Gwen attempts to stop her second charge at her.\n\nGwen attempts to put up some sort of magic protection, but Tanya picks her up with ease and smashes her into the wall several times like a rag doll. There is no scream, just the flopping about of a bloody broken body.\n\nYou are attempting to reload your pistol, but you already know it\u2019s not going do any good when Tanya is finally done tormenting Gwen\u2019s body in death and tosses it aside to turn her attention towards you.\n\nYou can\u2019t even run as there is a barrier of fire blocking the exit. The best you can do is get off one more shot before Tanya is upon you and breaks your arm in two and then ripping part of it off. The physical pain is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced before, but perhaps it still pales in comparison to the inner you still have for a love that could never be and is now gone forever.\n\nTanya picks you up by the other good arm and dangles you above the ground like a slab of meat. You look into her one good eye and see a fury that isn\u2019t just one of normal hate or even demonic rage. It\u2019s the stare of one who has been betrayed by their one true love.\n\nThis is the end you know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry Tanya\u2026\u201d is all you can say.\n\nAnd somewhere even now you see a spark of what Tanya once was.\n\u201cNo. Thank you mortal. You\u2019ve freed us both.\u201d Tanya replies.\n\nWith no more feelings left for you, Tanya appropriately pulls your heart from you chest and eats it before your eyes.\n\nYou die just before Tanya drops you back to the floor again.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Aim for Gwen", "result": "That\u2019s it; you\u2019ll always be a slave to loving Tanya. You were doomed when you first laid eyes on her.\n\nYou\u2019ve also learned that you did a bunch of terrible shit because of it and what you did to Vera was terrible too despite what she did to you.\n\nYou\u2019re not a virtuous person and you most likely never will be, but never let it be said that you\u2019re all bad.\n\nYou aim for Gwen, but not a kill shot, instead you shoot just so the bullet whizzes in front of her face causing her to break her concentration and even stumble back a bit. Then you quickly address Tanya.\n\n\u201cTANYA STOP! DO NOT KILL THIS WOMAN! I COMMAND YOU!\u201d you shout.\n\nJust a few paces away from Gwen with her sword in hand, she manages to stop herself from trampling over her. She snorts and turns a scowling face towards you.\n\n\u201cWhy do you stop me mortal?! Do you love this woman?\u201d Tanya asks.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t, but she doesn\u2019t deserve to die either.\u201d You say and walk towards the pair of them.\n\nYou see Gwen attempting to cast another spell and that\u2019s when you really point your pistol at her.\n\n\u201cGwen, you will NOT harm Tanya. If you continue to attack, I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut\u2026but we\u2019ve got her! She can\u2019t do shit right now! I can kill her and then you\u2019ll finally be free, isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Gwen remarks.\n\u201cNo. I love this woman. Why would I want to be free of that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s a demon that is incapable of it?\u201d\n\u201cIf that were true she would be ripping my head off right now. Gwen, I saved your life twice today, you can do me this favor.\u201d\n\nGwen backs off and nods.\n\n\u201cVery well, but I\u2019m not sticking around and I suggest you and your\u2026love leave as soon as possible, because I doubt the Holgard Watch is going to be as understanding when they arrive.\u201d Gwen replies and quickly runs over to the burning barricade and casts a spell to put it out before proceeding out the destroyed door opening.\n\nNow you\u2019re alone with Tanya who doesn\u2019t look pleased with you. You\u2019re about to speak when she suddenly grabs you and suddenly jumps in the air and takes to flight. Using her wings as a shield she envelopes herself (and you) as she breaks through the ceiling of the school.\n\nAfterward, she spreads her wings our again and flies high above the city. You never thought you\u2019d see Holgard from this view again.\n\nTanya is silent the whole time as she holds you close to her body and flies away from Holgard and eventually landing in a spot not far outside it, but away from anyone else.\n\nShe drops you to the ground when you\u2019re close enough and finally she speaks when she lands near you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool. A complete and utter fool. You always were.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cI know.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI wish you had shot at me instead, then you would have ended both of our torment when I ripped you apart for breaking my heart.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cIf you REALLY loved me as much as you claim, you would have! Do you realize how hard it is for me to ignore my feelings for you? Why do you think I look like a soldier of war rather than a seductress now? I tried to eliminate everything and anything that even reminded me of intimacy. I had to fight and struggle not only to block you out of my mind and the weakness that entailed with it, but also endure the taunts and challenges of other infernals who refused to see me as anything other than a succubus with human blood in my veins.\u201d\n\u201cBut you proved them wrong didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes! I proved them all wrong. I thrived on the hate, their hate, my hate, all of it. I used it to achieve greatness. I am now a general in the Infernal Legions! I have personally beheaded and carved up celestials and won battles against seemingly impossible enemies. I am no mere succubus. I am a personification of rage, war, and hate.\u201d\n\u201cI always knew you\u2019d do well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know what I really hate? YOU. I hate the day I ever met you. I hate that you were instrumental in my current status. I hate that you summoned me back to this pathetic world. I HATE the fact that I love you.\u201d\n\u201cBut without it, where would you be?\u201d\n\nYour last words are too much and Tanya takes a step towards you and backhands you across the face. She probably wasn\u2019t even using half of her strength either and you go sprawling to the ground in a daze.\n\nAfter spitting a bit of blood and rubbing your head a bit, you slowly get back up and that\u2019s when you hear quiet sobbing.\n\nYou look and you see Tanya sitting on the ground with her knees tucked in and her head buried in her arms.\n\nExcept this isn\u2019t the demon of war form that you\u2019ve been seeing. This isn\u2019t even her succubus form. It\u2019s the form of the girl you fell love with. Even her clothes are the same.\n\n\u201cTanya\u2026\u201d you say and walk over to her, but she pulls away a bit when you go to touch her.\n\u201cBut what I hate\u2026(sob) most of all\u2026 is\u2026that we can\u2019t be together\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to say. There isn\u2019t anything you can say. She\u2019s right and it sucks.\n\nInstead you just sit next to her and hold her. She holds on to you back, finally giving in to her human feelings for you, no matter how buried they were.\n\n\u201cI have to go back.\u201d Tanya says with a sniffle.\n\u201cI know, but you could stay, just for a little while. Let\u2019s just enjoy what we have right here. Right now. Hey, we never watched the sunset together, why don\u2019t we do that?\u201d You say.\n\nTanya wipes her eyes and nods.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe pair of you just sit and hold each other in silence for quite awhile as you watch the sunset and then later the stars. One of the benefits of being bonded is not even having to speak. Sometimes one of you remembers a fond moment from your collective past and you both give a smile at each other, even an occasional laugh.\n\nDuring one of those moments, you both look deep into each other\u2019s eyes and you finally move in to kiss. From there, you both do what lovers tend to do.\n\nAnd for those moments of intimacy under the night sky, the pair of you has blocked out everything else and it\u2019s just you two.\n\nAfterwards, the pair of you fall asleep under the stars.\n\nThe next day you wake up. You feel some of the aches from yesterday\u2019s events, but you\u2019re not too bad off. You look and Tanya isn\u2019t next to you and you expect her to be gone, but after looking around a bit, you see her standing by herself (still in her human form) over looking a small cliff by the sea. You walk over to her.\n\n\u201cI sort of figured you\u2019d be gone when I woke up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t leave it like that. You deserve a proper goodbye.\u201d Tanya says still looking at the ocean.\n\u201cNo way you can stay a little longer I guess.\u201d\n\u201cAs nice as last night was, it\u2019s best I don\u2019t get used to it. The longer I stay here, the more I\u2019ll lose myself. I can\u2019t afford that weakness. I know to you I\u2019ll always be that girl you fell in love with, but I assure you I am much more now and very different. I have responsibilities that you couldn\u2019t hope to know.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can imagine leading hell armies is pretty taxing.\u201d\n\nTanya turns to you.\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t judge do you?\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what unconditional love is all about?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI suppose. But it\u2019s one thing to love someone despite them being say a thief. It\u2019s quite another to love someone who has committed genocide on a whole populace.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing they had it coming.\u201d\n\nTanya chuckles at your remark.\n\n\u201cYou always did know how to make me laugh despite my best efforts not to.\u201d Tanya says.\n\u201cBesides, you just informed me that I murdered a bunch of innocent women that I had sex with and blocked it out. I\u2019m hardly in a position to judge you.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOh you didn\u2019t kill all of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill all of them. You missed one, but I sort of get the weird impression that you wouldn\u2019t have anyway. It\u2019s odd. You had some real harmony with that one and it was just a one-night stand. I dare say you didn\u2019t even get to that level with that Vera girl and you knew her quite well.\u201d\n\nYou think for a moment of who Tanya could even be talking about. At first you think it might be Naji, but you only had sex with her before Tanya left. Then you remember.\n\n\u201cWait. That masked blonde at the baroness\u2019 party? Fuck! If I wanted to kill any of them, it would have been her! That bitch fucking picked my pockets while I was asleep and ran off!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cHeh, smart girl. In any case, I never saw in your mind that you killed her, so who knows, maybe if you ever meet her again you should hang on to her, she might just be the one that allows you to get over me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to ever be a girl that does that.\u201d\n\nTanya strokes your face with her hand and gives a faint smile.\n\n\u201cNo. Probably not.\u201d She says and then kisses you one last time.\n\n\u201cPlease do not summon me ever again. Goodbye my love.\u201d\n\nShe steps away from you and before your eyes you see her disappear in a small red flash.\n\nAnd she\u2019s gone again. This time forever.\n\nYou sit on the ground and stare at the ocean for awhile. You weep a bit at your loss and a sense of depression hangs over you. You even briefly consider heading over the cliff, but you dismiss that idea pretty quickly. Suicidal thoughts have never been something you\u2019ve dwelled on and you can only imagine how disgusted Tanya would be with you if you did.\n\nShe\u2019d want you to move on not give up and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll try to do.\n\nYou eventually get back up and decide you probably should be making your way back to Holgard, you can only imagine the shitstorm that\u2019s going on there right now. Though you guess that Gwen will take the initiative and blame everything on Heather (Which is sort of true anyway; you didn\u2019t expect that twist) and take over what\u2019s left of the school.\n\nYou sort of wonder if maybe you should follow up on Gwen\u2019s flirting now, but then would she even be interested any more given what she\u2019s learned about you? You suppose the best way to find out is to just go for it.\n\nIf she isn\u2019t then you\u2019ll move on to someone else. If she is, well you\u2019ll have to remember not to try to kill her and blackout about it.\n\nWith a new positive attitude in mind, you set off towards Holgard.\n\n\u201cGoodbye Tanya.\u201d You say.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Attack the fleet", "result": "Cut off the head and the rest is going to follow.\n\n\u201cWe need to take out that fleet. If Peter gets away, turning back this invasion isn\u2019t going to matter.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd if Ludmilla dies, then what?\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cWell I dunno, but worst case scenario, one of us picks up the pieces and takes over the city instead. Not like we\u2019d do any worse.\u201d\n\nHeather\u2019s a little surprised to hear you say that, though you just sort of came up with it in the moment.\n\n\u201cI still feel very strongly that we should help the baroness. However I guess you have a point about Peter. It\u2019s not ideal, but I guess we\u2019ll have to split up.\u201d\n\u201cSplit up?\u201d\n\u201cYes, seeing as my students held their own against a trained diabolist I\u2019d hope they\u2019d be able to handle some mundane orcs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea, we\u2019re going to need all the firepower we can get!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can handle it myself. Besides, it\u2019ll be a lot harder for them to focus on a single smaller target rather than a group. You should go with my students however. They probably should have someone to back them up for protection. I mean there\u2019s not much you can do to help against a bunch of ships anyway. Speaking of crews, where is the rest of your people?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask, in fact after this is all over I might not even have any people. Anyway, I still think splitting up is a bad idea, but I guess if you say you can handle it yourself, I trust you.\u201d\n\nWith as much rest as you\u2019re going to get under these conditions, you and the student wizards are soon on your way to the palace. Heather parts ways with you, but you really wish she didn\u2019t. She still looked very tired for one thing and you\u2019re not entirely convinced that you shouldn\u2019t focus on one thing instead of splitting up.\n\nYou don\u2019t have many problems on the way there, but you do come across a few unexpected faces.

Um, we\u2019ve managed to save couple of our brothels from getting too fucked up. We\u2019ve also been having people take the whores back to headquarters and stay there until it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear we\u2019re making Holgard safe for whores again at least.\u201d\n\nYou get an idea.\n\n\u201cOkay, you lot are going with these wizards to the palace. I want you to do everything in your power to protect them. Seriously, it\u2019s the most important thing in the world right now.\u201d You say and start walking off.\n\u201cWait, where are you going boss?\u201d\n\u201cI got protection of my own to do. Don\u2019t worry about me. Just do what I tell you!\u201d\n\nNot questioning your leadership again, your people follow your orders and you run off towards the docks. You just hope Heather managed to get there since your own trip to the docks isn\u2019t without struggle.\n\nWhen you finally get within sight of the docks you see several ships burning and sinking into the water. Looks like Heather is already getting to work as you see a lone figure running about casting magic into the bay area.\n\nYou run towards her and then immediately have to take cover as the sounds of several cannons are fired in Heather\u2019s (and your) direction.\n\nThe area was already half destroyed from the initial attack and pillaging, but with Heather\u2019s recent attack on his fleet, Peter is determined to destroy the entire harbor and then some.\n\nAs you hide behind a partially destroyed building. Deafening explosions are all around you. Temporary loss of hearing aside, you\u2019re otherwise fine. You look out from the rubble and still see Heather encased in a glowing blue shield of some sort. However, you also see several smaller boats rowing towards docks. Heather\u2019s putting up a good fight, but you need to go help her.\n\nYou run towards Heather and another cannon explosion hits not far from you. The force is enough to throw you to the ground and you\u2019re pelted by bits of debris. With your head now bleeding and feeling dizzy, you slowly stand back up only for another nearby explosion to knock you back down again.\n\nThis time you struggle to push yourself up and look up just in time to see Heather fighting off some of the sailors that have managed to get to the docks (or what\u2019s left of them).\n\nYou stand up and begin firing wildly at the sailors though Heather is easily destroying them with a chain lightning spell.\n\nWith the wave of Peter\u2019s men dead, Heather takes a quick breather and it\u2019s at that moment she finally notices you. She nods. You nod.\n\nAnd then another volley of cannons fires off and completely obliterates everything in front of you.\n\nYou fly backwards and eventually slam into something made of harder stuff than you are and you go unconscious.\n\nYou\u2019re out for who knows how long, but by the time you wake up it\u2019s dark and the sounds of battle have died down though your hearing still isn\u2019t very good and your head is throbbing.\n\nYou stagger around a bit before getting your bearings. In this darkness several burning fires provide most of the nearby illumination. It\u2019s nothing but destruction everywhere.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey you!\u201d a voice calls out.\n\nYou spin around and see five men dressed for battle. They don\u2019t look like Holgard Watch either. You nearly go for your pistol and that\u2019s when you realize you don\u2019t have it anymore. The only weapon you currently have on you is a dagger still in its sheath and you\u2019re not likely to succeed a confrontation in your condition.\n\nYou could run, but you\u2019re still a bit dazed and they\u2019re already almost on you.\n\n\u201cWho are you? We\u2019re trying to clear the streets of people right now and don\u2019t need anyone skulking about! Where is your home?\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cHuh? I\u2026I live\u2026um\u2026in Teckleville.\u201d You say desperately trying to find the words to get out of this.\n\u201cTeckleville? Never heard of it! What the hell are you doing out here then?\u201d\n\u201cI was\u2026 I was visiting my sister.\u201d\n\u201cVisiting your sister? Was she a whore here?\u201d the man laughs along with his fellows.\n\u201cNo\u2026I look\u2026my head really hurts and I\u2019m a little dizzy\u2026\u201d\n\nThe man suddenly grabs you by the shirt and slams you up against a nearby destroyed wall.\n\n\u201cMore than your head is going to hurt if you don\u2019t start answering my questions! You say you were here to visit your sister, but that smells like bullshit to me! You look like a common thief trying to take advantage of the chaos! Well that shit ain\u2019t gonna pass now that Baron Peter Varsakken is in charge!\u201d\n\u201cPeter Varsakken?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah! He visited his sister too and decided he liked the city so much that he took it in the name of the Delantium Kingdom!\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s it. The struggle has been lost and you need to get the hell out of here somehow.\n\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m no thief! I\u2019m just a bard and I was just here visiting my sister when the\u2026liberation began. The baroness\u2019 men wouldn\u2019t let anyone leave and killed anyone who tried! Not to mention my sister was scared so of course I stayed with her. When the fighting got really bad even her home wasn\u2019t safe and looters\u2026(choke) took her. I tried to fight, but I\u2019m not a fighting man and it was just luck that I was only smashed in the head and left for dead. I later got up and tried to find her, but\u2026the violence\u2026I never saw so much violence before\u2026I thought of my sister\u2026and\u2026(Sniffle).\u201d\n\nThe man that grabbed you relents slightly with his grip.\n\n\u201cI just sort of got lost trying to hide from the bloodshed and before I knew it there was an explosion and I woke up here. Now I don\u2019t know where my sister is and I fear the worst\u2026(sob).\u201d You say really trying to put on the tears by rubbing your eyes a lot.\n\nThe military soldiers look at each other and the one that grabbed you pulls you off the wall and begins motioning you to go.\n\n\u201cFine. Get out of here. Go on back to your village or wherever you come from bard. And remember to sing the song of Peter Varsakken\u2019s glorious victory here today!\u201d the man shouts and give you one last shove before moving on.\n\nNow free, you hurry along the way and find the quickest sewer entrance and enter. You figure you can move around down there with less hassle and get out of the city quicker.\n\nYou briefly wonder if you should go back to your headquarters to check if there is anyone there, but really it\u2019s still better to just get the hell out as quickly as possible. Besides, the Nocturnal League has practically got to be dead here now. Might as well move on to your back up plan, which is to head to Jicol.\n\nYou eventually get out of Holgard and with your hands you dig up your private stash that you hid in the nearby wilderness. You figure you got enough coin for a trip to Jicol though you\u2019re going to have to walk to the nearest city which Klyton.\n\nIt\u2019s a long walk too, but fortunately the route from Holgard is no longer impeded as much by a lot of woods and roads are much more prominent now. With any luck, you\u2019ll run into a Klyton carriage on its way to Holgard and you can tell them the news and get a ride back.\n\nOne month later...\n\n\u201cJicol huh? Yeah I guess I can take you along, but not for free obviously.\u201d The trader says.\n\u201cWill this suffice?\u201d you reply and show him a few platinum coins.\n\u201cYeah, that will do it. You\u2019ll have to sleep in the cargo hold though and if I find out you\u2019ve messed about with any of the goods down there, well if you aren\u2019t familiar with the term keelhauling, you\u2019ll become very familiar. We leave tomorrow morning. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\nYou leave the trader and head back to where you\u2019ve been currently staying in Hessla. You thought you\u2019d never get a ship to take you to Jicol. Less ships have been coming through Hessla lately thanks to the invasion at Holgard. Also all known pirates have been banned from entering Jicol. You guess that\u2019s why not many ships from here are currently allowed to travel there.\n\nThe next day you board the trader ship and make your way to the cargo hold which contains mostly spices and cloth material that you\u2019d have no interest in stealing anyway.\n\nYou imagine it\u2019s going to be months before you actually arrive in Jicol, and it\u2019s probably not going to be a comfortable trip either. On the plus side, you\u2019ll be glad to eventually see Vera after this miserable time.\n\nDays pass into weeks and you more or less keep to yourself and just eat with the rest of the crew when its time then go back to your place in the cargo hold.\n\nThen as you\u2019re sleeping one day\u2026\n\n\u201cOh come on! This is bullshit! I\u2019m a fucking registered citizen of Hessla you can\u2019t fucking rob me!\u201d a voice says. Sounds like the trader.\n\u201cApologies, but shit is tough all over nowadays. Besides you need to relax, we\u2019re not taking all of it. Just a little bit.\u201d A deeper voice says.\n\u201cThe Governor of Hessla is going to hear about this Zamed! There are certain laws in place for a reason!\u201d\n\u201cTelling the Governor of Hessla? You think that\u2019s a wise thing to be threatening me with Flint given the circumstances?\u201d\n\nYou hear the name Zamed and your immediately sit up and accidently hit your head, cursing in the process.\n\n\u201cWho else is down here Flint?!\u201d Zamed says\n\u201cJust some extra passenger that paid coin.\u201d Flint responds.\n\nBefore you know it, you see Zamed and some of his people along with the trader. You aren\u2019t sure how this is going to go, but you\u2019re ready to pull your pistol. You just wish it was multiple shots like your old one.\n\nZamed squints a little and then speaks.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. I know you. Shit, thought you died in Holgard.\u201d Zamed says.\n\u201cAlmost did.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell Flint, this is your lucky day. You can keep all your cargo, I\u2019ll just be taking this one.\u201d\n\u201cI thought pirates were currently banned from Jicol.\u201d\n\u201cJicol? Oh wait, you actually think I was going to take you there? To Vera?\u201d\n\u201cCall me an optimist.\u201d\n\u201cWrong day for optimism, friend. No, gonna take you to the Syndicate. They\u2019ll pay a nice price for you. Not sure what you did to piss them off, but they really got it in for you.\u201d\n\u201cI figured those orcs weren\u2019t just wrecking my businesses on accident.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. Well we can do this the easy way or the hard way. The choice is yours.\u201d\n\u201cNot gonna be the easy way I can tell you that, and if you attempt to do this the hard way, you\u2019ll have a bullet in your head before you can make another step.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, Vera always went on about how great you were with a pistol. She always bragged about you. The way I see it, if you were so great then why the hell did she betray you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cClueless idiot. Vera\u2019s been in cahoots with the Syndicate for a long time now. She was also in on the whole invasion. If anything I\u2019m saving you time because if you got to Jicol, she would have only turned your ass in to the Syndicate herself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t believe you. Vera would never betray me, let alone hand me over to the Syndicate!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s of minor importance. However, you may be right about her not turning you in, she always was a little too sweet on you. Talking about you even after we\u2026y\u2019know what? Fuck this, I can just bring in your head\u2026\u201d\n\nZamed pulls his pistol and you fire landing one right between his eyes as promised. However this isn\u2019t enough to deter the rest of his men who rush at you.\n\nYou fight with your sword as best you can, but eventually you are cut down.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Help her students", "result": "Heather\u2019s a powerful wizard and can probably take care of herself. Her students on the other hand you\u2019re not so sure of and you\u2019re going to need all the magic help possible if you\u2019re going to turn back this invasion.\n\nIf you can take out the opposing wizard, that would probably break the stalemate and then you all can help Heather if still necessary. You figure if you can sneak in range and get off a shot, you\u2019ll kill the wizard and dispel the demons he keeps warping in.\n\nWell that\u2019s the ideal plan anyway.\n\nYou sneak around a few buildings trying to stay away from the direction of the fighting and getting closer hoping the whole time nobody notices you. Eventually you go into a partially destroyed building and get to the third floor of it to take your shot since you figure you\u2019ll at least be out of immediate danger of the demons suddenly turning around and attacking you.\n\nTaking aim, your pull the trigger and shoot the wizard in the back. You were aiming for his head, but it seems to have done the trick anyway as the wizard goes down. All that magic and you figured he neglected a protection spell against more mundane dangers.\n\nWhether the bullet killed him or not doesn\u2019t really matter since the demons warping in aren\u2019t under his control anymore and instead of immediately getting themselves killed by the students, a couple of them attack the easy prey on the ground instead. You watch a couple of them take chunks from the wizard and go bounding away.\n\nThe students make quick work of most of the remaining demons that do insist on continuing their attack. Meanwhile, you\u2019re making your way back down to go meet up with the students now that the demon threat is over with.\n\nYou exit the partially destroyed building and still see that Heather is fighting her opponent on the roof of the intact building. She needs help fast and you begin shouting at the students when you get closer to them.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey! I\u2019m on your side! Heather needs help! Look!\u201d you shout pointing up and towards the roof.\n\nNo sooner have you done that, when they start shouting back and it looks like they\u2019re prepping spells.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuc\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nFeeling in danger you immediately start firing at the students. A couple of them go down, cuasing the rest to scatter a bit and a few magic bolts go wild in your direction missing you.\n\nUnfortunately they also miss the demons they were trying to hit behind you.\n\nYour shouting caused the escaped demons that you thought left the area to come back for seconds on another easy target. You hear the growls and turn around just in time for one of them to almost be on you.\n\nThe last thing you see are inhuman jaws enclosing on your face followed by a sickening crunch sound.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Talk to Peter first", "result": "Vera\u2019s usually got good instincts, if she\u2019s saying that you should at least speak with Peter, then you probably should do it. You can always speak to Heather after you come back depending on how the meeting goes.\n\n\u201cAlright Vera, I\u2019ll meet with Peter. However, I want you to stay here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait, why?\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cBecause if anything happens I want to make sure someone competent is still in charge of the League. I trust Zamed will be fine in taking just me correct?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll talk to him, though I really think it would be better if we both went.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, as I said, I want someone in charge around here. I certainly can\u2019t entrust it all to Warts can I?\u201d\n\u201cHah, guess not. Okay, I\u2019ll speak to Zamed that went he leaves, you\u2019ll be coming with him and he can come pick me up when you return.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and tell him to make room for ten hobs as well. No way in hell I\u2019m going without at least some back up even if this Peter\u2019s got a whole army behind him.\u201d\n\nVera nods and leaves to go presumably talk to Zamed. Meanwhile you\u2019ve got to get ready for your first trip aboard a ship.\n\nWhen you finally board the Traveller, Zamed greets you and shows you to where you\u2019ll be staying on his ship.\n\n\u201cThis will be fine.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI should certainly hope so, these are the quarters of some of my own crew. As a favor to Vera, I have allowed you to bring aboard your\u2026greenskins and provided comfortable accommodations. I certainly hope your savages don\u2019t get sick all over my ship.\u201d\n\nZamed\u2019s comments are enough to draw some mean looks from your hobs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d watch your choice of words if you want the greenskins to remain less savage.\u201d You say.\n\u201cPfft. This is MY fucking ship. I\u2019ll speak how I please. You all had best remember that.\u201d Zamed replies.\n\u201cAnd YOU had best remember that if anything out of the ordinary should happen to me on this trip, you\u2019re not going to survive long enough to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nZamed now gives you a look like he wants to do something, but instead spits near your feet and walks away. You tell your hobs to keep close to you and be ready for anything.\n\nYou certainly hope your meeting with Peter goes better.\n\nYour time aboard the Traveller goes by slowly as there isn\u2019t much to do except wait. You don\u2019t interact much with Zamed and the rest of the crew for obvious reasons. The only thing Zamed tells you is you\u2019re heading towards an island with a small fishing town called Seabreeze which is under Delantium dominion. Peter apparently wants to keep major meetings with criminals away from the mainland for whatever reason.\n\nHobs are great at protection, but not much for conversation (And unfortunately most of them DO get sick on the trip, apparently hobs don\u2019t take well to sailing), so you mainly just do a lot of thinking about what you\u2019re going to say to Peter when you finally meet him.\n\nAfter a couple weeks pass you finally get to your destination. An even larger ship is in the all too small harbor of Seabreeze. That one must be Peter\u2019s. Between his ship and the Traveller, there\u2019s barely any room for the small fishing boats to squeeze in.\n\nEventually you disembark and several armored men equipped with muskets and swords meet you and Zamed.\n\n\u201cYou are Zamed, correct?\u201d one of the higher ranking looking ones asks.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Zamed answers.\n\u201cThe rightful Baron Peter Varsakken has half of your payment ready. You will receive the other half afterwards as agreed. If you follow these men, they will take you to it. Your men will stay here.\u201d\n\nZamed doesn\u2019t look too concerned about going by himself and just shrugs and follows the Delantium soldiers. The one who was speaking now turns to you.\n\n\u201cYou can return to your ship. Your captain will be back shortly.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my captain. I came here on behalf of the Nocturnal League organization in Holgard.\u201d You say.\n\nThe man is taken aback.\n\n\u201cI see. I did not know that such a meeting had been arranged.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cNeither did I, this was sort of sprung on me at the last second. I was however told by a subordinate that Peter\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cBARON PETER.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026the Baron\u2026was looking for all the allies he could get in his quest to take back what was rightfully stolen from him.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, indeed he was seeking out potential allies on the inside. I was not however aware that it was more criminals. We have enough of that lot with these pirates masquerading as privateers. Still, Baron Peter Varsakken is a pragmatic man and will listen to what you have to say. Your greenskins will have to stay here and you will turn your weapons over to me obviously.\u201d\n\nYou really don\u2019t like this idea, but you\u2019re here now so you might as well go all the way with it. However, you\u2019re not giving your weapons over to this Delantium tight ass. You instead hand them to one of your hobs and tell them to go back to the ship. This is fine with the Delantium solder and he tells you to follow him.\n\nYou take a brief walk through the small town of Seabreeze which seems like this is the most attention it\u2019s received in a long time. The inhabitants watch everything.\n\nSoon, you stop at a run down little tavern called the Jolly Lobster. (A much happier sounding name than taverns in Holgard that\u2019s for sure) Surprisingly the place is filled with more Delantium soldiers not doing much of anything except enjoying their drink. Among them is a regal looking man who is probably about your age. You\u2019re guessing that\u2019s probably Peter. He doesn\u2019t look quite how you expected. He seems like he would be more than capable in a fight.\n\nThe soldier who escorted you here explains to Peter the situation and his attention is immediately caught. He tells the rest of the soldiers at his table to clear so that you may sit and talk.\n\nAs you do so, Peter is already studying you. Delantium soldiers sitting nearby also stare at you.\n\n\u201cYou nervous?\u201d Peter asks.\n\u201cI\u2019d be a fool if I didn\u2019t have some concerns about my current situation. Though I wasn\u2019t really here to insult you or show disrespect, I was here about a potential alliance. My intentions are nothing but positive.\u201d\n\u201cYour intentions are nothing but self serving. You sense change is coming and you want to be on the right side when it comes. It\u2019s perfectly understandable. You are the leader of the infamous Nocturnal League correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nPeter nods.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much information on you, but I do have enough to know that you have an uncanny knack of survival. The Ebony Claw Syndicate provided some of that information.\u201d\n\u201cHm, from what I heard, you weren\u2019t exactly friendly with them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say things change. Sometimes old antagonists can be new allies, or at least non-antagonists. In fact you happen to be one reason why the Syndicate isn\u2019t actively sabotaging me this time. Indeed, when I liberate Holgard, some of the orc mercenaries that the Syndicate provided will be actively targeting the Nocturnal League. They aren\u2019t exactly happy with you for some reason.\u201d\n\nWell this is news. You aren\u2019t sure if you should be happy or uneasy that Peter is so freely admitting this.\n\n\u201cI have an idea of why, but what I don\u2019t understand is why you would tell me directly.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I have no real love for the Syndicate. Honestly, I\u2019m just using them for their help in taking back Holgard. I really don\u2019t care if they succeed in their petty revenge against you. That being said, I don\u2019t care about you either. Your organization, if it survives will be a thorn in the Delantium law I intend to re-establish in Holgard and will be dealt with eventually anyway. With this information you could stay and fight which will result in your death either during or after the liberation or you could leave to save yourself. Either way, your organization will not plague Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve made up your mind.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. You\u2019re here so I figure you have something to say. Perhaps you can convince me of your worth.\u201d\n\nPeter looks at you and leans in.\n\n\u201cSo convince me.\u201d\n\nYou take a moment to gather up some of the things you thought about saying to Peter and then throw out most of it before you speak.\n\nYou tell Peter that a criminal element will always exist in some way in a city as large as Holgard. Better that he deal with a friendly crime lord who can maintain order over it rather than wasting time attempting to stomp it all out. You also remind him that without you around, the Syndicate will definitely attempt to re-establish a presence back in the city and they engage in activities much worse like slave trading than your organization does.\n\nYou also say you can easily provide skirmish support as your group is very familiar with the city and the sewers in particular. You\u2019d be able to help pick off Ludmilla\u2019s troops.\n\nPeter seems in intrigued by your arguments, but he doesn\u2019t show any positivity in your favor until you mention that you might be able to get the mages in Holgard on his side.\n\n\u201cIf you manage to do that, I will certainly take your organization\u2019s right to exist in Holgard into consideration.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s about the best you do with Peter. The rest of the discussion is mainly him going on about what he intends to change and similar things. He surprisingly doesn\u2019t ask you much about Ludmilla even though you mention that you met her.\n\nSoon, he says that he has more important business to attend to and dismisses you at which point several soldiers escort you out and most of the way to the Traveller.\n\nThe only thing going through your mind during this is that you\u2019d probably be better off not allying with Peter. Even if Heather is receptive to the idea of switching sides, it\u2019s still no safety guarantee for you.\n\nThe question remains if you\u2019re going to stay in Holgard and fight or just run off to Jicol and run things there. It\u2019s certainly the easier and safer solution.\n\nWhen you finally board the Traveller, you\u2019re getting harder stares than you normally are by Zamed\u2019s crew. You also notice a few of them look a little beat up and their clothing is torn.\n\nYou chalk it up to perhaps some internal squabble and then when you return to your quarters that\u2019s when you realize what\u2019s happened.\n\nThe quarters where you and the hobs were staying at is a wreck. While there aren\u2019t any bodies it\u2019s obvious what happened with all the blood everywhere.\n\nYou immediately search the quarters hoping that you can find a weapon of some sort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing your hobs still weren\u2019t feeling their best, might have been a more difficult fight. Looking for this?\u201d Zamed says.\n\nYou turn around and see him holding your repeating pistol.\n\n\u201cExcellent workmanship. Not sure how you came across it, but rest assured it will be in better hands, much like Vera.\u201d Zamed says.\n\u201cIs this what this is about? I\u2019ve never even fucked Vera and never made a move on her!\u201d you say.\n\u201cPerhaps not, but she talks about you constantly. Always goes on about how great you are. The way I see it, if you were so great then why the hell did she betray you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cClueless idiot. Vera\u2019s been in cahoots with the Syndicate for a long time now. In fact that\u2019s what this is really about anyway. I\u2019m turning your ass in to the Syndicate for a shitload of coin.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t believe you. Vera would never betray me!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s of minor importance. However, you might be right, she might still be a little too sweet on you and I doubt if she\u2019ll believe any story I come up with. Better to just not bother picking her up. Oh well. It was good while it lasted, but as for you, you\u2019re on your way out.\u201d\n\nZamed points your pistol at you and fires hitting you in the chest.

It\u2019s a shitty situation, but you\u2019re doing what you got to do to survive it.\n\nNot that you have some great love for the Felians, and you don\u2019t even mind Heather, but who knows what the hell her real agenda is if she\u2019s making friends in high places. Plus better the devil you know than the one you don\u2019t.\n\nAll that remains is somehow warning Gloom about the orb. It\u2019s going to be tough considering you convinced him to take it in the first place. Last thing you want to happen is to arouse suspicion from him.\n\nUpon thinking about it you decide you\u2019ll just have to take Heather by surprise when you accompany Gloom on his invasion of the temple. She\u2019ll be expecting you to be on her side, so you should have the drop on her and her people. You\u2019ll need to make those shots count and attempt to take cover immediately.\n\nAfter the battle, you can claim ignorance about the orb and just tell Gloom that she must have been attempting to kill you by giving you a non-working one in the first place.\n\nThe night of the attack comes and you meet with Gloom just a few blocks away from the Dornan Temple, you have your usual hob retinue with you. (You\u2019re really getting used to having these guys around nowadays) Gloom is with a few of his own people, but even without magic powers you can sense some are probably nearby in the shadows.\n\n\u201cOnce again, glad that this is a joint effort though I don\u2019t think it was necessary to bring as many people with you as you did. The orb is going to nullify all magic and when that happens, those Dornan priests aren\u2019t going to be much match for us.\u201d Gloom says.\n\u201cYeah, well I want to be on the safe side. We\u2019ll come in with your people.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI appreciate it. This is something that\u2019s been a long time coming. Honestly, it was foolish to believe they wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Shadow Master Shade warned me to always watch them you know, just before he died. A few of his interpretations of the faith may have been a bit too restrictive, but he had his own wisdom on practical matters.\u201d\n\nWith those last words all of you march towards the temple. The few wanderers still outside in the area immediately go find shelter when they see a group of mean looking hobgoblins and Felians walking down the street.\n\nThe Dornan Temple doesn\u2019t even have their usual lookout standing outside, though you imagine the Dornans have some sort of magical detection going on and this plan has already been expected.\n\nGloom blasts the temple\u2019s doors off their hinges with a dark magic bolt of some sort. Then he takes the lead, you tell your hobgoblins to rush forward for the kill as soon as the orb is dropped. They faithfully obey and you all enter with the crowd of Felians that are entering the temple.\n\nHeather and her much smaller group are already there to meet the Felians.\n\n\u201cIt ends today and the faith of Fel will rule supreme in the city at last!\u201d Gloom shouts and throws down the orb. A bit more dramatic than you\u2019d expect from a Felian, but then Gloom\u2019s whole attack tonight is a bit more theatrical than a typical Felian would go about this. Good thing too, since if he behaved more like his predecessors he wouldn\u2019t be going in so recklessly like this.\n\nNo sooner has Gloom made his announcement, a white light washes over the room and suddenly all of Gloom\u2019s previously shadow cloaked people are now visible. Naturally Gloom just assumes this is just the effects of the orb, but he\u2019s soon very surprised to learn that the Dornans have not lost any of their magic abilities at all.\n\nKnowing what\u2019s really going on, you waste no time in firing at Heather while your hobs rush forward to attack.\n\nA couple of the Dornan acolytes are cut down as they were caught completely off guard by this, however your own attack has proven ineffective against Heather who apparently had a protective spell up just in case you decided to betray her.\n\nIn fact as the bullets fail to hurt her, she just turns her head and looks at you with a minor head shake.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d\n\nThey may be a small group, but this temple is where their magic is the most powerful.\n\nMost of your hobs are incinerated instantly by the remaining Dornan spells. A lot of the Felians too, before Gloom orders a retreat. He doesn\u2019t make it out though before he\u2019s brought down by some spell that causes him to age rapidly and then fall over dead.\n\nYou don\u2019t make it out either. A spell freezes you in place and while you helplessly watch others escape or die in front of you, you can only imagine what grim fate Heather has in store for you after this is over.\n\nAs it turns out, Heather\u2019s imagination is a lot darker than yours.

If I backstab the Felians so easily after being allied with them, would you ever truly trust me?\u201d you say.\n\nHeather\u2019s look of hopefulness drops.\n\n\u201cNo. No I suppose I wouldn\u2019t.

The best I can do if they do ask for help is tell them that their little war with you is their own affair and not in the best business interest of the League.

It\u2019s been a busy day.\nA couple days pass and the time to meet up with Percy is at hand and you haven\u2019t been looking forward to it.\n\nYou meet Percy at the same tavern with the payment. Once again he\u2019s very friendly.\n\n\u201cOn time as usual. Very glad that you value promptness as I am in a bit of a hurry. I believe I may have had too much fun here and I should be getting back. I thank you for your suggestions on where to go.\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cNo problem, so will you be back next month at this time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cProbably not me, but someone will. Probably of much lesser importance of course. I was just here this time to extend the hand and make the deal as it were. Still glad we came to one.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I agree. Better for business all around.\u201d\n\u201cYes! Yes exactly!\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, I have your payment. It\u2019s right outside loaded on that carriage you probably passed on your way in here.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I trust the correct amount is in those chests. I mean I\u2019m sure it is, but I think you know the issues that would occur if that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m quite aware.\n\u201cGood, and with that, our business is concluded. I bid you good day and wish you well in your future endeavors, especially if it\u2019s going to make the Syndicate money!\u201d\n\nPercy stands up, shakes your hand and leaves.\n\nYou\u2019re really going to hate this new arrangement. You send a message off to Vera explaining the situation.\n\nOver the next few months, you start to really hate it as you start to feel the crunch of not having that extra surplus anymore. It\u2019s not really much of a problem for you personally per say, but the rest of the League members aren\u2019t exactly happy paying more dues as it were.\n\nIn fact when the Felians actually come to you for assistance on wiping out the Dornans, you legitimately have an excuse that you can\u2019t spare the people and it\u2019s not cost effective to do so. As expected Gloom is not very happy with you not helping, though you point out that you\u2019re not happy that he just suddenly sprung this on you and attempt to deflect the blame by claiming he was keeping secrets from you about his private war with the Dornans.\n\nThe ultimate results of that skirmish is eventual defeat of the Dornans, though with a very high cost to the Felians. The Felians wind up having less numbers than the Dornans had when the faction war was restarted. Little more than a handful and Gloom isn\u2019t counted among them any longer.\n\nThe new leader Dusk doesn\u2019t even renew contact with you and instead the temple returns to an isolationist mindset, keeping to themselves. You guess you\u2019ve lost the Felians as an ally, but you\u2019re not quite concerned about that given how low their numbers are.\n\nAround this time you get a message back from Vera who expresses concern about the new developments with the Syndicate.\n\nShe goes on to say that she\u2019ll be in Holgard in a few months with her usual cut. She says when she gets there you and her should speak more on this since it\u2019s a conversation that should take place in person.\n\nYou\u2019ll be looking forward to her thoughts on this matter since while things haven\u2019t gone to complete shit yet, you get the impression it won\u2019t be long.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\nIt\u2019s been awhile, but it\u2019s good to see Vera again even if she\u2019s just here for a visit. She\u2019s got some strong opinions on some of the changes that have happened recently though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if staying neutral was the best decision. We probably should have directly helped the Felians. They were our allies after all and now we don\u2019t have any.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cWe still have an understanding with the Baroness. So, we\u2019re not that bad off.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI suppose, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s something I need to talk to you about because it could possibly affect the League.\u201d\n\u201cWell guess I better hear it then.\u201d\n\nVera takes a drink of the rum she\u2019s brought with her from Jicol before continuing.\n\n\u201cOkay, I guess I\u2019ll start at the beginning. Let\u2019s see\u2026what do you know of Peter Varsakken? Youngest son of Vlad.\u201d Vera asks.\n\u201cUm, nothing actually. Didn\u2019t know there was another one of Vlad\u2019s spawn running around. Wait, is this another one of his bastards, like you?\u201d you ask with a smirk.\n\u201cOh no. He\u2019s very much legitimate. It\u2019s just that after he had a disagreement with his father and fled the city, all records were pretty much erased of him. He\u2019s basically been living in exile in the Delantium Kingdom. Peter\u2019s disagreement with his father involved the whole breaking away from the Delantium Kingdom in the first place. Peter was the only one who saw it as treason and remained loyal to Delantium. Over the years Peter has been trying to amass an army to take back the city.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that the Delantium Kingdom hasn\u2019t exactly been in a big hurry to retake this place. I mean it\u2019s been decades hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019ve been sort of busy with other things, like their recent war with Nichan for example. While the ruling class over there doesn\u2019t want to spend their resources and treasury to take this place back, they certainly won\u2019t turn down someone else willing to do the job, and that\u2019s where Peter comes in. He\u2019s of noble birth, loyal to the kingdom and would be an excellent governor for this city and absorb it back into Delantium\u2019s fold.\u201d\n\u201cI see, and how do you know all this?\u201d\n\u201cThe captain who brought me here, Zamed has been privateering for the Delantium Kingdom. He was contacted by Peter who is still trying to amass a conquering force of men and ships to take back his birthright. In fact Zamed is supposed to be organizing the majority of a flotilla of Hessla privateers\u201d\n\u201cAnd you trust this pirate?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, but I trust the fact that I know how to lay it down good enough that he told me all this stuff in the bedroom without me even asking.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t need details on that part.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, Peter\u2019s been at this for years ever since he got exiled. He\u2019s suffered many set backs in his quest to retake Holgard. Every time he\u2019s been on the verge of being ready, something has happened. This was partially thanks to the Ebony Claw Syndicate sabotaging his efforts in Delantium, and sometimes even the Temple of Fel would hinder his efforts as well. However, since things have changed drastically over the years in this city, he\u2019s in the best position he\u2019s ever been in to retake this place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think he won\u2019t get sabotaged again by either group? I mean the Ebony Claw might not have a direct presence here, but they\u2019re still making some coin from us. Same is somewhat true of the Felians, though different reasons. They\u2019re allies with the ECS, so they tend to help them and it isn\u2019t like the Felian Temple here is our enemy even if they aren\u2019t aligned or in any position to do anything in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019m just not sure if the Baroness is a sure thing in the future. If Peter invades and assuming the League here survives the chaos of it, from what I\u2019ve heard Peter is lot more of a law and order fanatic than his father and siblings. He\u2019s going to re-establish Delantium law here and that means a whole lot less freedom.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think I should make a deal with this Peter Varsakken?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, if I thought that might help, I might suggest it, but even if that was successful, you\u2019re still kicking a hell of a lot of coin to not just the Holgard government in bribes, but to the ECS for their cut as well. And that will be true even if Peter doesn\u2019t invade Holgard or fails.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you suggesting?\u201d\n\nVera touches you hand.\n\n\u201cLeave here and come to Jicol.\u201d Vera says.\n\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t do that, I got shit to run here. Who am I going to leave in charge? Warts?\u201d\n\u201cLeave whoever you want in charge. I\u2019m suggesting that you completely abandon Holgard. I dunno, maybe make a deal with the Syndicate. Hand Holgard over to them as a one time pay off to not be taxed anymore. Our territory can be Jicol and they can have the rest. Seems like they might go for that.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be severe pay cut and I\u2019m not fond of the idea of running away.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, that\u2019s pride talking. Fuck pride. I mean this place is potentially standing in the way of a shitstorm and I\u2019d rather pull you out of its direction. And while it might be a drop in coin, trust me we do just fine in Jicol. We\u2019ll do even better if we aren\u2019t paying off the Syndicate anymore too.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m interested in just HOW well you\u2019re doing in Jicol. I mean I figured you were always holding back a bit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019ve NEVER skimmed off the top! While it is true much coin has been made under my management of the League, you\u2019ve always gotten your cut! However\u2026if you decide to come to Jicol, you may as well know, I do have a side business for my own independent of the League.\u201d\n\u201cOf your own, what would\u2026\u201d\n\nYou suddenly know immediately what Vera is engaged in.\n\n\u201c\u2026oh wait. Shit. You\u2019re in the slave trade again aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t move away from yours, instead she just squeezes yours a bit more.\n\n\u201cI know! I know! I should have told you sooner, but it seemed cowardly in a letter and I felt I should at least tell you in person! I know you\u2019re not fond of slavery, but the location and demand was too good to pass up in Jicol. I\u2019d be a fool if I didn\u2019t excel in something I was skilled in.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose I can\u2019t fault you for that. (Sigh)\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t yelling and screaming, I trust you\u2019re not mad?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I mean I\u2019m hardly in a position to judge on any moral grounds and I don\u2019t even give a shit about the extra coin you\u2019re making. It\u2019s just\u2026I dunno. Slavery is just one of those things I feel\u2026icky about. Don\u2019t ask me why.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it any different than making some dumb ass addicted to Purple Wish? They basically become a slave to the drug.\u201d\n\u201cThe dumb asses getting addicted to Purple Wish have a choice. Look, as I said, I\u2019m not pissed or anything like that, but if I was to come to Jicol, I\u2019d have some strong feeling about you continuing your slave trade business. In any case I\u2019m still not convinced that I should just run away. Speaking with Peter Varsakken would at least be a better idea, though I\u2019m not exactly sure how I\u2019d go about setting up a meeting with him\u2026wait a minute, that pirate of yours Zamed. He wouldn\u2019t happen to be meeting him anytime soon would he?\u201d\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s going to meet him after he leaves. In fact he tried to convince me that I should go with him, but I didn\u2019t see much point with the League attempting to ally with Peter for the same reasons I told you.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, maybe I should go with him and try to meet with Peter. Feel him out and see if there is any potential there.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. That really seems like a bad idea. I really wish you would just come to Jicol instead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that Vera\u2019s desire for you to go to Jicol is more than just pragmatic reasons. The girl is obviously carrying feelings for you. Always has most likely. If things were different, you might be more inclined to jump at the chance, but this fucking curse is sort of preventing you from such a thing, but that\u2019s not really your immediate concern right now.\n\nStill, you aren\u2019t totally dismissing that idea. Vera usually has good instincts about this sort of thing so it might very well be a good idea to get the hell out of Holgard.\n\nThen again, there\u2019s no certainty that Peter\u2019s even going to win, assuming he even invades in the first place.

A freak tidal wave destroying the city?\n\nSeems like there is always some major shit going on in Holgard that affects the whole damn place and you\u2019re starting to wonder if it isn\u2019t just you that\u2019s cursed, but the whole fucking city.\n\nFuck it, why not?

However, I obviously still can\u2019t just pick up a leave, I need to get shit together first. Might take a few weeks considering that I have to contact the Syndicate and who knows how long they\u2019ll take to get back with me, though I\u2019m hoping fairly quick if I\u2019m telling them about handing over Holgard to them.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course. The rumors about Peter\u2019s invasion are he won\u2019t be ready for another year at least.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well in any case, I\u2019m still going to try to speed this up with the Syndicate. After that, then I can get the hell out of this city.\u201d\n\nVera at this point goes on about how she\u2019s glad that you\u2019re doing this. She also apologizes if she over stepped a boundary by touching your hand the way she did since she\u2019s aware of your whole \u201cnot fucking co-workers\u201d policy. She goes on to say that she just sometimes feels very close to you and probably due to not seeing you for awhile combined with all the mess that\u2019s been going on caused her to briefly display greater affection. She says it won\u2019t happen again.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure about Vera\u2019s feelings towards you or her slave trading, but you can address those later when you get there. The first major step is negotiating with the Syndicate since you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re actually going to let you walk away or not. If they don\u2019t, well that might put a crimp in your plans.\n\nYou soon say goodbye to Vera and start getting things in order. The Syndicate rep should be by in another week, you figure you can tell him directly that you wish to speak with someone higher up on the food chain about turning your holdings over.\n\nWhen that day comes, the rep doesn\u2019t give you much argument about it and states that he will report this to his superiors immediately since he\u2019s sure that they will be very interested. He anticipates that you will probably get a message for a meeting time soon after he reports to them.\n\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for that meeting, you keep going back and forth on when you should tell your own people about this. You figure that you should probably at least wait until after the meeting since it doesn\u2019t do any good getting them in a tizzy if things don\u2019t work out. You anticipate that it\u2019s going to be a mixed reaction at best.\n\nStill, there is one person you tell since you figure they deserve to know.\n\n\u201cGeez, didn\u2019t expect dat.\u201d Wartz says.\n\u201cYou pissed?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cPissed?

He\u2019s as upbeat as he was the last time you met with him. He sits down and immediately orders a drink.\n\n\u201cAh here on time as always. Glad to see you continue with that habit. And I also see that you\u2019ve brought no other protection with you either for this meeting. Very interesting that you should be so trusting, but then your relationship with the Syndicate has been a cordial one so why should there be animosity?\u201d Percy says.\n\u201cI want out.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cI want out, and I\u2019m willing to give up Holgard to the Syndicate completely in order to get out.\u201d\n\nPercy sits back with a intrigued look on his face.\n\n\u201cI see. Well this is slightly different bit of business than I thought you had in mind. I thought perhaps you wanted to try to renegotiate our payment terms or perhaps ask for assistance in expanding to Klyton. A complete surrender of one\u2019s business to us without any force or influence at all is extremely rare. May I ask, why you\u2019re doing it?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u201cIt may, because for all we know you might have some hidden agenda.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no agenda, I\u2019m just getting sick of this fucking city. I\u2019m also sick of paying off the Syndicate. Since you consider this your territory anyway, you might as well have the headache of running it, because I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in this game, you don\u2019t easily get out like you\u2019re proposing, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re leaving anyway. The Syndicate is well aware that you have part of your organization on Jicol. We thought about expanding there ourselves on occasion.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk plain then. I\u2019m handing over Holgard and ALL its holdings to you directly. That means you can take all the profits from here, influence shit how you see fit and probably do a much better job than I ever could. In exchange, you leave Jicol to the Nocturnal League.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why would we leave Jicol alone?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not a damn threat? We\u2019ve never been a threat.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the Nocturnal League by itself isn\u2019t a threat, but YOU on the other hand\u2026I dunno\u2026you have a reputation. I mean while this all looks advantageous to us, something about letting you run off to an island while you plot and scheme away from our immediate attention, well that seems fairly dangerous. Maybe you can\u2019t do anything to us now, but who can say in the years to come? It\u2019s best to keep and eye on you.\u201d\n\u201cYou greatly overestimate my ambition and motivation to take on an organization such as the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you greatly underestimate our generosity and intelligence if you believe we\u2019d just let you walk away.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re realizing this isn\u2019t going well. Percy happily takes his drink from the barmaid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re fucking with me, don\u2019t you have an usurper to sabotage?\u201d you blurt out getting frustrated.\n\u201cUsurper\u2026ohhh, you know about Peter Varsakken\u2019s plans do you? Is that the real reason why you\u2019re leaving? Well if you were concerned that he was coming here to wreck the place you need not have been. You have my assurance that Peter will fail in his invasion as usual. Business here will not be disrupted.\u201d Percy remarks.\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t really give a shit. I\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m OUT of Holgard regardless of that happening or not.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Fine. Consider this a pardon from the Syndicate. You are free to leave, but what you won\u2019t be doing is running the Nocturnal League from Jicol. As far as the Syndicate is concerned, the Nocturnal League is just a tool for us to use as we see fit. We\u2019ll get someone else to run it. Maybe your second in command will be more receptive, we were thinking about contacting her anyway. She was an ex-Claw after all.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, alright! Alright! You win, I\u2019ll stay here. If there isn\u2019t going to be an invasion I guess it won\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Percy says finishing off his drink.\n\nPercy\u2019s remark catching you off guard.\n\n\u201cNo? No what?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cNo. You won\u2019t be staying here. Clearly you\u2019re unhappy in Holgard and you\u2019re really unhappy with our business arrangement. Not really a good idea to keep someone on that\u2019s a ball of anger and frustration. So as I said, you are a free man and the world is your oyster. I\u2019d advise you not entering the Delantium Kingdom, Holgard or Jicol though as you are no longer welcome in ECS territory.\u201d Percy says.\n\nThis asshole\u2019s not even negotiating anymore.\n\n\u201cWell I guess concludes our business and it looks like I\u2019m going to be staying here a little longer to sort things out. I\u2019ll give you the day to gather your belongings and leave the city. Hmmmm, maybe I should contact that rogue Temple to Fel while I\u2019m here too. They probably should be brought back into the fold\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Percy leaves the table and doesn\u2019t pay any more attention to you. You can\u2019t believe what just happened. EVERYTHING has just been stripped away from you and worse. This isn\u2019t what you wanted and you all you can feel is that frustration and anger Percy referenced earlier.\n\nSo much so that you waste no time in standing up and pulling out your pistol with every intention of shooting Percy in the back. You know you\u2019re going to be hunted forever by the ECS after this, but you don\u2019t even care. They were imposing so much on your life anyway, you feel you have nothing to lose.\n\nYou empty your pistol into Percy\u2019s back as he\u2019s walking towards the door. The few tavern patrons run for cover and every shot hits him.\n\nOr at least they would have if it were actually him.\n\nWhatever shadow magic tricks he was using have fooled you completely as the shots pass right through the false image and into the solid oak door. You then feel two sharp blades thrust hard into your back. You crumple to the floor instantly.\n\n\u201cThank you for that. This was a much easier course of action rather than potentially having to deal with you later down the road.\u201d\n\nPercy crouches down next to you as you attempt to crawl away.\n\n\u201cNot the most noble of ends, but still better than most in our line of work. And if it\u2019s any consolation, Sydicate leadership was thinking about having you done away with eventually anyway. Honestly, they should have done it a long time ago, but\u2026well I\u2019m but a servant to a greater purpose.\u201d\n\nWith those last words, Percy grabs you by the hair to lift your head up and slits your throat.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay in Holgard", "result": "As much as your current situation isn\u2019t exactly the most ideal, you\u2019re not really ready to just cut and run just yet. Not to mention you doubt if the Syndicate is going to just let you walk away even if you offered them Holgard. It\u2019s like they say, you can\u2019t just walk away from this life unless you\u2019re planning on going into hiding in a far away land.\n\nIn any case, Peter\u2019s invasion is probably going to be sabotaged again by the Syndicate since they\u2019re going to want to protect their business here.\n\n\u201cVera, thanks for the information and I\u2019ll take steps to prepare just in case, but I\u2019m not just abandoning Holgard unless it\u2019s really hopeless.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) I figured you\u2019d say that. Well I don\u2019t suppose there is much more I can convince you then since you seem to be immune to my other charms. Um\u2026 sorry about touching your hand like that, I sometimes forget our boundaries. I just\u2026worry sometimes.\u201d Vera remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Anyway, looks like I\u2019ll need to get some more hobs on the payroll.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t seriously be considering hiring more hobs.\u201d\n\u201cWell if an invasion does occur then they\u2019re going to be my best personal defense. You wouldn\u2019t happen to know how long before Peter gets his shit together do you?\u201d\n\u201cThe rumor is at least by next year.\u201d\n\u201cOkay should be plenty of time to prepare. Guess that\u2019s it then.\u201d\n\u201cGuess so.\n\u201cYou going to leave with your pirate boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cWho Zamed? He\u2019s not my boyfriend, he was just a convenient dick. He\u2019s on his way to meet with Peter anyway so I\u2019m leaving on another ship in a few days. Tried to convince me to do so as well, but I saw no reason for that and even if I did I\u2019d at least bring it to your attention first. I suppose you might be right about all this possibly not even panning out anyway. I probably could even help on that front by convincing some of the pirates I do business with to not join Zamed\u2019s flotilla.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nYou and Vera talk a bit more about less important matters before you eventually part ways due to having business to take care of. You see Vera one more time before she leaves where upon she says that she tells you to be careful and hugs you goodbye.\n\nA few months pass and besides hiring more hobs, it\u2019s pretty much business as usual. About a week after the latest visit by the Syndicate rep to pick up their cut, you get a surprising request from the Temple of Fel to meet with you. Apparently Dusk wants to speak about re-establishing an alliance.\n\nSince it seems like a good time to boost your ranks you agree to meet though you do it on your own territory since you\u2019re not fool enough to meet with a shadow priest with no back up.\n\nHonestly, you don\u2019t know much about Dusk other than he\u2019s significantly younger than both of his predecessors that took power. When he arrives you intend on expanding your knowledge on him and what his temple has been up to lately.\n\nAs it turns out, not much. He states that he thought inward reflection might help them find greater meaning of Fel\u2019s plan, which in turn made him realize that without allies the Temple is doomed to die a slow lingering death.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you say that? It isn\u2019t like there are anymore religious factions in this city anymore.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cTrue, but it isn\u2019t like there are flocks of people stepping up to join us either. Religion, perhaps even the gods themselves have seemingly abandoned this city. I suppose with all the strife I can\u2019t really blame them either. I try to keep the faith, but it\u2019s getting harder every day.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m getting at is that while what remains of our temple may still hold Fel\u2019s dark wisdom, the truth is, we cannot possibly continue as a congregation here. Our temple has started to fall into decay. The baroness who once was a dabbler in our faith has even abandoned us. We got a message not too long ago about a new law taxing religious organizations, which we can\u2019t pay of course. Of course if we don\u2019t, the government is going to just demolish our temple to build a new inn there or something.\u201d\n\u201cWait, are you asking the Nocturnal League for a loan?\u201d\n\nDusk\u2019s face turns to one of embarrassment.\n\n\u201cSad to say, but in a sense yes. Honestly, we\u2019re asking for a little more than that. We want you to take over our temple\u2019s taxes just so we still have a roof over our heads. The temple has been our home for quite awhile along with having special meaning spiritually for the remainder of us, so we are very reluctant to leave it. In exchange, we will act as soldiers for the Nocturnal League. Whatever you need done, we\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m sure you could use our talents in your line of work. If you wish, we will even teach shadow magic to those willing to learn and have the talent.\n\nWell this is a little different than you were expecting. You thought this was going to be a negotiation, not begging for a hand out. The temple of Fel really has fallen on hard times if they\u2019ve been reduced to this state.\n\nWhile the whole point of being a criminal is to not pay taxes to begin with, you do see the potential here. It really couldn\u2019t hurt to have some shadow priests indebted to you especially if Peter invades.\n\nPlus that temple could very well be used for other things.\n\nYou ask how much the taxes are which Dusk tells you and you find a little on the high side, but you\u2019re able to do it. You actually give them the stipulation that you\u2019re turning the temple into a new brothel (though they will still have their own living quarters) and you don\u2019t want them preaching about Fel to any League members. You still don\u2019t want your organization being mixed too much with religious fanaticism.\n\nDusk doesn\u2019t even blink at your request, he just agrees. Truly a beaten man from a beaten organization.\n\nIn any case at least this gives you a bit of magic leverage if trouble comes your way in whatever form.\n\nYear 33\n\nPeter Varsakken\u2019s invasion has been going on for a few weeks now, and so far the he\u2019s succeeded in is destroying Ludmilla\u2019s fleet and Holgard\u2019s docks.\n\nThe one time you want the Ebony Claw to be effective, they slack off. So much for protecting their own interests.\n\nStill, on the plus side, Peter\u2019s failed miserably on getting much further mainly because he doesn\u2019t have enough men to hold this place. Most of his mercenaries have been killed and while he does have two wizards to help him, they are literally the only thing that\u2019s keeping him in the fight.\n\nLudmilla\u2019s palace might as well be impregnable. She\u2019s using her own elite troops and magic to protect it, which is probably a mix of shadow and whatever she managed to learn from the Dornans before they got wiped out.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019ve mostly managed to keep away from the majority of the fighting. You\u2019ve only taken a bit of collateral damage from a couple of your businesses getting destroyed, but that was to be expected. All in all, you\u2019ve been doing okay.\n\nSince it\u2019s in your interest to not have Peter win, you\u2019ve ordered Dusk and his friends to take out Peter\u2019s wizards. With them out of the way things can go back to normal or as normal as they get here.\n\nIn the meantime you mostly wait around in your headquarters getting reports from people while the chaos goes on above. Warts surprisingly has stuck by your side rather than running off though he says he was sorely tempted. Things just aren\u2019t quite grim enough for him to do it yet though.\n\n\u201cHey boss, dat Dusky shadow iz at the door sayin he\u2019s got important news about the task you sent him on.\u201d Warts says.\n\u201cYeah, I sent him and his people to kill Peter\u2019s wizards. Did he do it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, but he\u2019s the only one standing outside in da sewers and he looks half dead.\u201d\n\u201cShit, that doesn\u2019t sound good. Well send him in here, maybe he killed at least one of them.\u201d\n\nEventually Warts returns with Dusk who indeed looks very battle worn. The robe he wears is in tatters making him look more like a begger and his skin that\u2019s exposed is obviously burned. His face even has several fresh wounds on it.\n\n\u201cShit, Warts wasn\u2019t lying, you do look half dead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBetter half than all.\u201d Dusk replies while wincing a bit from his pain.\n\u201cThe other Felians?\u201d\n\u201cYes, dead. All of them. I\u2019m the only one who survived. I can only hope my lost brothers and sisters are with Fel now.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, did you at least kill one of the bastards?\u201d\n\u201cKilled both of them. They are no longer an issue. I anticipate that Peter will have no choice but to abandon his invasion now.\u201d\n\nA weight is lifted when you hear this news. You were expecting Dusk to tell you something bad, so you have to ask again.\n\n\u201cWait, so you were successful? You killed them both?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t.\u201d Dusk says.\n\u201cHell yeah! This is fucking great! Warts, take the rest of the hobs here go on a street cleaning mission. There probably shouldn\u2019t be too many of Peter\u2019s men at this point, but the quicker these shitheads are gone, the better. Also make the rounds at all of our businesses too.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to take even them?\u201d Warts asks pointing at your hob bodyguards.\n\u201cYeah, I want to speak with Dusk privately anyway.\u201d\n\nWarts shrugs and waves the two hobs standing nearby to come with him leaving you and Dusk alone.\n\n\u201cYou need medical attention or something? I thin we\u2019ve got someone with some minor skills in that field around here.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good really. Shit\u2026I just need to rest for awhile. Gather my strength again.\u201d Dusk replies.\n\u201cSure. Sure. Take your time. You certainly earned it. Why don\u2019t you tell me what happened, I\u2019m sure it was a difficult battle.\u201d\n\nDusk with some effort tells you about his conflict with both of the wizards. The way he tells it is actually pretty impressive. You doubt if you could have faced two wizards like that.\n\nAs he gets towards the end of his tale he starts to sound a little better.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one hell of a tale Dusk.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not even over yet.\u201d Dusk says.\n\u201cYeah, but it soon will be. Like you said, Peter will probably realize he can\u2019t hold this place.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was talking about.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you mean then?\u201d\n\nDusk puts one finger to his lips and says \u201cShhhhh\u201d\n\nAt this point the candle light in your office goes out, immediately causing you to yell out, but no sound is made and instead you feel a blade going into you several times before you can even draw your weapon.\n\nAs you collapse on the floor, wheezing and coughing up blood, Dusk\u2019s whispering voice can be heard.\n\n\u201cFel will now forgive the transgressions of my temple for breaking away from the true faith and embrace me as a proper member of the fold. Fel will become a power once again in this city.\u201d\n\nYou feel one more sharp stab into your body before footsteps run off and out your office door.

The area of the temple is fairly quiet compared to other parts of the city. Perhaps even the average rebel knows better than to fuck around it. Which makes you question your own sanity of why you\u2019ve insisted on coming here.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t make this trip for nothing, so you take a deep breath and head up the steps to the door and then suddenly your arms are grabbed by two Felians who suddenly appear.\n\nYour first instinct is to fight, but you resist the urge to struggle.

Why in Fel\u2019s name would we let you do that? You might be ECS, but you aren\u2019t even one of the faithful! I can tell!

On one hand you can\u2019t be too surprised, but on the other now it seems like a less favorable choice. Instead of having the boss angry at you, you\u2019ll have the rest of the damn organization angry at you. You can\u2019t fucking win, maybe you need to just get the hell out of the city altogether. That would certainly solve a lot of problems.\n\nIn the mean time, you might as well find a new place to stay while you figure things out.

The regular jewelry is going to bring a nice price of course, but that crown isn\u2019t like something you\u2019ve ever stolen before.\n\nYou remove the glass and grab the crown. No sooner have you picked it up and that\u2019s when you feel an unnatural chill in the air and you\u2019re struck by a powerful vision.\n\nYou see a sprawling city though it\u2019s much larger than any sort of city you\u2019ve ever been to (granted you\u2019ve only been to Holgard, but you can tell it\u2019s much bigger than that).

DISCARD ME NOW OR FACE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR GREED!\u201d\n\nWell that command couldn\u2019t be much clearer.\n\nAs far as you know you aren\u2019t in any immediate danger, but then right now you\u2019re seeing a vision and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the \u201creal world.\u201d For all you know you could be surrounded by guards.\n\nThe \u201cvoice\u201d you\u2019re hearing could even be some sort of protection to scare rogues such as yourself into dropping the crown.\n\nYou\u2019re either going to have to mentally break the illusion you\u2019re experiencing or drop the crown and give up on this prize.", "action_results": [{"action": "Drop the crown", "result": "There is some strange magic at work here and it\u2019s obviously best if you didn\u2019t fuck around with it.

You\u2019re in a lot of pain right now, and it\u2019s at this moment that you realize you can\u2019t understand what any of these gawkers are saying to each other or you. Some of the words sound similar to ones you know, but it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re all speaking a different language.\n\nYou at first wonder if you hit the ground so hard that it damaged your head so you can\u2019t understand what people are saying anymore, but given where you are and how everyone is dressed, you\u2019ve got a bad feeling that you\u2019re a LONG way from Holgard anymore.\n\nAnd for all you know this could still all be some elaborate illusion.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re drawing a crowd and you\u2019ve had enough experience to know that\u2019s never a good thing. You quickly make your escape away from the crowd, especially when you hear more shouting coming towards your position.\n\nYou don\u2019t know where the hell you are, but you\u2019re guessing it must be a park of some sort inside the city. You need to find a secluded place and get your bearings.\n\nAs you move as quickly as you can with a twisted ankle and sore feet, you spy out the corner of your eye, the crown laying in the grass by some bushes. Seeing as this is what got you into this in the first place, you figure you might as well retrieve it.\n\nNo sooner have you picked it up again, you hear the voice again.\n\n\u201cSTILL ALIVE THIEF?

You also heard \u201cemperor\u201d which is very bad since as far as you can figure, the crown belongs to the emperor of Galpatis Empire.\n\nWhile you expect to be killed right there in the streets, the soldiers eventually stop beating you and take you away in chains.

Still, you hope she\u2019s doing a lot better than you currently are.\n\nEventually your day arrives and predictably your case is pretty cut and dry.

Right now you can see that you\u2019re going to have to steal to survive. Possibly even the basics like new clothes because you are really sticking out with what you\u2019re currently wearing.\n\nOnce you get that down, then maybe you can figure out a way to get back to your own time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 21\n\n\u201cOh come on Saldinius you can\u2019t do better than that?\u201d you say.\n\u201cSorry, but times are hard right now, that\u2019s the best I can offer!\u201d Saldinius replies making a shrugging motion.\n\u201cBah, fine. You\u2019re lucky I got more important shit to do.\u201d\n\nYou take your coin from Saldinius and make your way back to your humble room back at an inn. (Some things never change)\n\nThe Galpatis Empire might be going through a \u201cGolden Age\u201d but from what you can tell life is pretty much the same here as it was in your time. The poor bastards are struggling to survive, the rich bastards are sitting on their fat asses reaping all the benefits and everyone in between is just trying to make their own way to be a rich bastard and avoid becoming one of the poor bastards.\n\nStill, you suppose you could have wound up in a worse city when you got stuck here. Galapolis is the shining jewel and seat of the Empire and it\u2019s easily five times the size of Holgard ever was. There is no shortage of opportunity for a rogue like yourself here. Crime doesn\u2019t change too much after all and if anything you\u2019re probably a little more skilled at it than most.\n\nThat first year was really hard though. You sometimes didn\u2019t know if you were going to make it or not. It wasn\u2019t really the survival aspect, but more the mental aspect. True you didn\u2019t exactly have a \u201cgood life\u201d in your own time, but you still had ties.\n\nMany nights you thought about your family and how you\u2019d possibly never see them again. You even cried on more than one occasion. Maybe you left on bad terms, but probably in the back of you mind somewhere you thought that maybe you\u2019d reconcile somehow with your mom and dad.\n\nOf course there was your sister as well, though you probably thought about her more since you used some of the knowledge from her stories to help you through this.\n\nYou found the inner strength to carry on by learning the language, the surroundings and everything else you could. It\u2019s quite the accomplishment really. Unfortunately the only thing you haven\u2019t learned is how to get back home.\n\nYou haven\u2019t lost hope on that dream though. Magic seems to be more common, or rather more impressive from what you\u2019ve seen of it. The city of Galpatolis is protected by a giant invisible shield for example and when a dragon attacked (You nearly shit your pants when you saw one of those for the first time especially since it was much larger than the stories you heard) the beast couldn\u2019t even penetrate the defenses and its breath attack was reflected back. Eventually it was brought down by more magical defenses that disintegrated it completely.\n\nIf the magic here has that power, then surely there might be a way back home with it. The main problem is magic seems to be highly restricted to the upper class. Like nobles and such. It isn\u2019t even like you\u2019ve ever found any practicing hedge wizards or witches. Those types apparently get rounded up fairly quickly or they probably live far away from the Empire, which is pretty damn large. (As far as you can tell you\u2019re currently located where the Delantium Kingdom would be located and Galpatis Empire stretches much more than that.)\n\nThere doesn\u2019t even seem to be any \u201cdivine magic\u201d either or religion as you know it anyway. The citizens of the Empire all seem to worship the current Emperor as a \u201cliving god.\u201d (The body just being a vessel for him until he discards it for a new one)\n\nDeities in any other sense seem to be fringe beliefs at best or considered to be reserved for uncivilized barbarians that live outside the empire.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019ve asked around and done as much research as you can on the matter and there is one place in the Empire which has slightly more relaxed rules on magic and that\u2019s the town of Arcanius. Though it\u2019s not so much of a town as it is a giant magic testing area. There is where all the less disciplined, unwanted bastard children of nobles who have minor abilities or just downright anti-social wizards go to practice their skills without as much supervision though apparently there is still a powerful warden that oversees everything.\n\nThe funny thing is, it isn\u2019t restricted to go there, but there is little reason for the average non-magical person to do so. For one thing it\u2019s a very long journey and not in the most hospitable place of the Empire (Close to the Cloudpeake Mountains) Second, it isn\u2019t like the average Empire citizen wants to hang around a bunch of unhinged miscreant magic types. Though for you, it\u2019s probably your only possible chance at getting back home.\n\nIn any event, you\u2019ve raised enough coin and made the right shady connections to gain rare passage there. The use of carriages is a lot more exclusive during this time, let alone using them to travel to another city. However seeing as you\u2019re heading to a town not many want to go to anyway, your obvious lack of nobility isn\u2019t as much of an issue. Indeed you\u2019ll probably be assumed to be another bastard.\n\nThe ride leaves tomorrow and you need to be on it so you need to get your rest. You spend the rest of the day and night packing everything you plan on taking, because if all goes to plan, you won\u2019t be coming back.\n\nYou head to where the carriages are getting ready to leave and with a few extra bribes, bullshit explanations, and general apathy of the soldiers, you\u2019re waved into one of the carriages heading to Arcanius.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a several day journey from what you know so you\u2019re glad when you find that you have a carriage all to yourself. You\u2019ll be able to stretch out.\n\nEventually there is some shouting heard outside, along with the crack of several whips. Before you know it you\u2019re on your way.\n\nYou never were much of a reader before, but seeing how long this trip is going to be, you figured it would be a good idea to take some literature with you along the way. If you do manage to get back, you might even be able to sell this stuff for a hefty profit. Galpatis items would no doubt go for a lot. (And you\u2019ve collected a few other small items with this in mind)\n\nAs you spend a few days reading some books (and improve your basic understanding of the Empire\u2019s language in general) your thoughts start to wander a bit.\n\nWhat if you\u2019ve changed the future just by being here?\n\nYou\u2019ve never pondered this before, but maybe it\u2019s due to reading too much philosophy during the trip, but what if you\u2019ve changed things?\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019ve changed that much since you\u2019ve surprisingly haven\u2019t even killed anyone since being here. You\u2019ve stolen a lot of things, but is any of that really going to make a difference in the long run?\n\nYou don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat if you go back and there is nothing to go back to? Or more specifically what if you made changes here to the point that you don\u2019t exist?\n\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d You mutter as you ponder this new possibility.\n\nAt first you were concerned that you might not be able to get back home. Now you\u2019re concerned that maybe you shouldn\u2019t go back home!\n\nYou go back and forth on this many times.\n\nStaying here has always been something you thought might be inevitable anyway so would it really matter?\n\nYou get the impression that if you stayed here, you could probably carve out a future for yourself. You think with time and effort you could rise to be greater than your current status in the criminal world. Hell, you probably could get your own organization started.\n\nFor all you know you\u2019re the founder of the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\n\nNow you start to wonder if you were MEANT to be here.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell am I thinking? I need to go back! I can\u2019t fucking stay here\u2026can I?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nIn any case your struggles with metaphysical matters soon turn into very real struggles because your carriage (along with the rest) are suddenly attacked!\n\nYou hear shouting and the galloping of several horses. A look outside your window and you see a bunch of figures on horseback armed with spear type weapons and bows. At this range you think they might be green skinned. Probably orcs given the noises they\u2019re making.\n\nSo much for Empire territory being safe everywhere. Granted you are currently closer to one of its borders, but you\u2019d think that would just mean they\u2019d protect it a hell of a lot better.\n\nThe carriage you\u2019re currently on goes faster, but it\u2019s obvious that the orc raiders are going to attempt to cut everyone off assuming they don\u2019t kill everyone with arrows first.\n\nSeveral of said arrows go into your carriage and you try to get as flat as possible. You really wish you still had your pistol. You\u2019d at least be able to fire back.\n\n\u201cTHEY\u2019RE GOING TO CATCH UP TO US! EVERYONE TO ARMS!\u201d you hear someone shout and the carriage comes to a halt.\n\nLast time you looked, there was a hell of a lot of orcs. Granted you have some of the Empire\u2019s soldiers with you and hopefully a few of the bastard passengers in the other carriages are above average with their lack of formal magic training, but it\u2019s not going to be an easy fight.\n\nYou almost wonder if you should just run for your life. As strange as it is, you haven\u2019t been in a real life or death fight in years since you\u2019ve been here. You\u2019re probably a little rusty. There\u2019s also the fact that most of the people you ever fought with were other humans. Orcs are a whole different story. Especially this blood thirsty looking lot.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help fight off the orcs", "result": "You need to get to Arcanius.

On top of being on horseback, the orcs are armed with bows, spears and javelins. You aren\u2019t some heavily armored soldier and you don\u2019t have magic powers to fire back. If you still had your pistol this might not be as big of a deal since you could easily fire back at them. Since you don\u2019t have any of those things, you figure you\u2019ll continue to hide in the carriage until you see a suitable opening to attack.\n\nYou remain low to the floor in the carriage, occasionally looking out the window. You mostly the orcs circling about on horseback and using their bows to their advantage, though a couple of the novice mages are breaking up that advantage by slinging a few magic missile spells while hiding behind the shield wall that the soldiers have created.\n\nFor a while it looks like you might survive all this and not even have to fight after all.\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s when the leader shows up. He\u2019s not riding a horse either, but a chariot pulled by what looks like giant armored boars. Several of his people rally in front of him and they all make a beeline charge towards the soldiers, while others ride around to flank the sides.\n\nTo their credit, the soldiers hold the wall and a few of the mages don\u2019t even run and instead try to take out the main force approaching, but ultimately the orcs have more numbers and the leader is tough.\n\nHis chariot crashes spectacularly into the shield wall, breaking through and trampling several of the soldiers. The boars and chariot aren\u2019t in the best of shape either of course, but that doesn\u2019t matter since the leader has already jumped off it and begin chopping people up directly with a huge axe.\n\n\u201cShit. Should have left when I had the chance.\u201d You say and leave the carriage as quick as you can.\n\nRealizing that this is a lost battle, you quickly start trying to free one of the living horses still attached to one of the carriages (and desperately trying to get free of the chaos by trying to drag the carriage despite the fact that it\u2019s dead fellows along side it are preventing such a thing)\n\nOf course while you\u2019re trying to do this one of the mounted orcs appears and gallops straight towards you. You try to get back in the carriage to avoid being trampled or cut down, but instead the orc grabs the last javelin on his back and throws it at you.\n\nPredictably he\u2019s a good shot and you\u2019re impaled through the back and out your chest. Your death is instantaneous.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run", "result": "Remembering when your other carriage ride was attacked by bandits, you didn\u2019t stick around and fight them, you took off and ran and it worked out (more or less). Seems like the same strategy should apply here.\n\nYou get out of the carriage and start unhooking one of the horses tied to your carriage. The driver who is still nearby sees what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cHey! What the hell are you doing? You need to start slinging spells at those orcs!\u201d the driver shouts.\n\u201cYeah, well that won\u2019t be happening.\u201d You say.\n\nThe driver at this point grabs your arm.\n\n\u201cAnd why the fuck not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not a fucking wizard asshole!\u201d you reply and then slug the driver in face.\n\nHe falls to the ground and you successfully get the horse free. You\u2019re about to mount it when the driver once again attempts to stop you.\n\n\u201cCowardly sonof\u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all he gets out before you shove a dagger in his throat and kick him to the ground again. You don\u2019t bother to retrieve the dagger as you see orcs quickly swaming the area, you just get on the horse and gallop away.\n\nYour next plan is to follow the road and hopefully you\u2019ll eventually reach your destination. It\u2019s not ideal and you\u2019re still not exactly sure of the directions, but you\u2019re hoping you can figure it out as you go or hope that the Empire at least has signs on their more isolated roads even if they apparently don\u2019t have proper security on them.\n\nYou haven\u2019t gotten far when a javelin whizzes past you. You look behind and see two orcs in pursuit. You can\u2019t really do much except duck as low as you can and try to outpace them.\n\nYou see a bridge in the distance and head towards it. You feel something hit your back, or rather your backpack. Fortunate that you were wearing it to block the arrow.\n\nOne of the orcs has dispensed with ranged attacks and is concentrating on closing the gap. When you get to the bridge, he\u2019s almost on you and swinging a morning star.\n\nYou draw your sword and try to swing it at the orc. Unfortunately the orc\u2019s morning star partially wraps around it. Between riding and awkwardly trying to fight, you don\u2019t have enough grip to pull the sword back, especially since the orc is much stronger and pulling his own weapon back as well.\n\nSo you do the only logical thing and let go of the sword causing the orc to pull too much on his end, lose his balance; fall off his horse and over the side of bridge.\n\nYou don\u2019t have too much time to celebrate however since the other orc hasn\u2019t given up on ranged attacks and throws his last javelin at you. On the plus side it doesn\u2019t hit you. The bad news is it hits the horse causing it to flail and causing you to also lose balance and go over the side of the bridge!\n\nThe water isn\u2019t excessively deep, but the current in the river is strong that it instantly starts carrying your away. You no idea where the hell it\u2019s taking you, but your main concern is trying not to drown.\n\nYou tread water for a while in your attempt to get to shore despite the strong current. Eventually you manage to grab on to a fallen tree trunk and drag yourself to shore.\n\nYou\u2019re soaked, you\u2019re cold, and you\u2019re exhausted. You lost your pack during your time in the river and you have no idea where you are now, but you\u2019re too tired to care. You lie motionless on the muddy bank you\u2019re on for a moment just trying to gather yourself, but as they say, no rest for the wicked.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you shout just barely rolling out of the way of the large branch wielded by the orc who also fell off the bridge. You don\u2019t know where he came from and you didn\u2019t even hear him, but none of that matters right now. What matters is how you\u2019re going to survive his assault.\n\nMiraculously, despite losing nearly all your other possessions in the river, you still have one extra dagger on your person. You draw it, but you don\u2019t have a positive feeling about your chances.\n\nAs tired as you are, the orc is fairly clumsy about swinging his branch at you so you manage to dodge. Obviously more used to fighting on horseback.\n\nStill, the orc has a lot more endurance than you do and eventually he catches you with a glancing blow upside your head. You fall to the ground, dazed. Expecting the next hit to crush your skull, you hear the orc make a more anguished cry.\n\nYou look and see a woman dressed in fur clothing with a bow and she\u2019s currently getting another arrow ready now that the orc\u2019s attention is directed towards her and didn\u2019t go down from the first shot.\n\nShe hits it again, but it keeps coming. Now she begins to panic, but still attempts to get off another shot. She misses though.\n\nMeanwhile, you\u2019ve managed to recover a bit, and once again you can take the opportunity to run while the orc\u2019s attention is divided.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run", "result": "Having no pride and a strong sense of self-preservation, you muster up all your remaining energy and run in the opposite direction of the orc and woman.\n\nYou run a good distance through some trees, but you soon find yourself very winded and you have to stop.

You\u2019re not even by the river anymore and you\u2019re reluctant to retrace your steps lest you run into your greenskin friend again.\n\n\nYou rest a moment and figure afterwards you\u2019ll get your bearings though you\u2019re now so drained that the moment you lay up against a tree and close your eyes, you fall asleep.\n\nWhen you wake up, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re still in pain, along with being cold, the only good thing is you think you must have lost the orc since you doubt if you have reawakened at all\n\nSince attempting to travel in this darkness would be foolish in your condition, you don\u2019t try. You just continue to try to get some more rest and hope you can find your way back to some sort of civilization at this point because you still really hate the wilderness.\n\nYou close your eyes again and manage to get back to sleep.\n\nAt some point you wake up again. This time you couldn\u2019t have been asleep too long since it\u2019s still dark. However that\u2019s not the important part.

You stab it in the back multiple times and don\u2019t stop until the woman calls out to you.\n\n\u201cOkay. I think you killed it.\u201d She shouts.\n\nYou snap out of your killing trance for a moment and see you\u2019ve made quite the mess. You stand up breathing heavily.\n\n\u201cFucking greenskins.\u201d You exclaim, kicking the dead body.\n\u201cI hope this isn\u2019t a possible invasion. We saw another one a few months ago, though he was much smaller and ran off when he saw us. He was nowhere near as big as this one.\u201d The woman remarks.\n\u201cFortunately for you that you weren\u2019t where I just was, because there was a bunch of orcs that size on horseback about to destroy the Caravan I was part of.\u201d\n\nThe woman shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI thought the empire was supposed to be making the land safe. So much for their promises, well anyway, thanks for saving my life. I froze up a bit when that orc didn\u2019t go down with the second arrow.\u201d The woman says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, but I\u2019d say you saved mine first seeing as that orc would have caved my skull in if you hadn\u2019t shown up.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cHm, I suppose that\u2019s true enough. Guess we helped each other. So where was this Caravan and where were you going?\u201d\n\u201cShit, I don\u2019t even know now. I know I was probably north east of here. There was a stone bridge and then I fell into the river and wound up here. I was travelling from Galpatolis and going to Arcanius.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes widen when you say that.\n\n\u201cI see. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI got business there. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could tell me how I could get there from here.\u201d You say walking towards her, but then you experience a moment of fatigue and your legs give out causing you to partially collapse to the ground. The woman goes to help you up.\n\n\u201cHey, you still don\u2019t look that great. Look, you\u2019re barely in any condition to walk anywhere let along travelling all the way to Arcanius. Why don\u2019t you come back with me where you can at least rest and heal up? I mean as I said, you did help me kill the orc. My village isn\u2019t that far away.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, yeah that sounds fine.\u201d You say not really wishing to argue since she\u2019s right about you not being in the best condition right now.\n\nThe woman tells you her name is Keira and her village is Tarvo. She goes on about how it was absorbed by the Empire decades ago and how they used to even have a sizable amount of soldiers there, but eventually they realized the village was never going to be a problem as far as rebellions go. As it stands there are only a few soldiers and a single Galpatis official who probably got sent there because he pissed someone off. As a result he doesn\u2019t really enforce many official Galpatian laws other than something obvious like murder or rape and allows everyone to go about their normal lives.\n\nEventually you get to the village, which is fairly humble. It\u2019s probably smaller than your old home of Teckleville.\n\n\u201cHey Keira, you catch that hunting this time?\u201d some other woman asks and points at you.\n\u201cSort of. He was fighting an orc and we both brought it down together.\u201d Keira replies.\n\u201cAn orc? This close to the village?! Shit. We need to tell the magistrate about that! Not that I really want soldiers stomping about here, but if orcs are going to be a problem then I\u2019d rather we have better defenses then we have!\u201d\n\u201cMm. Well, I need to get back to my home and patch him up.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t Ardan see you taking another man inside your home! He might get the wrong idea!\u201d\n\nKeira makes a minor laugh and waves at the woman, though you notice Keira also rolling her eyes when she turns her head away.\n\nYou soon get to Keira\u2019s home which isn\u2019t large, but you suppose it\u2019s big enough to serve Keira\u2019s needs since she\u2019s living here alone. She gets a fire started and you welcome the warmth since you\u2019ve been near freezing since you got out of the water.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019ll get warmer quicker if you get your clothes off. Those are going to need to dry properly anyway.\u201d Keira says.\n\u201cUm what?\u201d a little taken by surprise.\n\u201cWhat? Is what you got under those clothes so impressive that you think I just won\u2019t be able to contain myself? Or perhaps you\u2019re just shy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, after the day I had, I really wasn\u2019t expecting it to end with a pretty woman asking me to take my clothes off. I\u2019m half expecting you to turn into a monster of some sort which would be more in line with my luck lately.\u201d\n\nKeira chuckles a bit.\n\n\u201cWell that won\u2019t happen, so perhaps your luck is better than you think. Perhaps even Yaz is looking over you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you say Yag?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I said Yaz. You know, the god of fortune? I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s worshipped in Galpatolis.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but he\u2019s called Yag where I come from.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Interesting. I suppose divine beings go by many names though. Glad to know you weren\u2019t one of those silly people that worships the emperor though I didn\u2019t think you were really from Galpatolis since you don\u2019t look like you are.\u201d\n\u201cYou could tell just by looking at me?\u201d\n\u201cI could tell just by how you speak and act. You speak the language like you only just learned it. You\u2019re obviously not a native Galpatian. Where are you from originally?\u201d\n\u201cEh, I\u2019m originally from a small village far to the south. It\u2019s so small, nobody really knows it exists.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I guess the Empire came and annexed your people too huh?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that\u2026ouch!\u201d you say feeling the aches and pains in your body.\n\u201cOkay, I think it\u2019s time you took your clothes off, you probably got some wounds that need patching up and I can get to them better if you\u2019re naked.\u201d\n\u201cI gotta say, this is still pretty unusual for me. That other woman mentioned someone called Ardan, I mean I don\u2019t want your husband\u2026\u201d\n\u201cArdan is NOT my husband.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well boyfriend then.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s barely that, and if he does come in here, he can just step right back out, because he pissed me off recently anyway. I don\u2019t want to talk about that though. Besides, nothing is happening between us anyway. I don\u2019t just become involved with strange men I find in the wilderness, so let\u2019s get you fixed up.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then if you insist.\u201d\n\nYou still feel a bit weird about all this, but honestly with as much pain you\u2019re in right now, you really aren\u2019t thinking about Keira in that way. (Well at least not immediately)\n\nEventually Keira stitches up some of your wounds and places some sort of healing salve on them. She then gives you some spare furs to wrap yourself up in while your clothing dries. She tells you that you can stay here for a few days so you can heal up. As much as you\u2019re in a hurry to get to Arcanius, it probably would be best if you rested.\n\nAs the days pass Keira says with you here, she\u2019s probably spent more time in her home than she has since her mother died since she had to be around more to take care of her.\n\nApparently Keira prefers being outdoors hunting even when she doesn\u2019t need to, even sleeping outside under the stars at times rather than coming home. She says that sometimes she\u2019d like to travel, but she says she\u2019s never quite had the nerve to do it. She\u2019s not sure why exactly seeing as there isn\u2019t much to tie her here except Ardan though once again she doesn\u2019t speak much more about him.\n\nKeira asks you a few questions about yourself, which you keep vague with half truths, misdirections and outright lies. You don\u2019t want to discuss your real situation anymore than she wants to discuss Ardan.\n\nKeira also tells you how to get to Arcanius though she doesn\u2019t ask why you\u2019re going again. Going by her directions, it\u2019s going to still be a long ass trip, especially with no horse or other mode of transportation now. You don\u2019t even have any supplies for such a journey though maybe Keira will give you some before you leave.\n\nWhen you\u2019re feeling slightly better you insist on walking about the village which Keira is happy to see since she doesn\u2019t feel the need to check up on you.\n\nYou wander the village a bit and are mostly met with stares, but nothing more. A few people actually have heard about you since news spread in this village fairly quickly. It\u2019s mostly positive, since killing an orc is something to be celebrated here. In fact a few people are so nice they actually give you some free food.\n\nAs you\u2019re accepting a few of these free gifts, a couple of soldiers approach saying that you\u2019re the one they\u2019ve been hearing about and how the magistrate wants to see you about the orc found near the village since a few people have expressed concern to him about it.\n\nSeeing as you aren\u2019t really doing anything better right now and in no condition to resist. You go with the soldiers and follow to a slightly better looking building than the rest of the village.\n\nThe magistrate doesn\u2019t look like the typical noble that you\u2019ve seen many times before back in Galpatolis. He\u2019s got more facial hair and a general less kept appearance. It\u2019s apparent he barely gives a shit about formalities anymore since he gives his nose a quick pick and blows it out before even speaking to you.\n\nThe meeting isn\u2019t very long. The magistrate just asks you some general questions about yourself and how you came to be in the situation where you were fighting an orc in the first place. You give him the same story you told Keira and he seems to accept that as a suitable explanation. He doesn\u2019t even ask why you were going to Arcanius. The man just seems to be fulfilling the basics of his duties.\n\n\u201cI see. So the orc you were fighting was separated from his fellows. Which means these villagers are jumping to conclusions that there is an imminent attack from orc savages. Glad to hear it, since I doubt if those assholes in the capital would bother sending anyone up here anyway. Very well. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d The magistrate says.\n\u201cOkay. Um, is there any transportation from here to Arcanius?\u201d\n\u201cSure, put one foot in front of the other and start walking. What? Did you think we\u2019d give you a horse for killing a single orc that you apparently lead near here in the first place? I got more important matters to care of. Out.\u201d\n\nAnd with those words, the magistrate\u2019s soldiers start escorting you out the office and soon out the building as well.\n\nWell at least the law isn\u2019t trying to arrest you for a change.\n\nIn any case, you get the strong impression you\u2019ll have to steal a horse before you leave this place. Not before at least another day of rest though. You wander the village a bit more before heading back to Keira\u2019s home.\n\nWhen you arrive, she\u2019s still not back yet, though she did say now that you\u2019re feeling better, she might be gone a little longer. That\u2019s awfully trusting of her to just assume some stranger isn\u2019t going to take her stuff. You guess thieves aren\u2019t a real problem around here since everyone knows one another and she probably believes you to be an upstanding person.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much that you\u2019d want to take anyway, not to mention you\u2019d be quite the scoundrel indeed if you stole from a woman who has done nothing but help you. You aren\u2019t quite that much of an asshole.\n\nStill, doesn\u2019t prevent you from being a little nosey and you look through some of her belonging that are more out in open.\n\nAs you\u2019re picking up what looks to be a flute sitting on a small table by her bed, you hear footsteps behind you.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the guy that killed an orc and has been living here with Keira? You are far less impressive than I heard about.\u201d A voice says.\n\nYou turn around and see a large older man standing in the entryway with a small axe in his hand. You just can\u2019t catch a break.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re Ardan I presume. Surprised I haven\u2019t seen you sooner.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI was out hunting and I come back after a few days only to find that another man is trying to steal MY woman!\u201d Ardan exclaims.\n\u201cOkay look, I\u2019m not stealing your woman. She\u2019s just letting me stay here until I recover. In fact I should be leaving by tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cOh so you think you can just fuck my woman and leave then?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t fucked her! In fact NOTHING has happened between us!\u201d\n\u201cOh we\u2019re going to see about that. Come on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome on. We\u2019re going to both go see Keira. I know her better than anyone and I\u2019ll know if she\u2019s lying or not when I confront her with you there.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s out hunting.\u201d\n\u201cSo? I know what grounds she prefers and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. Now you\u2019re coming with me or I\u2019m going to break your legs and drag you out of here.\u201d\n\nArdan grips his axe tightly after threatening you.\n\nWell he\u2019s no orc, but you doubt if he\u2019d be an easy fight either. The guy is predictably crazy jealous and you suppose to can understand his view point, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that for all you know he\u2019s going to just take you out to a more secluded place and murder you there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Ardan", "result": "If Ardan has plans on killing you, he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be averse to doing it right here if need be. If you need to run, better that you\u2019re not in an enclosed space to more easily get away.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming with you. I really don\u2019t want any trouble. When we get to Keira, you\u2019ll see that nothing is going on.\u201d You say and raise your hands up.\n\nArdan is still giving you a look that could kill but seems to calm down enough that he opens the door to let you go through it first.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t think about trying to run, I can split a grizzly\u2019s skull with this axe from a large distance. Wouldn\u2019t take much to do the same to the likes of you.\u201d Ardan says as you pass him.\n\nThe pair of you walk out of the village and in this light and at this range, you see his face better and something about him looks very familiar.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you staring at me for?\u201d Ardan asks.\n\u201cNothing! Sheesh, I mean we are walking together and sometimes I\u2019m going to look over at you. You really need to relax, you\u2019re going to see that Keira loves you, not me.\u201d You say trying to calm him again.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me! If she did, she wouldn\u2019t make me angry all the time!\u201d\n\u201cWell what does she do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does she do? What the hell doesn\u2019t she do?! She\u2019s constantly having these ideas!\u201d\n\u201cA dangerous past time indeed.\u201d You say and fortunately Ardan doesn\u2019t realize your sarcasm and instead continues to rant.\n\n\u201cI know! She does silly things like try to play that flute thing instead of focusing on more important matters!\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cLike not wasting her time playing a flute for one thing! She\u2019s horrible at it anyway and when I helpfully point this out to save her time, she gets pissed at me!\u201d\n\u201cWow, I can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d\n\u201cAlso she wants to leave the village like there\u2019s something more out there for her! There\u2019s nothing that she needs outside the village that I can\u2019t provide! I mean\u2026\u201d\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t obvious before, it\u2019s very apparent now that this Ardan is incredibly insecure and most likely controlling. You can see why Kiera didn\u2019t want to talk about him.\n\nOddly, he\u2019s ranting about her so much now that it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s angrier at her than he is at you now. A step up you suppose, you figure maybe there might be hope to get out of this without a fight after all.\n\nAgain though, he seems familiar somehow. Even his voice is starting to remind you of someone you know.\n\n\u201cShe wants to leave me after all I\u2019ve fucking done for her! I taught her how to hunt better! I was by her side when her mother was dying! And fucking another man is how she repays me?\u201d\n\u201cArdan, I didn\u2019t have sex with Keira.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even fucking matter if you did or not. My point is, she\u2019s letting a damn stranger live with her before ME! That just shits all over our relationship as far as I\u2019m concerned! And another thing\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then it hits you. You can\u2019t even believe it. You recognize this man. Or at least you recognize his facial features and voice. The beard was throwing you before, but there can be no mistake.\n\nThis Ardan could easily pass for your dad if your dad was more muscular and taller. You\u2019ve also been yelled at your father enough that the voice is even similar. Ardan has to be an ancestor of yours! What the hell are the chances? Yag must have flipped the coin on the edge for you this time.\n\nAnd if this man is indeed some ancestor of yours that means Keira is also! (You feel a little weird being naked in front of her now) It makes sense; she has similar traits that your sister has. Hell, now that you\u2019re thinking about it, Keira does have a similar nose as her.\n\nArdan is obviously older than Keira by probably at least twenty years since she\u2019s probably about your age. You sort of wonder how this relationship even got started, but then again an older guy with a much younger woman isn\u2019t that uncommon.\n\nStill, this is all almost too much for you to comprehend. A few days ago you were pondering if you were meant to be here, well maybe THIS is the reason! Your ancestors are obviously having problems; maybe YOU need to fix them.\n\nMeanwhile Ardan is still complaining.\n\n\u201cHey! Are you listening to me? We\u2019re going this way!\u201d Ardan shouts.\n\u201cOh. Apologies. I was just thinking about your situation and I was wondering if you\u2019ve tried being more supportive of her.\u201d\n\u201cSupportive? I just told you all the shit I\u2019ve done for her!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it always seems like you\u2019re doing these things and expecting a certain consistent behavior. I mean she\u2019s a woman not a dog.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean is, it sounds like she just wants you to not yell at her so much when she wants to try something new. You telling her that she sucks at the flute might be the truth, but you could approach it a different way and not just tell her to give it up. You need to be more\u2026sensitive.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you just gave that as advice, but if that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to make sure you exist, then so be it.\n\nArdan scoffs as you continue.\n\n\u201cI mean if she wants to leave the village why not go with her? You\u2019re both hunters no? Surely between the pair of you, you would have no trouble in the foraging for food and water aspect or even overcoming dangers.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve lived here all my life and never felt the need to travel. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at and SHE needs to be happy too!\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really work that way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck would you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m an expert, but I know that talking to Keira the way you\u2019ve been telling me you\u2019ve been doing isn\u2019t going to win her over. I mean I\u2019ve spoke with her and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo what then? You telling me YOU know how to talk better to my woman than I do? Is that what you\u2019re getting at?\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe your ancestor is THIS much of a stubborn asshole. Or rather you can, but you\u2019re almost starting to feel sorry for your great grandmother many times over if this is the guy she\u2019s going to have to continue sleeping with so you eventually exist.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not understanding me.\u201d You say almost immediately realizing your poor choice of words.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m stupid as well? You know what, you\u2019ve been doing a lot of fucking talking, trying to fool me. Well I\u2019m not fooled. You\u2019ve obviously charmed Keira with your words and turned her against me!\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026how?! I only just got here! You were having problems with her long before I arrived!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well when I get rid of you that will be one less problem!\u201d\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d\n\nWith a throaty yell, Ardan attacks you with his axe. Fortunately you\u2019re a lot more agile than he is, so you manage to dodge his swings. You can\u2019t even fight back, since you doubt if you could overpower him physically and you certainly can\u2019t kill him.\n\n\u201cArdan! Listen to me! I\u2019m not your enemy!\u201d you shout, but he isn\u2019t listening.\n\nYou continue to back away and dodge, but you aren\u2019t sure how much longer you can keep this up because Ardan seems to have a lot of energy in trying to kill you.\n\n\u201cArdan! Stop\u201d you say and just barely manage to duck Ardan\u2019s axe.\n\nTaking a risk, you draw your dagger and try to stab his weapon arm so he\u2019ll at least drop it.\n\nYou succeed and he drops his axe. When you go to pick it up however, Ardan just decides to tackle you, however the pair of you are near a slope and as a result, both of you go tumbling down a steep hill.\n\nYou both roll down it gaining speed and eventually even separating from each other. You fortunately manage to grab on to some bushes growing along the slope. Ardan however keeps rolling and that\u2019s when you see that the slope doesn\u2019t stop on flat ground, but instead what looks to be a long drop over a cliff.\n\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d you say\n\nArdan just manages to stop himself from going over the side completely by grabbing the cliff edge.\n\nYou try to run down as fast as you can without tumbling again.\n\n\u201cArdan! Hold on! I\u2019m coming!\u201d you shout.\n\nYou get just in range and then that\u2019s when you see his fingers slip followed by a yell. Your heart sinks and you can only hope that the drop wasn\u2019t as far as you think.\n\nThe yell stops and you slowly look over the side.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you see Ardan\u2019s broken body on a pile of rocks. This is a complete disaster. You feel sick and you actually throw up.\n\nIf your time here hasn\u2019t changed history before, it certainly has now, because your family as you know it, is dead. You sort of expect yourself to blink out of existence, but that doesn\u2019t happen. You don\u2019t know why, but maybe it doesn\u2019t work like that because you\u2019re still in the past.\n\nBut what happens now if you return to the future? Even if the mages at Arcanius can help you, you certainly can\u2019t return to your time now.\n\nYou run through a gamut of thoughts and emotions just thinking about all this. In between the thinking you keep kicking yourself for stealing that fucking crown. It warned you and you didn\u2019t listen.\n\nYou then ponder the idea that you keep going back to, \u201cWhat if you\u2019re meant to be here?\u201d and that\u2019s when you come to a damning realization.\n\n\u201cShit. It\u2019s the only way now.\u201d You mutter to yourself and mentally prepare yourself.\n\nWhen you get back to Keira\u2019s home, you find that she\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cHey, there you are! I was thinking you left for Arcanius without saying goodbye. I mean not that you need to, but it would be the polite thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t do that. Not when you\u2019ve done so much for me. In fact I was sort of wondering if you\u2019d come with me.\u201d\n\u201cCome with you? To Arcanius?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve decided a change of plans and I\u2019m just going to head back to Galpatolis. I know how much you said you wanted to travel and see new places, so I figured I\u2019d ask if you wanted to come.\u201d\n\nKeira looks a bit surprised by all this.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Keira remarks.\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of? You obviously have a wanderlust that needs to be sated and I\u2019m willing to travel with you so you won\u2019t be alone on the journey. I mean we can go to different places if you like, but I figured we\u2019d start with Galpatolis since it\u2019s a place I know very well and there\u2019s plenty to do there. I mean you could even bring your flute if you like. I noticed one sitting on your table. Didn\u2019t even knew you played, I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing you.\u201d\n\nKeira briefly looks over at it and her eyes widen as if this encouragement is the first she\u2019s heard in awhile from anyone. You take a deep breath and approach her closer.\n\n\u201cLook, I know this is a big change, but sometimes when big changes present themselves, your best bet is to embrace them. I know I haven\u2019t known you long and maybe I\u2019m over stepping a boundary here, but I think you\u2019re meant for things outside of this simple village.\u201d\n\nKeira smiles a bit at you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute, otherwise I might not be so swayed by your charming words. However, I sense that you\u2019re being genuine with me and I think you\u2019re right anyway. I SHOULD follow my desires. I shall pack immediately!\u201d\n\nKeira suddenly kisses you on the cheek and excitedly goes to pack. Since you\u2019re a little tired from accidently killing your ancestor and all, you tell her you want to get some sleep and start the journey tomorrow. She agrees and continues to pack.\n\nThe next day, Keira wakes you up at the crack of dawn and the pair of you leave Tarvo.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still a little groggy, Keira is very talkative and still very excited about all this.\n\nYou figure with as good of terms you\u2019re on with her, by the time your reach Galpatolis the pair of you should have already consummated your relationship. A little on the optimistic side perhaps, but you really need to seal this deal because it\u2019s not really your life you\u2019re worried about anymore, it\u2019s your entire lineage.\n\nSure you feel pretty weird about the fact that you\u2019re going to be sexing up what is your distant relative, but you remind yourself, that this is the only way.\n\nPlus it doesn\u2019t hurt that she\u2019s attractive and has a pleasant personality.\n\n\u201cHey I meant to ask you before you made your suggestion last night, as I was coming home yesterday, someone told me they thought they saw you coming out of my home with Ardan earlier.\u201d Keira remarks.\n\u201cArdan? Never saw him. They must have been mistaken, though I\u2019m surprised I never saw him.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHm. Yes, it is strange. I thought he\u2019d at least show up threatening you or something similar. He was very jealous and possessive.\u201d\n\u201cWho knows. Hey, how about you play something on your flute?\u201d you say quickly changing the subject.\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not very good and I only know a few songs that my mother taught me.\u201d\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t get good unless you practice!\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. Okay! I\u2019ll play The Laughing Elf and his Talking Unicorn.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I know that one. Okay, go ahead.\u201d\n\nKeira excitedly starts to play her song.\n\nAnd she\u2019s fucking terrible. You feel like your ears are being raped. You suffer in silence as she continues to play horribly all the while thinking, she has to get better in her later years.\n\nAt least you hope she does because it\u2019s going to be a punishment if musicianship skips this generation. You also hope her poor skills on the flute don\u2019t also match other skills involving blowing.\n\n\u201cHow does it sound?\u201d Keira asks.\n\u201cLike nothing I\u2019ve ever heard before. Just keep at it.\u201d You say with a smile.\n\nWhile you\u2019re not sure if your life as a rogue is over, but it certainly has taken a very different turn.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay put", "result": "You doubt if you\u2019re going to go meet Keira and if Ardan\u2019s going to kill you, you\u2019re not going to make it easy for him by going where it\u2019s isolated.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got a better idea. Let\u2019s just wait for Keira to come back home.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, this needs to be settled now and I\u2019m not going to wait around.\u201d Ardan replies.\n\u201cWell if you think I\u2019m going into the woods with you alone, you\u2019re sadly mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have thought about that before you decided to move in on my woman.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I didn\u2019t move in on her!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re living here and you expect me to believe that?\u201d\n\u201cFuck this. Your mind is obviously made up about me, so if you\u2019re going to try to kill me, you better just try to do it now, otherwise I\u2019m going to just leave.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nArdan now moves towards you and he looks fully intent on using that axe now.\n\n\u201cWell then I guess you\u2019ve made your choice.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGuess I have.\u201d Ardan answers.\n\nYou draw your dagger and then throw a nearby cup on the small table at Ardan. He blocks his face and then swings his axe at you.\n\nIn these close quarters its difficult to avoid him, but you\u2019re still a lot more agile than him. You honestly don\u2019t intend on fighting him, your goal is to get around him and out the door so you can get outside.\n\nArdan swings a few more times and you duck and roll. You stab Ardan in the leg and while he\u2019s fallen to one knee due to that wound, you achieve your goal of getting around him and out the door.\n\nYour next move is to try to find a horse, which as far as you know the few that are in town are near the magistrate building. You run back towards that way, meanwhile Ardan has recovered from his wound and begins shouting.\n\n\u201cSTOP THAT FUCKER! HE JUST TRIED TO KILL ME!\u201d he shouts.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nHoping that nobody takes him seriously, you continue to run and then you feel a hard force hit you in the back of the head.

By the time you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ve more or less filled your pack, you\u2019re starting to think that Warts had the right idea after all, but you decide you\u2019ve pushed your luck enough and that it\u2019s time to go, even if there is a second floor to loot.\n\nAs you\u2019re making your way back down the stairs, Warts suddenly is running up them.\n\n\u201cWarts, what the hell?\u201d you ask\n\u201cUp! Go back! Up! We gotta\u2026 HRUP!\u201d\n\nWarts vomits all over your legs and boots.

In between that, the heavier pack and the vomit still covering your boots, you end up slipping and tumbling down the stairs and into the cultists.\n\nWhile the cultists cushion your fall down the stairs, it doesn\u2019t do much on improving your situation overall. There are enough of them that after the fall to the bottom, you\u2019re immediately nabbed, beaten and stripped.

They\u2019re even less pleased when they learn that you released her.\n\nYou aren\u2019t killed right away, but after a couple of weeks you wish you had.

The Holgard Watch is still patrolling the area of course, but they aren\u2019t standing guard over it like gargoyles. It\u2019s a simple matter of just waiting and sneaking over to the front door, which has a pathetically easy lock.\n\nYou walk about the dimly lit ground floor and begin looking around cautiously. It doesn\u2019t take long before you start pilfering several expensive looking items. With your pack nearly full of loot, you consider leaving, but you figure you should at least give the second floor a look seeing as you\u2019re here and you may just find something even better.\n\nYou walk upstairs and begin creeping around the landing and going in the various rooms. One thing you notice is while you were told how this place was the home of some big cultist, so far you haven\u2019t really found any evidence of anything like that.\n\nWell at least not until you find Reginald\u2019s master bedroom.\n\nIt is there that while going through a few containers, you find evidence of his religious practices namely in the form of some dark tomes. You glance through them and see a lot of writing in a language you don\u2019t understand and you start to feel a little uncomfortable. Like a chill goes up your spine.\n\n\u201cFuck this. I\u2019m not taking this shit.\u201d You mutter and quickly put the books back in the drawer.\n\nAs you\u2019re about to leave, you spot a red jeweled medallion and figure you\u2019ll nab that on your way out.\n\nUnfortunately, this was probably more dangerous than the books since those were only dangerous if you spoke the text in them. The medallion on the other hand contains powerful magic and since you don\u2019t have the right protection against it, you\u2019re fucked.\n\nThe moment you touch the medallion, you feel immediately compelled to put it on. As soon as you do so, your body is instantly paralyzed and you fall to the floor. You\u2019re still aware of your surroundings, but can\u2019t do shit about anything. You soon begin to panic and you\u2019d probably cry out if you were able.\n\nYou lay there motionless until dawn and the terror becomes worse as you hear what you guess to be Reginald coming up the stairs.

There even looks to be a sign post nearby, which makes you think that you are probably going in the right direction.\n\nUnfortunately it also looks like a group of four bandits has boldly decided to set up a blockade of sorts here. They haven\u2019t seen you yet, so that\u2019s at least one good thing in your favor. Of course while you only see four bandits, who knows if there are more hiding nearby with bows or something. In fact you probably shouldn\u2019t linger here too long. You slink away and head upstream hoping you\u2019ll find another way. (And not get too lost in the process)\n\nYou don\u2019t have too much luck for the most part, but then you see one area where the water looks low enough to cross. You decide to make the attempt.\n\nAll goes well until it turns out the water wasn\u2019t as low as you thought and you\u2019re now knee deep in it. You\u2019re already a third way across however and you press on.\n\nBy the time the water is nearly up to your chest, the current begins to pull you and you\u2019re soon not walking across the river bottom anymore. You try to maintain control of the situation, but the current is swifter than you anticipated, not to mention you don\u2019t know how to swim.\n\nYou\u2019re fortunate in that you don\u2019t get pulled too far downstream or go completely underwater before you manage to grab hold of a rock which is close enough to the other side that you pull yourself to the other side of the river bank.\n\nYour possessions are another story however. You\u2019ve lost your coin bag, along with the pistol you just managed to acquire. About the only thing you have left is your dagger. You curse your luck along with the forest, the river and your situation in general. After releasing a torrent of swearing, you move on.\n\nEventually night falls and along with now being cold and wet, you\u2019re also starting to feel tired. You aren\u2019t even sure if you\u2019re heading in the right direction anymore since you got a bit discombobulated when you were struggling not to drown.\n\nStill, you press on and that\u2019s when you think you see a slight respite in this mess.\n\nYou see a cabin, though probably an abandoned one as there is no light coming from it. You just hope there isn\u2019t anyone or anything lurking inside.\n\nYou cautiously approach the cabin and while you have a feeling of unease the entire time, when you explore around it, you don\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary. Of course it is dark, so maybe you\u2019re missing something, but so far it doesn\u2019t look like anyone is making camp here.\n\nAs soon as you try the door though all your senses start to scream danger and you draw your dagger and spin around. You are met with the sight of a man in a robe standing nearby. It\u2019s hard to see his face, but the light of the moon shows he\u2019s a lot older than you.\n\nYou lift your dagger up in a defensive stance, but the man isn\u2019t moving.\n\n\u201cPut that away son, it wouldn\u2019t do you any good again me or anything else out around here I\u2019d wager. In fact you shouldn\u2019t even be around this cabin. Bad things happen here.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cYeah? Well what\u2019re you doing out here then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cGood help is hard to find nowadays. What\u2019s your story, you look a little worse for wear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, just trying to make conversation. You don\u2019t look like one of the many bandits out here. You ain\u2019t green, so you aren\u2019t hobgoblin. Can\u2019t see any points in those ears, so not an elf either. Given your age though, what you do look like is a lost lamb in the woods. Is that what you are?\u201d\n\u201cNo and I\u2019m doing just fine out here.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit, kid. You look like a half drowned rat. What\u2019d you do, fall in the river?\u201d he says and starts to step forward.\n\n\u201cGet the fuck back old man! I\u2019m no damn lamb in the woods, I\u2019ve killed people!\u201d you say thrusting your dagger in his direction a bit.\n\u201cIs that right? Hmm, perhaps you could be useful. You just a fighter? You got any other skills?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I mean what the hell you wanna know for?\u201d\n\u201cBecause as I said, good help is hard to find and I got a lot of tasks that need doing.

Look kid, I barely even think about that anymore and you don\u2019t have the right equipment anyway. I\u2019m a wizard and I do a lot research and experiments. Unfortunately, the material that I sometimes need requires me to come outside which I\u2019d rather not do. I used to have an apprentice of sorts to help out on that front, but well let\u2019s just say shit happens.\u201d\n\u201cA wizard that does experiments? And how do I know that I\u2019m not going to be one of those experiments?\u201d\n\u201cBecause if I wanted you for that purpose, I would have already cast a spell to immobilize you and taken you back to my place already. I\u2019m just looking for someone to help me do the grunt work I don\u2019t want to be bothered to do. I can also promise to pay you, if saving your life just isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cWe can discuss that later, but I need to know if you want the job, because I\u2019m not staying out here all night.\u201d\n\u201cWell where is your place? Holgard?\u201d\n\u201cPfft, not that cess pit. Though it isn\u2019t too far from there.\u201d\n\u201cHow far is it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, I can get us there real quick. So you in or not?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with the wizard", "result": "\u201c(Sigh) It seems like I don\u2019t have that much of a choice seeing as I\u2019m pretty fucked out here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a yes I take it?\u201d the wizard remarks.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll accept your help.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, now hold still.\u201d\n\nBefore you even know what\u2019s happening, a bright light flashes before your eyes and encompasses you. You\u2019re blind for a few moments and then when you open your eyes again, you find yourself in a room with fancy paintings, expensive furniture and some heads of creatures unknown to you.\n\nJust as you\u2019re admiring the new view, you\u2019re spun around and find yourself face to face with your \u201csavior.\u201d He briefly grabs your left wrist and you feel a tingling sensation on it. Needless to say you pull away and step back.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d you exclaim rubbing your wrist.\n\u201cReally, I hardly think that\u2019s anyway to talk to the man who just saved your life.\u201d The wizard remarks\n\nYour wrist stops tingling and when you look down at it, you notice a new little symbol on your skin that resembles an eight.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did you just do to me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing bad I assure you, but I suppose much like you I\u2019m a bit on the mistrustful side, so I wanted to secure the agreement we made.\u201d The wizard says.\n\u201cWhat did you DO?\u201d\n\u201cPut a geas on you. Don\u2019t worry though you still have lots of freedom.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s a geas? And what do you mean by I still have lots of freedom? Did you just magically enslave me or some shit?!\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I hate it when it\u2019s put like that. I suppose if you want to look at it that way, then yes. I\u2019m the only one who can take it off though so you might as well not kick up about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Well I can imagine the spell also doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re dead either.\u201d You say and draw your dagger.\n\nHowever as soon as you do, you feel as if you\u2019ve been dealt a hefty kick to the crotch. You fall to the floor holding on to your nether regions.\n\n\u201cThat was a very silly thing to do. Even if I couldn\u2019t blast you into ash before you\u2019d even reach me with that pig sticker, the geas prevents you from harming me in the first place. You\u2019re just lucky I\u2019m not fond of pointless cruelty. Most of the time when one tries to directly defy a geas, it causes extreme pain throughout your entire body. I altered the spell of course.\u201d The wizard remarks.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to be glad you\u2019re only magically kicking me in the balls instead?\u201d you ask as the pain slowly begins to fade.\n\nThe wizard at this point puts a hand to his face and shakes his head. He paces a bit and then speaks again.\n\n\u201cOkay look, let\u2019s start over. Hello my name\u2019s Ral and I\u2019m your new employer until I feel our contract is done. In return for your service, you will receive lodgings and food. Quality lodgings too I might add. I will also provide whatever equipment you need for whatever task I send you on. If I don\u2019t have it, well I\u2019ll provide coin so you can go buy whatever you need at that cess pit Holgard which as I mentioned I don\u2019t live too far from.\u201d\n\nRal pauses a bit before continuing.\n\n\u201cNow before you start arguing with me again, let me tell you about the exact nature of your geas. First of all, you\u2019ve still got all the freedom you want. You want to leave my home and go drown your sorrows in whores and booze, go right ahead. Holgard\u2019s just a couple days away and I\u2019m not going to stop you. In fact you can go on a three-day bender if you want, but after that, I\u2019d advise you to start making your way back before you start feeling the effects of the spell. The pain will start in your genitals as you\u2019ve already experienced, but the longer you resist, the geas is going to start taking on a more traditional role and you will feel that pain all over your body. Depending on your constitution you MIGHT be able to last up to three weeks of defiance. No more than that though and you really don\u2019t want to know what happens.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens if something else prevents me from reaching you or I\u2019m otherwise detained?\u201d\n\u201cWell I suggest you don\u2019t let it detain you for over a week.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking bullshit. You claim I got all this freedom, but you\u2019ve just stated I\u2019m practically tethered to the area!\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know I would have thought someone in your situation would see this as an opportunity, not a reason to complain. Not to mention being grateful that I just saved your life. Despite your boasts of being a killer, you stink more of common thief. You\u2019re on the youngish side, so you were probably originally from a boring small backwoods town and going to Holgard to make a name for yourself or whatever. Well guess what? You would have been just one of many cutthroat vagabond thugs there. Your chances of succeeding would have been minute at best. If the Ebony Claw Syndicate didn\u2019t do away with you for encroaching on their territory, they would have used you up and spat you out if you were dumb enough to join them. Not to mention the whole city is a mass riot waiting to happen. Mark my words, you\u2019ll be thanking me that I did you this favor by next year.\u201d\n\nAt this point Ral tells you he\u2019s done speaking on this matter right now as he has important work to get back to. He tells you the lay out of his home, where your bedroom is and how you can help yourself to whatever food and drink you want in the kitchen. His home is your home as he puts it.\n\nHe then mentions that Holgard is west of his home if you need to go there. He also says there\u2019s a small village called Dert to the east as well which is actually a lot closer, but his opinion of that place is even lower. From his descriptions, it sounds similar to your hometown, but smaller, poorer and even more insular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a month to get accustomed to the surrounding area and your situation, but I fully expect you to be ready to perform my tasks by that time, and none of this ungratefulness any longer.\u201d He says and then leaves you alone in his living room.\n\nYou just slump down in one of the cushy chairs and despair at your new situation. Your eyes wander the room for a bit until they fixate on one of the stuffed creature heads.\n\n\u201cWell at least my head isn\u2019t up on a wall yet I guess.\u201d You say with a sigh.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 2C: Indentured Servitude\n\n\n\nYear 17\n\nA year.\n\nA year of this magical slavery has passed already and you\u2019re far from thanking Ral for this despite what he told you. It hasn\u2019t been as bad as it could be, but it certainly could be a hell of a lot better.\n\nBoredom and tedium are the main enemies mainly because Ral has you doing an endless amount of mundane tasks such as cleaning his home or gathering shit for him and unfortunately, that usually consists of various plants in the forest. Which you suppose has made you a bit more knowledgeable about the outdoors, but that isn\u2019t exactly knowledge you ever desired!\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll send you to Holgard to acquire something and that\u2019s really the only time you bother going to that city. Only having a week of \u201cslack\u201d doesn\u2019t give you a whole lot of time to go venturing out to Holgard like you probably would on a regular basis. Two days to get there, two day back. It\u2019s hardly worth it most of the time hence why you tend to do all your thievery during these mundane trips.\n\nThe thing is, you don\u2019t even really need to steal anything since everything is provided for you. You aren\u2019t really doing it for the thrills either because you\u2019re forever pissed about your situation. You\u2019re more or less doing it just to stay in practice. The only good thing is you believe your time there is so infrequent and your mark so insignificant, that you haven\u2019t ever drawn the ire or even the attention of any of the other criminal organizations in Holgard, let alone what passes for the law there.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll go to Dert to \u201cpractice\u201d though you don\u2019t really like to mainly because there\u2019s no challenge. You suppose it\u2019s just as well as you just doing it to keep your skills from rusting, because you certainly wouldn\u2019t be getting rich from taking anything from those poor bastards that live there.\n\nThe people there aren\u2019t exactly welcoming to you either and you feel like you\u2019re going to get lynched at any time. If that ever actually figured it out that you\u2019ve been stealing from the place as opposed to passing yourself off as a \u201cherbalist.\u201d (All that time gathering plants has at least come in handy for something)\n\nYou\u2019ve been trying to figure out some way of escape, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything for it. You actually did disappear for more than a week once, but you returned pretty quickly after two days of increasing pain. You can\u2019t imagine what you would have felt any longer than that. Ral didn\u2019t even seem fussed that you attempted it.\n\nKilling Ral is out of the question since about the only thing you can do is briefly think about it on occasion. You\u2019ve wondered if he has anything lying around that could break the spell, but even if you got lucky and found something of Ral\u2019s that could help you (and could actually figure out how to use it), Ral keeps important rooms like his lab and his library magically locked. (And who knows what other protection he has)\n\nSo you\u2019re stuck for now. In the meantime\u2026\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re here good.\u201d Ral says poking his head into your room\n\u201cWhere else would I be? Not like I can go too far. Can\u2019t you just track my location with the spell anyway?\u201d You say.\n\u201cMore or less, but considering it\u2019s easy enough for me to just peek in the rooms of the house you have access to, I didn\u2019t really see the need to do it immediately. Anyway, I have a job for you.\u201d\n\u201cI just gathered a bunch of plants for you yesterday!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually in need something on the rarer side, that\u2019s harder to get a hold of, I need you to get a plant called gray blossom. Fortunately I know someone who has it. Unfortunately, they probably won\u2019t be willing to give it up very easily.\u201d\n\u201cOh? So I\u2019m actually going to use my natural talents for a change?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking yes, though if you can steal from a vampire, I\u2019d be very impressed.\u201d\n\u201cDid you just say vampire?\u201d\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s the only person I know that has the plant that I need for my experiments. Or at least within the area and least amount of trouble to get it.\n\nEasy for him to say, he isn\u2019t the one that has to get it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that dismal village Dert has that huge graveyard not far from it, well she lives in one of the old crypts there. Now if you really feel your skills are up to the task, you could try to sneak in there while she\u2019s asleep during the day and get the gray blossom, but I had a more conventional trade in mind.\u201d Ral says and then produces a jar of red liquid. You can already take a guess what it is.\n\n\u201cWait, she\u2019ll just readily accept a jar of blood as payment?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just regular blood, it\u2019s a jar of sprite blood. She loves the stuff.\u201d Ral answers\n\u201cAren\u2019t sprites really small? Looks like a lot of blood for a sprite.\u201d\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s because it\u2019s at least thirty of the little buggers. Now Isabella will probably try to use her vampire abilities on you like mesmerism, but don\u2019t worry, that spell you hate so much will keep you perfectly safe from such attempts at charm or mind control.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? Well what if she decides to just rip my head off instead?\u201d\n\u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t protect you from that of course. Though she doesn\u2019t just go around killing people on a whim, indeed that\u2019s why Dert still exists at all. This is also why I\u2019m suggesting that you just give her this blood for the blossom. She might be difficult and try to barter with you or even imply violence if she got up on the wrong side of the coffin, but she\u2019s not likely to just kill you. If she catches you stealing however, well her violent reaction is going to be on you.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if that wouldn\u2019t be an improvement on my current situation.\u201d You remark.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find her in a mausoleum that says Mablava at the top front of it. From there, you\u2019ll have to fumble around and find the secret button revealing the stairs that lead to the underground crypt where she makes her home proper. I think it\u2019s somewhere on the bottom right wall. It\u2019s been awhile. Anyway, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it. I\u2019d advise you to announce your presence and state your business right away before you even descend. Probably would be best to do this at dusk when she\u2019s just getting up. If you do it in the day, she\u2019ll be asleep and she won\u2019t be pleased about you disturbing her slumber. If you wait until night, you might miss her since she might have left her home. Now assuming you didn\u2019t piss her off, I\u2019ll expect you back fairly soon. Off you go.\u201d\n\nHaving given you your orders and the sprite blood, Ral starts to take his leave as if nothing else needs to be said, but you still have some concerns.\n\n\u201cHey wait! That\u2019s it? I mean shouldn\u2019t you be giving me some magical weapon, or something silver at least?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat for? Wouldn\u2019t do you any good anyway. Do you even know anything about vampires, or just what you\u2019ve heard from stories? Look, if I actually thought your life was in any real danger, I\u2019d provide you with either the proper equipment or the coin so you could go buy it. I dare say even if you do something foolish like try to steal from her and get caught, if you drop my name she\u2019ll probably still let you off the hook, though perhaps with a nasty scar. This should be a simple enough task that you aren\u2019t going to have any difficulties.\u201d Ral says.\n\nYou don\u2019t bother arguing any more since you know Ral\u2019s made his mind up and is barking the orders that you\u2019re going to have to obey anyway. You can only hope he\u2019s correct about his vampire associate.\n\nYou make your way to Dert, which doesn\u2019t take long. By the time you which the vicinity of the area, it\u2019s still day time which means you still have time to spare waiting around before meeting up with this Isabella. Since you don\u2019t especially feel like putting up with suspicious dumb ass yokels today, you decide that you\u2019ll just head straight to the graveyard and wait there.\n\nWhen you arrive, you never realized just how damn big the place was as you\u2019ve only ever glanced at it from afar and certainly never had any reason to go there. In fact, it\u2019s almost the same size as Dert itself, in fact, it may even be the same size. You can\u2019t imagine why the village would need that big of a graveyard. Was Dert bigger at one point? Plague perhaps?\n\nIn any case you spend some time looking for the mausoleum and eventually you find it. It isn\u2019t very big; though you imagine that underneath it is where all the space is. Must be for a family, though they must have been richer than everyone else in that village. This all makes you wonder if Isabella is an original inhabitant of this village or maybe she\u2019s just making her home her in this place.\n\nYou also start wondering if there are other creatures potentially lurking about here. Ghouls? Ghosts? You haven\u2019t seen or heard anything since you\u2019ve got here and the entire place has been as empty and silent as a well\u2026tomb.\n\nAs you creep yourself out, you\u2019re getting less enthusiastic about just hanging around a graveyard waiting for night to come. Maybe you should just steal the gray blossom now while day still exists.", "action_results": [{"action": "Steal the Gray Blossom", "result": "Meeting a vampire at night just seems like a bad idea even if you were properly prepared. No, you\u2019re going to go with your instinct on this rather than Ral\u2019s suggestions.\n\nYou begin looking for the secret button on the right wall. As it turns out, this uses up a lot of time because you have a hell of a time finding the damn thing since it\u2019s in a near inaccessible place behind a solid stone sarcophagus. At this point you\u2019re hoping you get out before the sun sets.\n\nAfter stretching and reaching for the thing, you hear a click and a section of the floor on the left side opens up. You look down, but only see a dimly lit stairway, which you hope doesn\u2019t lead you through some catacomb maze.\n\nWhen you get to the bottom, you find a better-lit crypt that is fairly clean all things considered. You see several sturdy coffins lining the walls and you can also smell a faint whiff of some sort of flower. Nobody is here, though you see another entryway, which looks like it leads further into the bowels of this place.\n\nAs much as you don\u2019t like the idea, you\u2019ll have to go further in because there doesn\u2019t seem to be any plant life here or at least none that resembles what you were tasked to find.\n\nYou go through a long corridor which occasionally has smaller rooms off to the side, but you don\u2019t find much in any save for some neatly placed furnishings. Other than the coffins you already passed you haven\u2019t seen anything else like that, so you aren\u2019t sure if this Isabella sleeps in one of those and you already passed her or she\u2019s deeper within this place. Either way, you just want to be out of here before she wakes up.\n\nYou continue further and unfortunately just like you thought you start getting to forks in path. Still not knowing where to look, you just pick a path and hope for the best.\n\nYou eventually come to a room, you sort of wish you hadn\u2019t. You see several naked people chained up and the room stained with blood. The people aren\u2019t screaming or calling for help though. They\u2019re just standing there in a trance condition. You can only guess this must be some sort of feeding room for Isabella. You don\u2019t linger too long.\n\nYou continue to go through twisting corridors, which increasingly start becoming less \u201cpolished\u201d with a lot less torches and you also feel like you\u2019re starting to go deeper underground. You\u2019re starting to feel like you\u2019re not going to find what you\u2019re looking for if you keep heading this way, so you decide to turn back.\n\nAnd then you suddenly stop when you hear a voice coming from the direction that you are currently heading:\n\n\u201cI know someone is here, lurking about in my home. Hope you\u2019re a very well prepared group of adventurers or skilled vampire hunters because it\u2019s not going to be good when I eventually find you. And I WILL find you.\u201d\n\nYou genuinely piss yourself at that point and in desperation you immediately run back into darkness. You have no idea where you\u2019re going and you end up stumbling and tripping quite a bit as you make your hopeless escape.\n\n\u201cOnly one of you huh? That was quite foolish. You realize that you\u2019re making a lot of noise correct? I\u2019m a lot faster than you are and know my home better than you do, if I wanted to catch you right now, I could. You should probably save yourself time and just sit put. If you do, I\u2019ll promise to make it quick and not keep you around as a blood slave.\u201d You hear Isabella\u2019s voice say. You don\u2019t know how close she is now, but she doesn\u2019t sound as far away as before.\n\nAlone, scared and in pitch darkness, you scream out.\n\n\u201cIsabella, please! I don\u2019t want to die! Have mercy!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to die? Then why the hell did you intrude on my home in the way you did? In fact, how the hell do you know my name or even how to get in here in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cRal! Ral sent me! He even gave me a gift to give to you!\u201d\n\nThere is silence for a moment.\n\n\u201cAh, that explains some of this then. The old bastard must want something from me, and he sent a lackey to do the job. However, he must either not value your life or he\u2019s gotten forgetful in his old age, because I can\u2019t imagine that he would have told you to come wandering down here without at least announcing yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHe did! He did!\u201d\n\u201cOh? Then YOU must be stupid or not a very good servant to Ral if you didn\u2019t follow his instructions. Either way, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to miss you. This might have gone very differently had you not rudely trespassed on my domain. Don\u2019t bother begging anymore, I\u2019m not listening.\u201d\n\nWith this confirmation that you are well and truly fucked, you gather your remaining strength and continue to run blindly in the dark.

You look down, but only see a dimly lit stairway, which you hope leads immediately to Isabella since you don\u2019t really want to potentially work your way through some catacomb maze.\n\nYou walk down a few steps and then call out to Isabella.\n\n\u201cIsabella?!\u201d you shout.\n\nA few seconds later you get a response.\n\n\u201cA visitor that knows me? This is a surprise.

I\u2019ll be there in a moment.\u201d you hear Isabella shout from that direction.\n\nYou aren\u2019t kept waiting long when a woman appears from the crypt entryway. Ivory skin and long raven hair, beautiful and young looking though certainly older than you. Isabella is the exact idea of what people have in mind when (and if they bother to) think of a vampire, the only thing that\u2019s missing is the royal or elegant clothes which isn\u2019t wearing. In fact she\u2019s not wearing clothes at all.\n\nYou might be more inclined to look at her naked body if she weren\u2019t a vampire, but since she is, you aren\u2019t sure what the etiquette is.\n\n\u201cOkay, you can stop adverting your eyes, I\u2019m a vampire not a medusa. Besides, you know you want to look anyway.\u201d\n\nWell that answers that question.\n\n\u201cWell? You going to tell me what Ral wants or are you going to just stare at my tits all night?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to give you exactly one minute to tell me what the hell Ral wants or I\u2019m going to start getting angry.\u201d\n\u201cApologies, I just wasn\u2019t quite expecting this. Ral wants some of your gray blossom and in exchange he\u2019s given me this, to give to you.\u201d You say and pull out the jar of sprite blood from your pack.\n\nIsabella walks over to you and when she\u2019s right in front of you, you feel very anxious as she stares at you. You know Ral said she can\u2019t charm you, but you feel like she\u2019s doing SOMETHING to your mind.\n\nShe takes the jar from your hand and opens it, giving it a sniff. Her nose turns up and her demeanor becomes more annoyed.\n\n\u201cUgh, what is this shit? Is\u2026is this sprite blood?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cYeah, Ral said you liked it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThen he\u2019s a forgetful fool or deliberately trying to insult me. I hate sprite, it was brownie blood that I liked! Either way it\u2019s apparent he cares nothing for our time together and just wants something as usual. Biggest mistake in the recent century was going out with him.\u201d\n\nWhile that\u2019s a bit of interesting information, you\u2019re far more concerned about your own ass now that Isabella seems displeased.\n\n\u201cOkay, well I guess I\u2019ll just leave and let him know then\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cWait, where are you going?\u201d Isabella suddenly grabs your arm. It isn\u2019t a hurtful grip, but it is strong and cold. Her expression is predatory and you feel like you\u2019re about to become dinner. Maybe she isn\u2019t able to control your mind, but she\u2019s doing a good enough job of putting fear into you anyway.\n\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t suppose it wouldn\u2019t do me any good to beg would it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo. However, I can see by this symbol on your arm, you are magically enslaved to Ral and despite him being disrespectful to me, I shall not act in kind and kill you since I know how hard good servants are to come by. I haven\u2019t had one in decades. However, YOU have to make up for Ral\u2019s failings.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cSo, what do I need to do? Go collect some brownies?\u201d\n\u201cHah, well that would be ideal. But you\u2019d have to travel all the way to Gnarlwood to even find a population of them and even then I doubt you would have the means to even capture one, let alone enough to fill a jar. Not to mention that would take far too long and we need a quicker solution.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to go get me dinner and the closest location is Dert obviously.\u201d\n\u201cSo you want me to go bring someone to you?\u201d\n\u201cAh, no. Not just anyone. I want you to bring me a child. Girl, boy, doesn\u2019t matter. Youthful blood is always the best when it comes to humans.\u201d\n\nWhile you probably would have had some difficulties even bringing in a regular Dert citizen, you believe you could have justified it if you brought in one that tends to be an asshole towards you every time you visit. But a child? You\u2019re a little hesitant on that request.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I um\u2026I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhy not? If Ral told you he needed you to kill a child you\u2019d do it.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s only because this fucking spell would compel me to, it wouldn\u2019t be like I\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d\n\u201cTch. That\u2019s an excuse. You could easily kill yourself rather than kill a child. The geas doesn\u2019t prevent that.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just do it?\u201d\n\u201cSure I could, but I\u2019m asking YOU to do it. Now if you want the gray blossom, you\u2019re getting that child for me, although\u2026\u201d\n\nIsabella at this point presses her entire body against yours and sniffs you, particularly your neck.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teenager, so I suppose your blood would do. It doesn\u2019t smell like you\u2019ve been befouling it with a bad diet at least.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just going to drink a little of your blood and I\u2019m not even going to bite you unless you ask me to. I\u2019m giving you an out here. You can either let me feed on you, or go round me up a kid from the village.\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t just kill me or get so excited that you won\u2019t stop feeding on me?\u201d\n\nIsabella chuckles a bit.\n\n\u201cYou think your blood is going to be just so tasty that I\u2019m going to lose all sense of control? You certainly have a high opinion of yourself! But honestly? You don\u2019t know. But isn\u2019t the mystery of the unknown making it all the more curious for you?\u201d Isabella asks with a cold touch of her hand to your cheek.\n\u201cNot really.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell tough shit, because those are your options.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Get a child", "result": "\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll get a kid.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well, although I was a little curious to see what you tasted like. Now don\u2019t take too long, but then I imagine you won\u2019t be able to anyway, what with your tether and all. Off you go and for your sake you better not make a scene and if you do, you better not lead a peasant mob here!\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\nYou leave Isabella\u2019s crypt glad that you made it out alive, but with very mixed feelings about what you\u2019ll need to do next.\n\nWith night having fully fallen now, you expect that most in Dert are going to be in their homes. You try to remember which families have children, because in all your visits to the place, it isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve ever paid much attention to that aspect.\n\nAfter a bit of thought one family comes to mind, middle-aged couple who have a simpleton for a son who has actually bothered you in the past with questions which you believe should make your task a lot easier.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if just breaking in and snatching him in the middle of the night is the way to go though. Maybe you should take the less forceful approach on this since the boy is likely just going to scream out even if he is stupid.\n\nYou wait a bit longer in the graveyard before making your way to Dert, which by the time you reach it, is just as silent as the graveyard.\n\nYou sneak about the village until you reach what you think is the right house. After peeping into the open windows, you find that you were correct. The one you\u2019re looking for is asleep on his cheap straw mattress. You can\u2019t remember the boy\u2019s name though, so you just start whispering \u201cboy\u201d to him\n\nEventually you wake the idiot up.\n\n\u201cHuh, whut?\u201d the boy answers.\n\u201cCome on, its time to go.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you herb man? What you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m collecting a special kind of herb that only grows at night, but I need help finding it, specifically your help.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re sort of winging it here, so you\u2019re just making shit up as you go along and hoping for the best. It isn\u2019t like you have much experience in kidnapping.\n\n\u201cBut (Yawn) I\u2019m not supposed to go anywhere after night. Mommy and daddy said I\u2019m supposed to be in bed or else I\u2019ll be whipped.\u201d The boy remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I spoke to them already. They said you can help me, now come to the window, I\u2019ll lift you out.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome on, aren\u2019t you always asking me questions about what herbs, roots and flowers I collect for my profession? Come with me and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust come on, you can trust me. You see me all the time.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe boy gets up and goes to the window. The little shit is heavier than he looks, but with some effort you lift the boy up and outside. You still can\u2019t remember what his name is.\n\n\u201cWhere do we go now herb man?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cJust follow me, and be REALLY quiet.\u201d You say and soon the pair of you making your way out of the village as quick as you can.\n\nNaturally as soon as you leave the village though, the boy starts to hesitate.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026I\u2019m not supposed to leave the village. Mommy and daddy said\u2026\u201d the boy says.\n\u201cLook, I said I already talked to them, they said its fine, now come on.\u201d You exclaim\n\u201cBut\u2026but it\u2019s really dark out here and there might be monsters deeper in the woods.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going too much farther, just follow me a little more.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026that way is to the graveyard! I\u2019m not going there!\u201d\n\nAt this point your patience has worn thin and you\u2019re having difficulties with doing this anyway. Something inside you snaps and you punch the boy in the face!\n\nThe boy falls to the ground, but he\u2019s tougher than you thought since it doesn\u2019t knock him out. He does start wailing very loudly and running from you as soon as he gets up though.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you shout and start chasing him back to the village.\n\nYou catch up to him fairly quickly, but unfortunately for you, his cries have called the attention of the village, along with his parents who thought they heard noises earlier around their house anyway.\n\nAs you\u2019re struggling with the boy and punching him in the face a couple more times to shut him up, an angry mob has already formed to lynch a child abductor such as yourself.\n\nYou abandon your task and just try to get the hell out of there, but several stones thrown at you impede your escape when one hits you in the head doing enough damage to cause you to collapse to the ground.\n\nThis is all the mob needs in order to catch up to you. No amount of pleading or explanation will appease this mob and they don\u2019t even bother to lynch you anyway, they just stomp you to death as you lay on the ground and then set your battered corpse on fire.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Let her bite you", "result": "\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I mean I\u2019m flexible on a lot of shit, but yeah I just don\u2019t think I can go get a kid for you to chow down on. I mean I\u2019m not judging since I know that\u2019s what you have to do, but I can\u2019t be a part of that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, how wonderfully moral of you. So does that mean I have your invitation to bite you?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cI\u2026I guess so. I\u2019m just going to roll the dice here and hope to Yag that you\u2019re honest.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m honest.\u201d\n\nIsabella smiles and at last you see her perfect white teeth complete with the slightly large fangs. You just hope this isn\u2019t the last thing you see.\n\nIsabella pushes you up against a wall and presses up against you in a half seductive half predatory fashion.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026are you ready?\u201d she whispers in your ear.\n\u201cAs much as I can be I suppose.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI want to hear you say it. I want you to beg me to penetrate your skin with my teeth and feast upon you like the chattel you are.\u201d Isabella demands.\n\u201cWha\u2026what?!\u201d\n\u201cSay it!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Okay! I want your fangs inside me! I want it so badly! Give it to me!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nWithout another word, Isabella bites down on you and you feel her fangs enter. It hurts at first and then it\u2019s uncomfortable, but after a few seconds of Isabella sucking, you\u2019re starting to just feel weird. It\u2019s kind of sexy really.\n\nAs she\u2019s doing her thing on you, you start to feel dizzy and light headed. You think you might collapse, but Isabella is holding you up so you don\u2019t fall.\n\nOddly despite believing that you\u2019re very likely going to die, you decide to at least get one thrill out of the situation and wrap your arms around Isabella\u2019s lovely naked body and grab her ass in the process.\n\nThen you pass out.\n\nThe next day you wake up in the middle of the graveyard. Your neck is sore and you\u2019ve got a letter in your hand. You read it soon after you realize you\u2019re not dead.\n\nThank you for a lovely evening. Your blood was quite delicious; I suppose you were right to worry that I may not be able to contain myself, however I resisted much to your relief no doubt.\n\nIn your pack, you will find several gray blossoms from my garden, I hope Ral finds that adequate because he\u2019s not getting any more from me and you can tell him he\u2019s still an asshole.\n\nI have also kept the sprite blood. I don\u2019t like to drink it, but I know of other uses for it.\n\nMay your servitude to Ral end soon.\n\nIsabella\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t be a stranger, now that you know the way.\n\nA dubious offer to be sure, but at least she seems to like you, or your blood at any rate.\n\nIt\u2019s a little sad that vampire violation is the best thing that\u2019s happened to you since leaving Teckleville.\n\nAt least you didn\u2019t kill a kid you suppose and you got to touch a vampire\u2019s ass. So, that\u2019s something.\n\nAfter checking your pack for the gray blossom, you get up off the ground, rub your neck a bit, and set off back towards Ral\u2019s place.\n\nWhen you arrive, Ral is in his lab so you just go lay down since you still feel a bit lightheaded from the blood loss.\n\nEventually Ral finds you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back. Well?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cThere are a bunch of gray blossoms sitting on the table over there.\u201d You say.\n\nRal looks and goes to gather them.\n\n\u201cHm, didn\u2019t expect to get this much. Guess she really liked the blood.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d You snort.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any trouble?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. She was very accommodating.\u201d\n\u201cI am very surprised to hear that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she did tell me to tell you that you\u2019re still an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well that does sound more like her.\u201d\n\nRal, satisfied with your explanation and quite frankly just happy you got him what he sent you to get, takes his leave.\n\nYou suppose you could have told him the whole story, but would it have even mattered or would he have even cared? No to both.\n\nBesides, you figure what happened between you and Isabella was \u201cspecial\u201d enough that it should just remain between the two of you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 19\n\n\u201c\u2026and stay away from my daughter, mage minion!\u201d you hear the angry farmer shout as you run away and still attempting to get your pants back on.\n\nYou soon make it out of Dert and take a breather.\n\nEver since the citizens of Dert finally realized that you were \u201cworking\u201d for Ral, (Nobody ever really bought the herbalist story) their attitude towards you hasn\u2019t gotten any better. If anything they\u2019re even less friendly.\n\nGood thing for you they\u2019re a bunch of ignorant cowards at heart because they\u2019re reluctant to just string you up since they think it might draw Ral\u2019s ire somehow. A few even believe you\u2019re magical. You aren\u2019t really going deter that sort of thinking despite the reality that Ral could probably give a shit if you got killed or not.\n\nOf course some (like bored wayward farmers\u2019 daughters) find your \u201cmysterious aura\u201d enticing. Another type of thinking you aren\u2019t exactly going to deter either.\n\nStill, you probably shouldn\u2019t push your luck. Fear and hesitation can easily be overridden in a quick moment of violence. Then again, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got much else to do with your time.\n\nYou return to Ral\u2019s home and find that he\u2019s actually expecting you AND he doesn\u2019t have a menial task for you for a change.\n\n\u201cI need you to go get me a blood gem.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cBlood gem? Gee, that sounds like it involves vampires again.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cNo, no, no. There aren\u2019t any vampires this time around, just a lot of sotakians or lizard folk as you might call them.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know there were any sotakians in the area.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t, you\u2019ll be going to Sotak Swamp. The sotakians use blood gems in their idols, so just seek out one of those and you should be good.\u201d\n\u201cUh, not that I don\u2019t live to serve thanks to the spell that forces me to, but isn\u2019t that pretty far away? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m making it back in a week and that\u2019s if I even knew how to get around there in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, you\u2019re going to have a guide and you\u2019re going to be teleported to a relatively close to where you need to be. When you get the item and back to the original location, you\u2019ll be teleported back here.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I guess that makes things slightly easier, who is this guide?\u201d\n\nRal points to a small winged being flying in from the next room. You guess he\u2019s a fairy of some sort, but you couldn\u2019t guess what kind. He doesn\u2019t look happy.\n\n\u201cThis is Tych, your sprite guide. He\u2019ll be able to direct you to where you need to go.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cSprite huh? Weird to see one alive this time rather than just the blood.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, Tych you could say was most inspired to save his own life when I first encountered him. In return for his servitude rather than death, it was he who gathered twenty of his kind in one place and made that process a whole lot easier.\u201d\n\u201cWait, how long has Tych been here and where\u2019s he been? This is the first time I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d\n\u201cOh he\u2019s been here maybe about as long as you have and you haven\u2019t seen him because I tend to keep him in my lab where I can keep a better eye on him. Sprites, like most fairy folk tend to be tricksters and Tych in particular is one of the more treacherous of his kind. In fact you may find him to be very friendly towards you since he\u2019ll probably be trying to convince you that you two should work together to escape. I of course advise you not to listen to such nonsense that will only get you into more trouble.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, and you\u2019re sending this little devious bastard to guide me?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as you insist on sticking to the task I\u2019ve given you, he won\u2019t be able to resist helping. So don\u2019t listen to anything else he says and you\u2019ll be fine. Think of it this way, you\u2019re his direct superior and what you say goes.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure about this, but as always you have little choice in the matter so you gather up what equipment you believe is going to be useful and return to Ral who says a few words and before you know it, you\u2019re blinded by a flash of light.\n\nAs you\u2019re still shaking off the effects of temporary blindness, your guide is in no hurry.\n\n\u201cTake your time plivik. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been outside so I\u2019m going to enjoy every moment we\u2019re out here.\u201d Tych says in a high pitched squeaky voice that almost makes you want to laugh.\n\u201cWhere exactly are we anyway?\u201d you ask finally getting over your condition and finding yourself in new surroundings.\n\u201cOh we\u2019re in Gnarlwood Forest, not too far from the border of Sotak Swamp. More specifically we\u2019re in a fairy circle or an old abandoned one at least. Of course even abandoned ones have magic to them, probably why Ral sent me with you too. Makes the teleportation connection easier for him to cast. He\u2019s not nearly as powerful of a wizard as he thinks he is.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well he\u2019s still got the pair of us doing his dirty work.\u201d\n\u201cTrue plivik, but that won\u2019t last forever. If we work together we\u2019ll be able to overcome his magic that\u2019s binding the both of us to him.\u201d\n\u201cOh? How so?\u201d\n\nTych giggles a bit.\n\n\u201cRal has made a big mistake in letting me come back here! We fairy folk as you may know are magical by nature, but I cannot break our magical chains by myself. However, my village isn\u2019t too far from here and it would help the both of us plivik. With their help, Ral\u2019s spell could easily be overcome.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cWhy would they help me? I\u2019m not a sprite.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cWhat does that matter plivik? You\u2019re still a being in need of help. I can see you\u2019re not a bad person, and just like me, you are just forced to serve a bad master. If you tell me to guide you to the other sprites, we can go right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep calling me plivik, what does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a word in my native tongue. Just means friend.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re friends all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cWe both don\u2019t like Ral and wish to be free of his chains correct? I\u2019d say that already makes us have enough in common to be friends even if we just met, plivik.\u201d\n\u201cRal said you would be friendly towards me to do something underhanded and that I shouldn\u2019t pay any attention to what you have to say unless it directly involves the task.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course he\u2019s going to say that, plivik. He wants to keep us divided. He also told you that I lead twenty of my people to be ground up into into blood paste. I guarantee that I would never do such a hideous thing even to save my own life! He used a spell to capture us all and it was only by pure luck that he decided to keep me around as a pet to torment. You know he keeps me in a glass jar on his lab desk and shakes it around?\u201d\n\nYou can see how this is going to go. You\u2019re going to have to play \u201cWho\u2019s the liar?\u201d the whole time during this task.\n\n\u201cI think we should stick to the task for now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh I understand your hesitation. How about this, we go get the blood gem first and when we return here then you can decide to return to Ral or go to the sprite community I mentioned. That should give you time to decide whether I\u2019m trustworthy or not. Just think about it okay?\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cHm, I suppose that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! Now let\u2019s get this task underway then.\u201d\n\nTych goes on to tell you due to his own capture, he\u2019s hoping that his information about the area is still the same. He tells you that from your position he knows that there should be a sotakian place of worship within a day\u2019s walk.\n\n\u201cNow if we head north and then west there\u2019s a clearer path to where we need to get to. We\u2019re going to have to be careful to avoid elven patrols though. Just hope they aren\u2019t on heightened alert because that\u2019s going to make sneaking around a lot harder.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose the fact that we\u2019re planning on desecrating one of their enemy\u2019s idols would make them friendly?\u201d you say.\n\u201cA good idea, but it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Elves are a bunch of territorial assholes. They think EVERYTHING in Gnarlwood forest is under their control. As a human, you\u2019d still be seen as an interloper and most likely killed. And as for me, well let\u2019s just say it wouldn\u2019t be much better than Ral\u2019s magical enslavement.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like it would just be easier to immediately go west and bypass the patrols.\u201d\n\u201cYou would think that, but chances are it would take just as long due to all the high marshes and sinking bogs in the area. That\u2019s not even counting whatever creatures are lurking there. Not even the sotakians make their homes that way and consider it sacred ground due to the daquala population in the area.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what\u2019s a daquala?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re a creature about the size of one of your dogs but a whole lot more vicious and meaner. They can also camouflage themselves to practically be invisible. However, I don\u2019t think they would necessarily be a problem, they tend to sleep a lot and most of them should be hibernating this time of year. You\u2019re more likely to get swallowed by quicksand or a giant swamp serpent honestly. Still, I suppose if we got lucky it would cut our time by half. Up to you, plivik.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go through the swamp", "result": "Either way sounds dangerous, but if one way is going to be quicker, you might as well take that one though you have one major concern.\n\n\u201cYou sure these daquala things are hibernating?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAs I said, most of them probably are this time of year, but that\u2019s not certain. I still say the quicksand and sinkholes are more of a hazard, since I\u2019m going to be able to tell you if daqualas are in the area. Their camouflage doesn\u2019t work so well against Sprite eyes.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cGood, then you keep a look out for those things and let me worry about where I step.\u201d\n\u201cVery well plivik.\u201d\n\nBefore you set off, you break off a piece of a low hanging branch so you at least have a good sized piece of wood to test solid ground with.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take too long before you and Tych get to the edge of the forest where the ground is starting to become more noticeably wet and softer. You start using the branch as well as relying on Tych to scout ahead.\n\nTych goes on to say, he\u2019s fairly certain that there is a smaller sotakian village if you keep heading west. He also mentions that it should still have some sort of idol since the sotakians are pretty serious about their worship.\n\nAs you and Tych travel through the swamp, you find that Tych is a bit overly talkative in general. He even acknowledges that he is, but he\u2019s just so happy to talk to ANYONE who isn\u2019t Ral. Most of his talk concerns Gnarlwood and Sotak swamp and how elves are a bunch of assholes, so it isn\u2019t completely useless banter though you\u2019re more concerned with his chatter calling attention to you what with the invisible monsters possibly around.\n\n\u201cHey look, while I get that you like to talk, I also like to live. I\u2019m already not happy about being ankle deep in water, so cut with the chatter and keep an eye out for those invisible things or whatever your magical pixie eyes show you.\u201d You snap.\n\u201cPixie? I\u2019m fucking sprite, not a fucking pixie you fucking plivik!\u201d Tych angrily responds.\n\u201c\u2026fucking friend\u2026what? Wait a minute, what does plivik REALLY mean?!\u201d\n\u201cTake a guess asshole! Fucking pixie\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I fucking apologize! Shit, I didn\u2019t realize there was that much of a damn difference!\u201d\n\nTych sputters for a moment, as he\u2019s too angry to even speak about your ignorance on the matter.\n\n\u201cThere are a shitload of differences!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cWell how would I know, both of you guys are tiny and fly around with your little wings right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHow would you like it if I called you an orc instead of a human because to me you\u2019re both big, ugly and stomp around on your feet because you\u2019re not blessed enough to even have wings in the first place?!\u201d\n\u201cAh, but orcs are green and that\u2019s a very obvious difference!\u201d\n\u201cAnd pixies have less shiny wings! Have you even SEEN a pixie? They\u2019re not as pretty as we are and live around fucking fungus! If they didn\u2019t have wings they\u2019d be as low as brownies!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, keep your voice down, you\u2019re getting all excited and the whole point I was trying to make in the first place was for you to shut the hell up.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going to shut the hell up when it comes to\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then right before your eyes, you see the side of a large reptilian face pass right in front of you as it swallows Tych whole. The rest of its long legless body follows as it splashes back into the water.\n\nIt might not have been a daquala, but Tych did mention large water serpents in the area.\n\nThe serpent makes a second pass and while you block with the branch you have, you still get knocked down.\n\nNow that you\u2019re in a more prone position, he serpent attempts to coil around you. You pull out your short sword at this point and give it a few hacks, which is enough to cause it to swim away though you aren\u2019t entirely sure if it\u2019s gone. Not like the water is transparent enough to see through given how muddy it is.\n\nYou stand up and make your way out of the area as quick as you can. You dropped your branch somewhere in the water when you got knocked over and with Tych dead, you try to go back the way you came because you certainly aren\u2019t going to be able to navigate through the swamps this way.\n\nYour only hope is get back to the forest and follow the road into the swamp and hopefully from there you\u2019ll be able to find a better path to a lizard village. This isn\u2019t a good situation.\n\nAnd of course it only gets worse when it gets darker and you\u2019re jumping at every unfamiliar sound thinking that it\u2019s some beast ready to pounce. Naturally you end up going thigh deep into mud thanks to being preoccupied.\n\nYou curse and struggle at first until you remember that you\u2019re not supposed to struggle when in this situation. Of course you\u2019re waist high by the time you remember.\n\nYou stop struggling and try to find something solid to grab on to so you can pull yourself out. For once you get lucky and manage to slowly drag and twist yourself so you can grab ahold of a rotten stump.\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay. I can get out of this\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nIt takes awhile and sometimes it feels like you\u2019re being pulled in deeper by some force other than just nature, but eventually you make it and drag yourself out. You\u2019re soaking wet, muddy and tired, but you\u2019re out.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026thank Yag\u2026damn\u2026\u201d you pant.\n\nNot wishing to be in this part of swamp by the time its pitch dark, you get up using the stump once again as leverage, along with a nearby soft rock.\n\nSoft rock?\n\nAnd that when you find out your left hand was not on a \u201csoft rock\u201d at all, but a sleeping daquala who completely drops the camouflage when you wake it up.\n\nIt\u2019s so quick that you don\u2019t quite see what it really looks like except that it has many teeth.\n\nMany MANY sharp teeth.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Take the forest path", "result": "While you\u2019re going to have to stomp through the swamps eventually, if you can avoid the areas that contain vicious invisible beasts that would probably be better for your survival.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take the long way.\u201d You say.\n\u201cProbably for the best.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\nAs you and Tych travel through the forest, you find that Tych is overly talkative. He even acknowledges that he is, but he\u2019s just so happy to talk to ANYONE who isn\u2019t Ral. Most of his talk concerns Gnarlwood and Sotak swamp, so it isn\u2019t completely useless banter though you\u2019re more concerned with his chatter calling attention to you.\n\nHe has much to criticize when it comes to elves and says it was they who started the war with the sotakians in the first place. And ever since that point, now everyone else who lives in Gnarlwood forest that was more or less minding their own business has to deal with the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe sotakians were perfectly content on staying in their swamps before the elves pushed them. The sotakians would just take a few elves every now and then for their primitive sacrifices, it wasn\u2019t personal and the sotakians never tried to encroach on their territory.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine WHY the elves would take that badly.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like the elves couldn\u2019t afford to lose a few of their number given how much they rut with each other. Not to mention as I said, elves are a bunch of territorial assholes. They just used their war as an excuse to try to lord it over the rest of us that live in Gnarlwood. Demanding tribute, conscripting us to help them. Nevermind the fact that the rest of us don\u2019t have problem with the sotakians. A bunch of degenerate hedonistic imperialist assholes is what they are.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Elves generally don\u2019t have that reputation of being particularly interested in conquest, well other than the sexual kind I suppose. I dunno, I haven\u2019t really run into many save for passing by a few aggressive whores in Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well luckily for you humans, you\u2019ve already established your dominance in this land. If you were in lesser numbers, the elves would be trying to conquer you lot as well. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the elves hadn\u2019t sent out their people to go purposely mate with humans and other races to create more half breeds in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would they gain by that?\u201d\n\u201cSpies of course! Half elves would make excellent spies to gather information about the rest of the world and human governments in particular. Mark my words plivik, there will come a day when elves will try to pull their bullshit on humanity. I know you humans already tend to be foolishly entranced by their superficial looks. Ugh, dunno how anyone could find those freaks attractive.\u201d\n\nYep, Tych certainly has strong opinions on elves.\n\nMost of your journey is uneventful and despite Tych\u2019s ranting. Eventually you do get weary of the sprite\u2019s squeaks and tell him to keep it down. Tych apologizes and complies.\n\nAs night begins to fall, you decide to camp for the night so once again you find yourself a tree you can climb up and reasonably sleep in.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, plivik?\u201d Tych asks as you climb up a tree.\n\u201cMaybe you sprites can see in the dark, but I can\u2019t unfortunately. Not to mention I need to get some rest if I\u2019m going to go steal the eyes from sacred sotakian statues tomorrow.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cHm, I suppose you\u2019re right. Very well my wings could use a rest too and it\u2019ll be nice to sleep outside rather than a glass jar for a change. (Sigh) Just wish I could sleep with my beloved Gink tonight. Even the sight of her would be most welcome.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d\n\u201cYou surprised? Though I\u2019m not married in the way that you probably are thinking. There was no lavish ceremony like you big legs seem to like to have. Gink and I just bonded under the moon in private and made our commitment statements to each other. We\u2019re the only ones that matter, so why all the need for a crowd to watch?\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense to me actually.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me what?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have someone?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I mean I had someone for a few months, but it didn\u2019t last\u2026anyway I wasn\u2019t married and honestly it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever thought about. Especially not now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I suppose our predicament would put other concerns first. Remember though, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d\n\nTych flits away and goes off to find a soft leaf to sleep on. You remain awake for a little while wondering if Tych is lying about everything, telling half truths, or being completely honest.\n\nEventually you fall asleep.\n\nLater you wake up to Tych\u2019s squeaky voice.\n\n\u201cWake up! Wake up, plivik! Elves are in the area and they\u2019re on the move!\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What? Here? Now? I didn\u2019t even hear anything!\u201d you respond, suddenly waking up and catching yourself before you fall.\n\u201cWell no, they aren\u2019t right here under us plivik, but close enough! I woke up early and did a little scouting north. There are a bunch of them marching down that well trodden path that leads into the swamp. It looks like a war party.\u201d\n\u201cSo are they going to attack a lizard village?\u201d\n\u201cI would imagine so.\u201d\n\u201cI guess taking the path is completely off the table now.\u201d\n\u201cIt is until they clear the area which might be awhile.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what village they\u2019re going to attack? Were we heading in that direction?\u201d\n\u201cI actually did hear some of their conversation and they\u2019re striking the closest one on the border and fully intend on wiping it out. I think I know which one that is and it\u2019s a fairly large one. Makes sense that they would send so many soldiers. Our destination was going to be a little to the southwest when we reached the swamp. A smaller village that was further in the swamp.\u201d\n\u201cWould both of them contain idols?\u201d\n\u201cWell the sotakians are pretty religious, and they usually have one somewhere in their villages, why?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering if instead of me trying to sneak around a lizard village by myself that maybe I shouldn\u2019t just shadow the war party and snatch the gems from a village that\u2019s going to be raided instead.\u201d\n\nTych gives you a concerned look.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know plivik, that sounds pretty risky. As I said, the elves are likely to attack you as well.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right, if only because they\u2019re going to wonder what the hell I\u2019m doing there, but lizards are still going to be their primary targets. At least if I get seen, there\u2019s going to be enough distraction on both sides that I might avoid getting targeted. If I get caught in the other village, it\u2019s just going to be me by myself surrounded by lizards and I don\u2019t expect you\u2019d be much help.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWay to have confidence in me, plivik. I\u2019ll have you know I can fly about the other village without causing any attention and give you a run down on how to best approach the place. Certainly seems safer than what you\u2019re proposing.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, okay, we\u2019ll go with your idea again.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the safer course I assure you, plivik. I am also happy that you have so much trust in me.\u201d Tych responds.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\nSince you\u2019re intending on going with the original plan, Tych says that he\u2019s going to go back to watch the elven war party and let you know when the path is clear. He suggests that even when they do finally all pass by, it would probably still be best to keep off the path proper and just follow the general direction of it until you get to the swamp. From there he\u2019ll once again guide the way and scout ahead.\n\nAs Tych takes his leave, you sit back and wait. You sort of feel like you haven\u2019t been doing much on this task, though you suppose Tych IS your guide so it makes sense that he\u2019s doing most of the work to get you to your destination.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you wait, but it\u2019s enough that you end up going back to sleep for a little while. The second time Tych wakes you isn\u2019t quite as jarring.\n\nHaving been given the all-clear reassurance, you climb down from the tree and follow Tych as he leads you into the Sotak swamp.\n\nThe swamp is about like what you imagined, it\u2019s muggy, very wet and filled with a lot of little biting and stinging insects. (Though in Tych\u2019s case, they aren\u2019t all that small and he tends to perch on your shoulder for most of the way) You don\u2019t encounter anything too bad; save for a couple of the larger reptilian predators (Tych says they\u2019re crocomoths) and in both cases they\u2019re busily feasting on something else and you slip by unnoticed.\n\nDespite you practically being up to your knees in muddy water you\u2019re making good time all things considered and then that\u2019s when you hear a faint sounds in the distance coming from the north. Sounds like a horn.\n\nYou walk a few more minutes and that\u2019s when you begin to hear a lot of splashing, several voices shouting and heading in your direction from the south and getting closer by the second.\n\n\u201cThose must be sotakians!\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cShit, I just realized, that horn sound we heard was probably was some alarm from that other village getting attacked. There\u2019s probably going to be a shitload of lizards heading our way!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWe have to hide!\u201d\n\nTych at this point does exactly that and flies away! Whether he\u2019s completely left you or not is irrelevant because all that matters now is you finding your own hiding spot.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how many are heading in your direction and how spread out they are, but all you can do is hope you stay out of their sight.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hide in some tall reeds", "result": "Hiding underwater holds the danger of drowning on top of getting stepped on and getting discovered. You\u2019ll take your chances with tall reeds and hope for the best.\n\nYou run to the left and hide in a thick clump of reeds getting as low as you possibly can without actually being completely submerged.\n\nYou keep your weapon ready as you hear the splashing of several bodies heading your direction. You expect one of those lizards to suddenly stumble upon you at any time. You only hope you kill him so quickly that none of his fellows notice.\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019re paying so much attention to if the lizards are going to stumble upon you, you don\u2019t notice the nearby snake nest that you\u2019ve stumbled into.\n\nYou suddenly feel several small piecing bites in your flesh. This causes you to jump up and yell involuntarily as you quickly try to get the colorful little snakes off of you. Of course this then calls the attention of not just one, but several lizards who were running by at the time.\n\nThey notice you and after a few hisses and something in a language you don\u2019t understand, three of them move in to attack you while the rest continue their other mission of defending their settlement.\n\nBesides outnumbering you, the lizards are bigger than you and probably faster than you in this sort of environment. They\u2019re also most definitely better warriors than you.\n\nHowever, none of that really matters because you\u2019re currently in no condition to fight or flee from the sotakians. Whatever type of snakes those were, they were highly poisonous and you just got bit by several of them.\n\nBy the time one of the lizards even reaches your position, you\u2019ve fallen to the ground vomiting, your heart beating much to fast, and you feel like the interior of your body is on fire.\n\nYour eyes roll in the back of your head and then you lose complete consciousness before dying face down in muddy water.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hide underwater", "result": "You quickly grab one of the many reeds nearby, break it and put it in your mouth as you sink underneath the muddy water you\u2019ve been stomping through. You just hope that YOU don\u2019t get stomped on. Getting trampled on by multiple lizard feet would be a pretty ignoble death.\n\nOf course this isn\u2019t even counting whatever the hell might be lurking under the water ready to swim into your ear and lay eggs in your brain. (You have an overactive imagination sometimes)\n\nYou lay on the muddy swamp floor, trying to make yourself as small as possible. Doesn\u2019t take long before you hear the sounds of lizards shouting their incomprehensible language and running past you, though it\u2019s very muted and garbled due to you being underwater.\n\nDespite the water being muddy and your sight getting blurred in the process, you do see a couple of large looming figures run past from your prone position. A couple of the sotakian\u2019s taloned feet stomp near you. One right near your head, but you get lucky and none of them actually step or trip over you.\n\nStill, you aren\u2019t sure if all of them have passed so you\u2019re reluctant to move, fortunately Tych returns and flies near your reed. You can\u2019t quite make out what he\u2019s saying, but you think you see him waving his arms like an \u201call clear\u201d signal, so you sit up out of the water and catch a good breath.\n\n\u201cThat was quite the bit of quick thinking, plivik.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cAre they all gone?\u201d you ask in between breaths.\n\u201cYes, I believe so, quite a lot of them actually. From above, I could see them spread out all over the nearby area, you got very lucky. I doubt if running to the left or right would have escaped their gaze.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said plivik, I just flew straight up until they passed. Are you surprised? You already claimed I wouldn\u2019t be useful in a fight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I suppose not. Actually with that many, pretty sure I\u2019d be dead as well.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re not holding a grudge plivik. In any case, our destination should be a whole lot manageable to deal with now. I suspect only a few sotakians remain in the village so your job should be easier. I will still scout the village to let you know the best approach of course.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re really hoping that will be the case, because as sopping wet as you are now, you\u2019re not exactly in the highest spirits and are eager to get this shitty task over with.\n\nYou and Tych make your way to your destination and sure enough the sotakian village is fairly empty. There are still a few lizards around and sure enough a couple of them are guarding a big lizard statue in the center of the village with blood gems for eyes.\n\nFortunately Tych also mentions that there are some bamboo cages with elves in them. He says they look miserable and in terrible condition (he mentions that pretty gleefully), but he thinks if they got free, they\u2019d certainly try to make a run for it.\n\nSo that\u2019s your plan, you\u2019re going to create a distraction by releasing the prisoners.\n\nYou cautiously approach the village and sneak around the huts, hoping that none of the little lizard children wandering around suddenly stumble upon you. When you get to the cages, Tych wasn\u2019t kidding about the elves. They look like they might have been in here for weeks and they\u2019re skinny even for elves.\n\nHowever, when they see you, they take notice, but say nothing. You reinforce this by putting your fingers to your lips and then working on the lock. The lock itself isn\u2019t even metal, its\u2019 a simple latch mechanism that can easily be opened from the outside, so it\u2019s child\u2019s play to you.\n\nThe prisoners looks so thankful and a couple even whisper a few things that you don\u2019t understand in their native tongue, but you assume its some sort of thankful. They all start to make their way out and then that\u2019s when you nod to Tych and get out of the immediate vicinity.\n\nTych flies over to the sotakians and begins shouting at them and pointing over in the direction of their prisoners. The sotakians are a bit confused at first by some sprite yelling at them and would probably swat him down, but when they look to where Tych is pointing, they find their escaped prisoners a lot more important to chase down.\n\nThe lizards guarding the statue, along with most of the others chase after the prisoners who are now running for their lives. With the village nearly completely empty of any warriors of any kind, you make a dash to the statue and begin prying out its eyes.\n\nWhile you\u2019re not exactly slow in this task, you\u2019re certainly not fast enough to escape completely unnoticed, especially since there are still lizard children and a few mothers (At least you\u2019re assuming the remaining adults might be female, you can\u2019t tell) still in the village and notice your desecration. They begin hissing and converging on your position.\n\nWith the gems in your possession, you pull out your sword and begin making a hasty retreat out of this accursed swamp. Lizard children might be small, but they still have a full set of sharp teeth and piercing talons. They\u2019re fairly fast too, especially since they\u2019re used to this environment. You have no choice but to cut a couple of the little scalies down in your escape, but not before they lay in some good bites and claw slashes on your arms and legs.\n\nIt\u2019s probably only because of these casualties, that they stop pursuing you as the rest of them get scared and the mothers wish to keep the rest of their broods safe. (You hear some odd wailing noises behind you)\n\nEventually you put a lot of distance between you and the village. You sort of lost him again in all the mayhem, but you soon find out that Tych is never far from your position.\n\n\u201cWhew! That got intense! I almost thought you weren\u2019t going to make it plivik, with all those sotakian children trying to eat you.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was for a moment.\u201d You answer taking a breather.\n\u201cThis might be a weird question, but do you feel bad for killing sotakian children?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cI mean I know it was a matter of life and death, but still\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn right it was a matter of life and death! I didn\u2019t enjoy it if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, but then I didn\u2019t exactly have time to worry about the moralities of killing little scaly children either, who I might add were probably more dangerous than typical wild predator. Felt like I was getting attacked by a pack of animals rather than anything with higher intelligence what with all the growling, hissing, biting and tearing.\u201d\n\u201cApologies plivik, I just sort of wanted to know what kind of person you were. Just as you weren\u2019t completely sure about me, I also wasn\u2019t completely sure about you. I am glad to see you are a person that doesn\u2019t enjoy killing even if you are pragmatic by nature. It would have made me hesitant to take you back to my village even if I do desire freedom.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, who said anything about going back to your village? We got the gems, we\u2019re going back to Ral\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me, after all we\u2019ve been through, plivik? Don\u2019t you want freedom? All we have to do is go back to my village and we can be free of Ral\u2019s spell! I can even lead you safely out of this forest and have you back on your way to Holgard or whatever other human settlement you had in mind to go to. And you could even think of those blood gems as your reward for this whole shitty experience. Those have to be worth quite a bit. Not like they\u2019re common.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of this fucking swamp before I think anymore about this okay?\u201d\n\u201cVery well plivik.\u201d\n\nTych shuts up for awhile and the pair of you make your way back. You feel like once you\u2019re out of the swamp, the worst of this will be behind you. You have some concerns about potentially bumping into more lizards or even elves, but Tych is fairly confident that won\u2019t be the case.\n\n\u201cThe sotakians barely ever retreat and especially not on their own territory. Also, the lot that came from the other village will have probably cut off the elves from any sort of escape. Those stupid pliviks are going to be completely massacred. Elves deserve what they get. I hope the sotakians also hunted down those other ones and recaptured them.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\nStrange that Tych should be so concerned with your possible enjoyment of killing when he himself obviously gets a lot of pleasure from elven suffering. You get the real impression that elves must have done more to him than he\u2019s already said. It\u2019s the only explanation for his sadistic hatred.\n\nWhen you make it back to the forest, night is beginning to fall. You walk a little longer and eventually you make it back to the tree where you slept the first time you passed through this way.\n\nThe next morning Tych is buzzing in your ear about heading back to his village again. Considering you\u2019ll arrive at the fairy ring in a few hours, it isn\u2019t surprising that he desperately wants a final answer from you about the subject.\n\nHe already made some of his points yesterday. Besides the obvious freedom, you\u2019d be pretty well off with the blood gems you have.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to his village", "result": "Tych\u2019s offer is too tempting and despite a few times where he flew away and hid, he still helped you out in the long run. Ral on the other hand has done nothing but enslave you and when he isn\u2019t having you do menial labor, he\u2019s sending you on dangerous missions like this one.\n\nYou might as well risk it. If it doesn\u2019t work or Tych is just planning on freeing himself somehow, you can always just head back to the fairy ring. You can make up a story to Ral, not like he\u2019s going to care as long as he has his blood gems.\n\n\u201cOkay Tych, let\u2019s go to your village, but I\u2019m REALLY putting a lot of trust in you and hoping you\u2019re planning on freeing us both as opposed to saving your own ass somehow.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ll both be free, don\u2019t worry! Come on let\u2019s go plivik, I\u2019m really excited about this!\u201d Tych beams and flies off at a slightly faster pace than usual.\n\nYou spend the better part of the day following Tych who really is so excited that you nearly lose him several times in the forest. Several times he stops to wait and laments the fact that your big clumsy legs aren\u2019t fast enough to keep up with him.\n\nEventually you get to a point where Tych tells you to stop.\n\n\u201cOkay, hold on plivik. We\u2019re getting very close, but I better go ahead first. Not like we invite a lot of big people into our villages.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cWhere is it anyway?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up high in the trees. What? Did you think we lived on the ground like you wingless pliviks do? I\u2019m going to go see the elder and tell him what\u2019s going on, I have no reason to believe that he won\u2019t help.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m still half expecting you to just disappear.\u201d\n\u201cYou followed me this far and you still don\u2019t trust me? I\u2019m coming back plivik, just wait here.\u201d\n\nTych flies upward towards the very high nearby trees. You watch him the entire time until he completely disappears in the foliage. You continue to look up and around to see if you can make out some sort of sign of a fairy village, but you can\u2019t see anything. Eventually you stop straining your eyes and neck and just lean up against one of the trees and wait.\n\nUnsurprisingly, you\u2019re waiting quite awhile. You start thinking about leaving as it begins to get darker, but you\u2019re just hoping that Tych is taking a long time because he stopped to fuck his wife or something.\n\nTych eventually returns and calls to you as he\u2019s flying down.\n\n\u201cHey plivik you\u2019re still here! Really glad you are, I told you I\u2019d be back. I told the rest of the village and they\u2019ll all be coming down to meet you soon since we can\u2019t very well expect you to come meet us.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I said, in order to break the spell it\u2019s going to require the entire village\u2019s help. Involves a lot of chanting, magical power and shit.\u201d\n\u201cAnd shit? That doesn\u2019t sound very specific. Do you know if this will even work?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work, trust me.\u201d\n\u201cIt better because\u2026ow. what the hell\u2026\u201d\n\nYou feel a little sharp jab in your arm. At first you think an insect has bitten or stung you, but upon closer in inspection it\u2019s a tiny arrow.\n\nYou pull it out and they look at Tych who just shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\u201cHey I did say I\u2019d come back and that you\u2019d be free. I didn\u2019t say you\u2019d come out of this alive.\u201d\n\nBefore you can even make the attempt to lunge at Tych (who just flies out of the way) you are suddenly hit by several tiny arrows on all sides. It\u2019s like multiple needles going in your body and while it isn\u2019t the most pleasant feeling, it isn\u2019t the thing that kills you.\n\nThe fact that they drugged everyone of their arrow is what kills you, or rather helps lead to your eventual death.\n\nYou fall to the ground completely paralyzed, you can\u2019t even speak, but you\u2019re fully aware of your surroundings. You watch as several sprites descend from the trees. You can\u2019t make out much from your position, but it looks like one of them flies over to speak with Tych.\n\n\u201cSo you say this human is the one that captured you and the rest your company?\u201d the elder asks.\n\u201cNot by himself, but he was helping the wizard that did. I can\u2019t bring them back and I couldn\u2019t kill the wizard, but I at least hoped that bringing this plivik to the village could at least give the families some measure of justice.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t ease the pain for most, but I suppose it will bring a little closure since we never did know what the hell happened. We assumed it was elves or even sotakians.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad to be home and finally free. I thank you elder for managing to release me from that dreadful magic.\u201d\n\nAs you listen to Tych spin more lies, it suddenly occurs to you that yesterday he referred to the elves as pliviks. And he\u2019s certainly no friend to elves. You wish you had caught that before, because it\u2019s obvious that word is something insulting and given that he\u2019s been calling you that since he met you, that pretty much says it all on what he ever thought about you.\n\nThe elder tells the rest of the sprites about how Tych is to be honored by bringing home an enemy that led to the deaths of so many in the village. And in his honor he is going to allow Tych to marry one of his many daughters.\n\nSonofabitch wasn\u2019t even married.\n\nAfter a few more lies and speeches, the sprites finally descend on you to celebrate Tych\u2019s homecoming along with dispensing justice; this will take the form of a feast.\n\nYou never knew sprites ate flesh, but you soon learn first hand as several sharp teeth start chewing on your body.\n\nIt\u2019s agonizing being slowly eaten alive; especially since they\u2019re so small this doesn\u2019t kill you quickly.\n\nBut after nearly a week, your chewed and bitten body finally expires.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Head to the fairy ring", "result": "You might have very well gone with him as Tych was more or less helpful during the task and didn\u2019t display any outward signs of treachery.\n\nHowever, you did notice one thing in something he said yesterday\u2026\n\n\u201cSo what does plivik REALLY mean Tych?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t understand. I told you, it means friend.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it does.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, it\u2019s not an exact translation, but it\u2019s basically the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why did you refer to the elves as stupid pliviks yesterday when you spoke about them?\u201d\n\u201cErm\u2026I did?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you did. And given your extreme dislike of them, I doubt very seriously that you were calling them friends even if it made sense in the context that you were speaking about them. Which it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTych at this point begins to try to explain that the word has several meanings in his language and it all goes back to the complexities of sprites\u2019 rich and long history of linguistics. The whole time he\u2019s telling you this, he\u2019s also flying away from you to a safe distance, which pretty much tells you all you need to know.\n\n\u201cUh huh. We\u2019re going back to Ral\u2019s.\u201d you say.\n\u201cNoooo! I can\u2019t go back there, not after being in the outdoors again! I want to be free! Come on pliv\u2026come on friend, you really want to be Ral\u2019s slave? Wouldn\u2019t you rather be free?\u201d\n\u201cSure. But the problem is, I don\u2019t fucking trust you to be the one to help me in that task. Ral said you led twenty other sprites to their death to save your own life, I can\u2019t know if that\u2019s something similar that you have in store for me so you can gain your own freedom. For all I know you might even be trying to get me killed for the shits and giggles given how much you enjoy elven suffering.\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s not true! I don\u2019t hate humans. I wouldn\u2019t get any pleasure out of leading you to your death.\u201d\n\u201cOh? I guess that\u2019s comforting to know that even though you WERE going to lead me to my death, that you wouldn\u2019t laugh about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course I wouldn\u2019t laugh\u2026 I MEAN NO! No, I wouldn\u2019t even do that! Shit! You\u2019re confusing me!\u201d\n\u201cGlad I\u2019m not as confused as you seem to be. We\u2019re going to the fairy ring and teleporting back to Ral\u2019s place.\u201d\n\nTych tries to convince you that he doesn\u2019t have some hidden agenda, but it falls on deaf ears. Eventually he gives in and goes into a litany of swears and curses the whole time you travel to the fairy ring. \u201cPlivik\u201d comes up often, and at this point you imagine that means something like \u201casshole.\u201d Basically Tych\u2019s been calling you an asshole since the journey began.\n\nWhen you teleport back to Ral\u2019s place, you find yourself in the same location as you left. Tych looks depressed again as Ral enters the room.\n\n\u201cAh, I sensed you two came back. I must say, you look a little weathered and worn, though I suppose this task would have its challenges. I trust you didn\u2019t encounter too much trouble?\u201d Ral asks.\n\u201cWould it matter if we did?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNot really, so where are the gems?\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, and Tych was helpful? Didn\u2019t try to talk you into anything foolish?\u201d\n\u201cNope, he was completely beneficial. Don\u2019t think I could have done it without his advice actually.\u201d\n\nRal\u2019s surprised to hear you say that, and Tych even more so. The sprite probably thought you\u2019d tattle on him. Honestly, you didn\u2019t see much point in doing so though. Ral already told you Tych was treacherous, all it would do is confirm what he told you and it isn\u2019t like Ral is going to punish him any more than he already does by keeping him in a glass jar.\n\nAs far you\u2019re concerned, this might keep the pair of them guessing. Tych especially, assuming the mini-bastard has got any sort of conscience. If he does though, not snitching on him COULD help in the future. Long shot of course, but it\u2019s not like you have many potential allies at this point who might help you.\n\nEventually Ral dismisses you and Tych gloomily follows him into the lab. You take the opportunity to go clean yourself since you\u2019re still covered in mud and swamp water.\n\nYou hope by all the gods you don\u2019t have go there ever again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 21\n\nWhen you first started messing around with Lisa, she was just like all the other young Dert girls that had started taking an interest in you when you started coming around a lot more. Just a bored girl that found you to be a spark of excitement in her backwards little village.\n\nLisa however, stood out mainly because she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve or outright stupid like rest. (You still laugh about the one girl who thought she was going to force you into a crossbow wedding by having a child. Unfortunately for her, swallowing doesn\u2019t result in pregnancy.)\n\nShe managed to keep your interest and not in just a physical way. Before you realized it, you were in a relationship again. But it was nice since it allowed you a bit of escapism from your own prison like situation. (And certainly cheaper than going to Holgard whores)\n\nWhile her father has threatened you with physical violence on several occasions (As many others have as well), you and her have always found places to meet. She always listens to whatever tales of \u201cadventure\u201d you have to tell her. Sometimes you make it sound more exciting than it really is, but she always enjoys them and asks many questions since it\u2019s like she\u2019s able to experience some of the excitement vicariously.\n\nLately though it\u2019s starting to look like your stories don\u2019t quite quell the restlessness that Lisa seems to have\u2026\n\n\u201cHolgard? Oh you don\u2019t want to go there now. I think they\u2019re about to have a city wide riot or revolution or some shit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell that certainly sounds more interesting than having to milk cows all day.\u201d Lisa replies.\n\u201cYou\u2019re also a lot less likely to get killed milking cows.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but you still get to do interesting stuff all the time, what with you working for a wizard and all.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly say I\u2019m working for him. I think I\u2019ve already confided to you about my situation as far as that goes.\u201d\n\u201cYes I know and that\u2019s also a cause for me to worry about our future. It even causes me to have concerns about your feelings for me.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on\u2026you know how I feel about you.\u201d\n\u201cDo I? I sometimes get the impression that you probably wouldn\u2019t come around if you weren\u2019t tethered by the wizard\u2019s spell. I imagine we probably wouldn\u2019t have even met if it hadn\u2019t been the case. Am I wrong?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Well\u2026yes IF Ral hadn\u2019t magically enslaved me, we probably wouldn\u2019t have met. But it happened and we DID meet AND I chose you to be with. I mean doesn\u2019t that count for something?\u201d\n\nLisa doesn\u2019t answer right away; she just takes your hand and looks into your eyes.\n\n\u201cI know you probably do have feelings for me, but I also can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m just a nice distraction from your situation, just as you\u2019re a nice distraction from mine. We\u2019re both prisoners of a sort, but the difference is my cage is of my own accord.\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat I mean is I would like to leave this boring village, but the only thing that really holds me back is fear and the lack of any real skill to survive in the outside world, or at least the world you\u2019ve described to me. And I know you can\u2019t be making it all up despite you probably wanting me to believe all those impossible feats you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nLisa gives you a small hug and kisses you on the cheek, which causes you to embrace her a bit tighter than usual. You feel like she\u2019s saying goodbye to you right now, but that isn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously not going anywhere yet, but I\u2019m just informing you that things need to change a bit at some point. I know we have fun together and I hope we continue to have fun together for many years to come, but don\u2019t take me for granted.\u201d\n\nLisa goes back to looking at the sky probably still thinking about wanting to leave her boring farm life behind her while you\u2019re thinking about how much of an idiot you\u2019ve been for filling her head with tales of adventure.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have just stuck with one of the dumb passive ones could you? Why the hell did you go for the independent thinker of the village?\n\nWell it\u2019s done and to be honest it\u2019s that trait that made her more attractive anyway. It isn\u2019t like you can blame her for wanting to leave Dert. The place is duller than Teckleville ever was.\n\nIn any case, you aren\u2019t willing to risk losing Lisa even if she isn\u2019t likely to leave in the near future. You have to at least make the effort to keep her around. Your reasons are probably selfish, but she\u2019s also correct that you would miss her if she weren\u2019t in your life.\n\nThis would be a whole lot simpler if you weren\u2019t under Ral\u2019s spell. Maybe it\u2019s time for that situation to change. Of course even after all these years, you still have no idea of how to do that and Ral doesn\u2019t seem to be relenting anytime soon.\n\nOf course you do have another option and that\u2019s going back to Isabella. Despite her invitation of coming back to see her at anytime, you never have for several reasons. Still, you have pondered it many times because you believe that if anyone knows how to break Ral\u2019s hold over you, it would be her and she\u2019d probably be willing to help given how much she doesn\u2019t seem to like him.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ask Isabella to help you", "result": "This isn\u2019t even just about keeping Lisa in your life, this is about not being Ral\u2019s whipping boy anymore.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Lisa, things do have to change.\u201d You say and stand up.\n\u201cWait, where are you going?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make moves in changing my situation and by doing so, hopefully it changes yours as well.\u201d\n\nYou start to walk away and Lisa goes after you.\n\n\u201cWait! Hold on! I don\u2019t want you doing anything rash! I mean like I said I\u2019m not going anywhere! I was just talking; I mean I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll ever have the courage to leave Dert anyway. I\u2019d rather be stuck here and you still be alive!\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cLisa, don\u2019t backtrack now. You made a good point and your desires are perfectly reasonable. Why should you be stuck here? If I\u2019m around, all it\u2019s going to do is give you an excuse not to take that next step. You\u2019ll grow old and resentful that you might have done more with your life.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to do something that\u2019s going to get you killed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I should die on some fool mission for Ral anyway? You willing to risk wasting more years you could have spent doing something else? No, you had the right idea from the start. You can\u2019t be stuck here and neither can I. If I die doing this now, then at least that releases you from any excuse of staying in Dert. Also, this has been a long time coming. If it alleviates some of your concerns however, I\u2019m not going to just attack Ral. I can\u2019t, even if I thought I\u2019d be a match for him. Anyway, hopefully the next time I see you, I\u2019ll be free. Either way, you\u2019ll most certainly be.\u201d\n\nYou give Lisa a kiss goodbye and leave her to go talk to Isabella.\n\nYou head to the Dert graveyard and even though it\u2019s still daylight, you don\u2019t bother waiting until dusk. You just open up the secret entrance and head down to Isabella\u2019s \u201cfoyer.\u201d Out of some concern for your safety and wishing to show some sort of respect, you don\u2019t go any further than that and just call out her as loud as you can several times.\n\nYou don\u2019t get an answer right away and you can\u2019t even be sure if she heard you. She could be a deep sleeper. You aren\u2019t sure about vampire habits after all.\n\nYou think you\u2019re going to have to wait anyway, but you soon get an answer when you hear footsteps and Isabella appears to you in the entrance that leads deeper into her home. (Yes, she\u2019s still naked like last time)\n\n\u201cYou play with your life, waking me up like this human.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cAs I remember you told me not to be a stranger.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHmm, a minor failing on my part thanks in part to your delicious blood. However, you\u2019re here now and I\u2019m awake, so state your business and I hope this isn\u2019t related to Ral again.\u201d\n\u201cIt is, but it\u2019s against him.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You have my attention.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping you could free me of him. I mean you sort of implied you could when we first met.\u201d\n\u201cI did? As I recall I said I could kill you, but I wouldn\u2019t since I know how hard good servants are to come by. Never really said I could break a geas.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess I just sort of thought you could given how um\u2026 long you\u2019ve been around. Surely you\u2019re very powerful.\u201d\n\u201cClumsy attempts at flattery (sigh). Though I suppose you\u2019re at least trying. Look human, I don\u2019t have anything against you. Actually, you\u2019re an alright sort, but I just can\u2019t help you. Well not in the way that you\u2019d like, though I could be wrong about that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Does it require you drinking some more of my blood? Here, have at it!\u201d you say and start exposing your neck more to Isabella who steps towards you.\n\u201cOh, it would require more than just your blood to break the spell.\u201d\n\nIsabella at this point gets very close to you and begins to show her fangs. Then suddenly she looks up and sniffs the air and with a minor snarl, she throws you aside and rushes up the stairs behind you.\n\nYou\u2019re bewildered by all of it, partially due to taking a hard hit against the wall and the other fact that she just ran up the stairs and it isn\u2019t even nighttime yet.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to follow to see what it\u2019s all about, you hear some squealing and cries, which get closer. Your heart sinks when Isabella returns with Lisa and has her by the hair.\n\n\u201cIrresponsible fool! You didn\u2019t think to close the door behind you when you entered my home? I can only guess this one is from Dert. You know her?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\nYou quickly say you do, as Lisa displays her fear, sadness and probably confusion on the situation clearly on her face and her cries. You can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t know that she followed you.\n\n\u201cIsabella, she didn\u2019t know. Please, just let her go.\u201d You say in a calm manner while raising your hands.\n\u201cLet her go? Yeah, I can\u2019t do that. She\u2019ll tell the rest of those Dert idiots about me.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t\u2026\u201d Lisa starts to say before Isabella twists her hair and forces her to her knees.\n\u201cSilence! YOU don\u2019t get to say anything!\u201d\n\u201cCome on Isabella, she\u2019s so fucking scared, she\u2019s not going to say anything about you. Besides what are you worried about? Surely a bunch of stupid peasants are no match for you.\u201d\n\u201cMore clumsy flattery. Stupid peasants can do a whole lot more than you think if there\u2019s enough of them and they\u2019re angry enough. They can certainly cause me enough trouble that I\u2019d probably have to move. I chose this place because it\u2019s a nice quiet area far enough away from that city full of criminal blood bags and a blissfully ignorant village close by.\u201d\n\u201cWait! Can\u2019t we come to some sort of understanding?!\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, you always do like to make deals don\u2019t you? Well let\u2019s see, before this one so rudely interrupted us, I was going to free you from Ral. If you\u2019re still interested in that, I can oblige, however I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it? Please, if it\u2019ll save Lisa and give me my freedom then I\u2019ll pay the price!\u201d\n\u201cWell, just so happens that I\u2019d like a manservant of my own and despite this recent display of incompetence, I think you\u2019d make a worthwhile one. You certainly are no stranger to menial labor and you\u2019re at least pleasing to the eyesight.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you want me to pledge myself to you or something?\u201d\n\u201cMore like or something. I\u2019m asking you to give yourself completely over to me of your own free will. When you do that, then I can drain you dry and we can begin.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026are you proposing what I think you are?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019d just be substituting one form of slavery for another AND I\u2019d be dead on top of it!\u201d\n\u201cThe term is actually undead and really now, you can\u2019t possibly compare serving me to be the same as serving Ral. I don\u2019t see why this is such a hard decision. I\u2019ve known mortals who would have jumped at the chance you have. And given that we\u2019ve already shared a bit of\u2026closeness in the past, I know damn well there\u2019s a part of you that likes the idea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s taking everything within you to keep control of your own emotions at this point. You don\u2019t like the fact that you\u2019re so powerless to help Lisa directly.\n\nLisa doesn\u2019t say anything, but just continues to look on at you in fear and just sobs quietly. You can\u2019t tell if she wants to tell you to do it, to save her own life, or not to do it because of the consequences. Your only thought right now however, is to save Lisa.\n\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I\u2019ll do it. Just don\u2019t kill Lisa!\u201d you shout.\n\nIsabella smiles when you say that while Lisa just weeps.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? I need your full cooperation on this. I can\u2019t just go transforming you while you\u2019re under a geas unless I have your complete submission. Do I have your complete dedication to me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, whatever you want!\u201d\n\nIsabella suddenly picks Lisa up by the hair and tosses her hard into the wall. You instinctively go to help, but are stopped by Isabella who has already grabbed and stopped you.\n\n\u201cFeel free to grab my ass again if it makes you feel better about all this.\u201d Isabella says and then bites down on your neck.\n\nIt\u2019s the same as last time. First pain, then discomfort and then just a weird dizzy feeling. Soon light headiness follows and then you\u2019re starting to lose consciousness altogether.\n\nJust before you do though, Isabella stops feeding on you and then quickly bites herself on the wrist. Using the open wound, she pours some of her blood into your own mouth and a metallic taste hits your tongue and eventually slides down your throat.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t done this in a while, but I think I\u2019m actually wet with anticipation. Mmmm\u2026\u201d Isabella remarks and then kisses you on the mouth before finishing you off.\n\nEverything goes dark.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time passes, but when you wake up, you\u2019re feeling quite different. You\u2019re not breathing, you\u2019re cold and you\u2019re hungry.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you see you\u2019re in a room with Lisa who is in shackles on one of the walls. She\u2019s been stripped naked and her head hangs down.\n\n\u201cLisa\u2026?\u201d you utter as you start to stand up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry my little cryptmate, she\u2019s not dead. I keep my promises, however I obviously still can\u2019t let her leave.\u201d You hear Isabella say causing you to turn your head to your left.\n\nIsabella leans in the doorway of the room you\u2019re currently in with her arms folded as if she\u2019s studying what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t just stay prisoner here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s about the only choice available to her.\u201d Isabella replies.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just erased her memory or something? I thought vampires could control minds.\u201d\n\u201cWe can hypnotize and charm if we\u2019re up close to a mortal, but that\u2019s really more for short periods of time and just long enough for us to get someone and finish them off. Of course if we bite and release, we need to keep visiting that person to keep them docile. However, I\u2019m not really keen on travelling back and forth to Dert everyday. I prefer to keep my blood slaves in my home so I know exactly where they are. Nothing worse than your dinner suddenly regaining their free will or getting themselves killed in something unrelated.\u201d\n\u201cWait, is THAT what Lisa is for? Your blood slave?\u201d\n\u201cNo. She\u2019s YOUR blood slave. Think of this as my gift to you, along with this being your first steps in learning what it truly means to be a vampire.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t even know how to feel. You\u2019re absolutely speechless. Isabella has played a cruel trick on you. As you\u2019re still in shock, Isabella continues.\n\n\u201cNow, I can tell by your face, that you probably believe me to be the worst sort of monster, but let me tell you, this is me in a merciful mood. Your little\u2026human is currently in a trance that I put her in. Now YOU can keep her that way yourself with my guidance and in doing so, you should be able to feed on her for quite some time without having to get a new person. This should get you used to the idea of what you need to do in order to survive now, not to mention this girl was someone you had feelings for. If you can get over feeding on her then you won\u2019t have any lingering pangs of conscious in the future which will make this all much easier in the long run. Trust me, I know.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t just drink Lisa\u2019s blood and watch her waste away as I slowly kill her!\n\u201cWell she\u2019s going to waste away eventually even if you don\u2019t feed on her. In fact it\u2019ll just take longer and since I have no intention on keeping her in a trance, you can decide if you want to hear her cries and screams as she eventually gets to the point where she\u2019s begging for death as a release from this horrible situation. Or you can decide to keep her docile until she eventually just dies quietly. Up to you, she\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d\n\nIsabella talks about Lisa being in a horrible situation, which it is, but at least she\u2019s completely unaware of it, unlike you. Lisa wanted to leave her village and now it\u2019s looking like she\u2019s never going to leave this room thanks to you.\n\nYou\u2019re wishing you never came here. You feel a mixture of negative emotions right now, and maybe it\u2019s due to your new state of unlife they feel worse than you ever remember. The worst you\u2019ve ever felt was during the time you killed Klint after he stabbed Annah.\n\nRight now, your feel like that multiplied by ten, but you\u2019re desperately trying to maintain something of rational thought. Then rage takes over, rage like you never had before. You abandon all caution and attack Isabella.\n\nIsabella doesn\u2019t even look surprised. She rolls her eyes and even with your new quick vampire reflexes, Isabella easily takes you down and pins you. You snarl, and struggle and try to get up, but she\u2019s just too strong for you.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know how long you do this for, but eventually Isabella tires of your resistance and takes your head and smashes it into the hard stone floor. Would have definitely killed you had you still been human, but instead you\u2019re just left temporarily dazed.\n\nIsabella follows up with a few punches and then a display of dominance with her face transforming into something much harsher and monstrous than you\u2019ve seen before (even whenever she bit you) you briefly wonder if your own face has transformed as well since you didn\u2019t give much thought to such things at the time.\n\nWith the fight taken out of you, you finally relent. Isabella\u2019s appearance also changes back, but she still maintains her hold on you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t stay mad for long, but attack me again and you\u2019ll see how mad I can really get.\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou might as well just kill me now and be done with it then.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t seem to understand, you\u2019re MINE. I didn\u2019t transform you into a vampire just to kill you. You\u2019ll soon learn that there are things much worse than death\u2026MUCH worse.\u201d\n\u201cOh like what you are forcing me into?\u201d\n\u201cHey I didn\u2019t force you to do anything. You could have declined my offer and walked away. You gave yourself willingly to me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, to save Lisa! Not this! If I knew you were going to twist shit around\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou probably STILL would have made the same choice. Face it. You wanted to be free of Ral and you were tempted by my offer anyway. Saving your human was just an added bonus.\u201d\n\u201cStop calling her my human! Her name\u2019s Lisa and she\u2019s my girlfriend!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute, but I\u2019m your girlfriend now. Congratulations on trading up.\u201d\n\nIsabella is now just mocking you. Now that you\u2019ve calmed down a bit, you start trying to think of an unconventional way to still save Lisa.\n\n\u201cOkay. I get it. You\u2019re in charge. But maybe we can make a deal.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAgain with the deals. If I hadn\u2019t already drained all your blood, I\u2019d swear you were part infernal. Very well, this should be entertaining\u2026\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWhat if you make her a vampire?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not turning her into a vampire; I\u2019m obviously already going to have my hands full with you learning about your new vampire life. I\u2019ve got other things to do with my time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it then!\u201d\n\u201cHah! Nice idea, but you aren\u2019t nearly powerful enough to do that yet. You\u2019re not even powerful enough to turn her into a ghoul. In any case I do not wish to have another vampire here anyway. Call me old fashioned, but I believe three is a crowd and I don\u2019t see much benefit for me. I\u2019m not into women or orgies, despite all the myths about vampires being decadent sex fiends. I\u2019m also not trying to make a fucking nest. Been part of one of those before and it\u2019s worse than living around mortals. So let\u2019s stop all this nonsense about turning this\u2026Lisa into a vampire.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026just\u2026I can\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Very well I can see that perhaps this was too upsetting of a lesson. I will do it to spare you the anguish, but I really hoped you were going to be stronger than this.\u201d\n\u201cWait! You said she\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\u201cThen I can do what I want with her correct?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that because she\u2019s yours that that means you can release her, you\u2019re sorely mistaken. This isn\u2019t some contract that you\u2019ve found a loophole in. My word is still final on this matter.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but she\u2019s my responsibility you said. That means I can take care of her if I wish right? Couldn\u2019t I just keep her hypnotized and make sure she gets food and water?\u201d\n\nIsabella smirks at your question.\n\n\u201cSo you wish to keep her as you would a pet then? How long did you intend on doing this for?\u201d\n\u201cUntil I can transform her into another vampire.\u201d\n\nNow Isabella laughs and completely releases you, allowing you to sit up.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t live long enough for that to happen. You\u2019ll abandon that idea as your feelings for her fade or give in to your own hunger first. If by some miracle you some how manage it, she certainly won\u2019t be young like you are anymore. You\u2019ll be transforming her in her later years\u2026unless you transform her into a ghoul before then, but that has its own set of problems. No, I don\u2019t see this working, but if this is REALLY what you want, then sure.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying yes?\u201d\n\u201cI am. It will be interesting just to see how long you last. I imagine you\u2019ll last at least a few years even. One of your attractive traits is you obviously have a sense of loyalty and even a little nobility despite your lowly origins. However, the care for your pet will be your responsibility along with your other ones for me and if your pet becomes a problem then I\u2019m going to step in and I think we both know what that means correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cVery well then, I suppose I should teach you how to maximize some of your new powers, particularly the whole hypnosis thing. Afterwards, I\u2019ll give you the tour of my home proper, then you can get to work on what duties I require of you. While I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t find most of those fun, I can guarantee one of them will be despite however you may feel for Lisa. That being said, let\u2019s get started.\u201d\n\nIsabella takes you over to Lisa who is still in a trance. She even releases her from her shackles for this lesson. As you\u2019re listening to her instructions, your gaze briefly passes over your wrist and you realize the little symbol that Ral put on you is gone.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if the cost was worth it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\nHow the hell do you keep a vast underground crypt clean?\n\nAnswer: You don\u2019t.\n\nOne thing you never knew about vampires is how they can become obsessed with the smallest details. Probably has to do with the enhanced senses. Isabella apparently is a neat freak and due to this quirk she spent most of her time rearranging, cleaning, and generally tidying up her home. An impossible task of course, but that didn\u2019t stop her from trying.\n\nEven the room where she keeps the blood \u201cdonors\u201d is clean. Doesn\u2019t look like the slaughterhouse that one would expect it to be.\n\nUnfortunately due to being at her beck and call that means you get to help her or at least do most of it now. As one would expect, it takes up most of your time. You think between her and Ral, you\u2019ve done more housework than thievery.\n\nAbout the only thing you don\u2019t have to take care of is her underground garden, which is her own personal project that she spends a lot of time on. In fact, with you around now she doesn\u2019t even have to leave it to get food much anymore. She just has you do it.\n\nShe also has you doing her. You can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s true affection she has for you or just her basic needs that she wants satisfied. It feels like the latter most of the time, but there are moments where it seems to be more. It\u2019s just a weird situation altogether and while you\u2019d hate to admit it, its one of the better things about being in servitude to Isabella rather than Ral.\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019ve got a project of your own in the form of Lisa. You spend whatever free time you have with her. Making sure she\u2019s provided with nourishment and drink. Usually you just steal food from the farms in Dert along with drawing water from their well, but occasionally you get something different from Holgard and try to mix things up. (You never thought your thievery would ever be used primarily for food!)\n\nLisa\u2019s reactions to everything are very \u201cneutral.\u201d That\u2019s of course mainly due to the perpetual trance she\u2019s in. She is always polite and docile, and never really doing too much on her own, not that she would have much to do anyway considering she\u2019s mostly relegated to her single room. (That you\u2019ve also taken time to furnish)\n\nIsabella says that in time, you\u2019ll be able to get her to behave more like a \u201cnormal\u201d person, but the fact is, she\u2019ll always be acting according to how you want her to act. Much like a puppet. It\u2019s all pretty frustrating.\n\nThere\u2019s also a part of you that is starting to wonder about what you\u2019re doing. Are you doing this because you love Lisa? Are you doing this out of some sense of guilt? Or are you doing this just to pass the time?\n\nAt this point you don\u2019t know anymore. It can\u2019t be out of a sense of \u201chumanity\u201d because other than Lisa, you\u2019ve adjusted fairly well to the whole snatching up people and drinking their blood until they die thing.\n\nYou wonder if maybe you should turn Lisa into a ghoul, since apparently she\u2019d have a lot more free will, while still remaining dedicated to you.\n\nYou stare at Lisa who sits quietly in her chair staring in such a way that it almost makes you think that somewhere within her head, there\u2019s a part of her that\u2019s still the free willed Lisa and she\u2019s screaming to get out. Would transforming her really be any worse than she is now? It wouldn\u2019t be perfect, but at least she\u2019d be able to do more things on her own without you needing to tend to her constantly.\n\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d be in here.\u201d Isabella remarks upon entering the room.\n\u201cI finished cleaning for today\u2026or did you need something else?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cNot right now and surprisingly my garden doesn\u2019t need tending to at this moment. I\u2019m just checking up on you I suppose. Did I interrupt a potential moment of bliss between you and your pet?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, you don\u2019t need to deny anything. It\u2019s not like I care. I\u2019m hardly jealous of that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026no! No! I don\u2019t do that with her!\u201d\n\u201cWhat seriously? I figured you were just really quiet about it. Or maybe on the occasions you took her deeper into the catacombs, you were fucking her in one of the more secluded spots there. Guess that explains why you keep her clothed.\u201d\n\u201cI sometimes take her for walks because I believe she needs a change of scenery every once in awhile. And I\u2019m not having sex with her, because I\u2019m not a rapist. She\u2019s under a trance.\u201d\n\u201cSo are all the folks we keep here to take blood from, except we\u2019re ultimately killing them. You don\u2019t seem to have a problem with that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s just different.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it is\u2026but not really. I have to admit, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d last this long with her, but I guess your feelings were stronger for her than I thought\u2026or maybe you\u2019re just doing this to prove some point to yourself. Either way, I can already tell that you\u2019re starting to realize the futility of your plan.\u201d\n\u201cI want to make her into a ghoul.\u201d\n\nIsabella looks at you and just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI knew it would come to this. Look, if you really do have any lingering feelings for Lisa, you\u2019ll just kill her now and be done with it.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with making her a ghoul? You mentioned before that it would stop her from aging any more and she\u2019d still be under my influence. Are you just afraid that if I take this step, it will just bring her closer to me and further from you?\u201d\n\u201cOh you, and your assumptions. Trust me, if I really felt remotely intimidated by either of you in any way, you\u2019d both be dead. However, if you really want my thoughts on this, you turn her into a ghoul and I guarantee it will only make you appreciate me all the more.\u201d\n\u201cWell what exactly is so bad about turning her into a ghoul? You\u2019ve never gone into detail.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re probably still not powerful enough to do it even with my magnificent blood in your body, though I suppose you could try anyway. Second of all, I\u2019ve made a ghoul before and while it\u2019s true they make good servants who are completely dedicated to you, there\u2019s enough drawbacks that I don\u2019t understand why any vampire would bother\u2026unless they\u2019re really desperate for ego stroking I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what then\u2026she\u2019ll fawn all over me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and while that might sound enticing at first, I promise that you\u2019ll get sick of it. At least YOU would at any rate. You\u2019ve never struck me as the time that needs constant reassurance of how amazing you are.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, it might still be nice to hear once in awhile.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you want to hear how amazing you are, I guess we can go back to my room. I promise, I\u2019ll make it sound authentic.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to, but you actually actual laugh at Isabella\u2019s remark causing her to smile.\n\n\u201cOkay, see that right there is a good example of why you shouldn\u2019t even bother with this plan. You know you like it here with me.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m trying the best out of my bad situation. We\u2019re not exactly equals in this relationship you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh and you and Lisa would be? You and I are a much closer if we\u2019re going to go that route. You\u2019re so far above her right now it\u2019s comparing a rot grub to a human. Speaking of rot grubs, that\u2019s the third thing you might want to know about when creating a ghoul.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cFor whatever reason and nobody I know has ever figured this out. Ghouls develop disgusting habit and quirks.\u201d\n\u201cDrinking blood doesn\u2019t already qualify?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure to some it would, but how about eating bugs, dead bodies or even shit? You really want Lisa to kiss you with that mouth after she\u2019s been chowing down on a rotting corpse?\u201d\n\u201cWell can\u2019t I tell her not to do that?\u201d\n\u201cYou can try, but short of keeping her confined, that\u2019s just doomed to failure. As obedient as they are, some urges are just too powerful. And that\u2019s just the eating habits. I haven\u2019t even gotten to the weird social habits because if allowed to go out and interact with the rest of the world, ghouls tend to lack the subtlety that vampires do\u2026well most vampires anyway. You turn her into a ghoul and you better keep a CLOSE eye on her. Otherwise she\u2019s going to go wandering into Dert and probably expose herself to all the little peasant children. I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t attract attention at all.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s made a real good case against the whole ghoulification process. Though you\u2019re still wondering if she isn\u2019t just exaggerating so you won\u2019t try it. You spend time hovering over Lisa anyway; you think you could manage to keep her from doing anything weird.\n\nPart of you wants to do it just to prove Isabella wrong, but then is that a good excuse for doing it at all? Your original intent is so you could stop Lisa from getting any older and giving her a bit of free will.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make Lisa into a ghoul", "result": "Maybe your feelings have faded. Hell, maybe you didn\u2019t even ever truly love her to begin with, but you still feel responsible enough for her situation that you\u2019re not giving up on Lisa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it. I can make this work.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Isabella remarks with a bit of a sigh.\n\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m still sort of surprised that you\u2019re so permissive in all this.\u201d\n\u201cContrary to what YOU may think of me. I do have a sense of kindness\u2026or maybe I\u2019m just fond of you enough that I don\u2019t just kill the pair of you to be done with this failed attempt of courtship.\u201d\n\u201cCourtship\u2026\u201d you scoff.\n\u201cYes, that what this was, at least to me. What would you have me do? Wait around for you to give me flowers or some other meaningless gesture? Go out to\u2026I dunno the local festival? I\u2019m a fucking vampire. I take what I want and at the time I wanted you. But I can see now that method wasn\u2019t the way to go about it. Personally, I don\u2019t even think you have any feelings of love for this girl, just a sense of guilt. However, if THIS is what is going to make you happy, then fine. I\u2019ll show you how. Either you\u2019re going to come to become so disgusted with what Lisa has become that you\u2019ll finally do away with her yourself and we can try again. Or you\u2019ll stay with her and maintain your delusions. Either way the pair of you will be free because I\u2019m not going to have you both living here if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026pretty generous of you, but\u2026\u201d you start to say and then stop yourself.\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\n\u201cUm, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I already know what you were going to ask before you realized it would be stupid to do so, though again it isn\u2019t going to bother me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did you think I was going to ask?\u201d\n\u201cThat what if you just fake it for your freedom and how will I know? To the former, go ahead. If you\u2019re REALLY willing to put yourself through all this, just to be released from me, then you deserve your freedom. At least it will give me a bit of pride that I will have released a very patient one of my kind into the world. Lot of young vampires fuck up due to being impulsive. But then, I suppose you\u2019ve already had a lot of experience at being patient haven\u2019t you? In any case, we should get started.\u201d\n\nIsabella tells you that the process is fairly simple, however due to you being on the younger side, she isn\u2019t sure how long it will take, if at all. The best you can do is just keep feeding her blood on a regular basis until she starts to show signs of change.\n\n\u201cNow of course she\u2019s already a bit on the paler side due being stuck down here with no sun all the time. So the thing you\u2019re probably going to notice immediately is her starting to show signs of free will. She\u2019ll probably start by addressing you without needing to be addressed first. She\u2019ll of course also start being very affectionate, wanting to please you in every way.\u201d Isabella explains.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s different from the trance correct?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. Much different. In fact, she\u2019ll be immune to that to some degree. Her loyalty towards you will be unquestionable due to sharing of blood, but she\u2019s still going to do things on her own and it might not matter how much you tell her not to. As I said, ghouls tend to have disgusting habits and urges. In fact if you\u2019ve ever heard the tales of how vampires are a bunch of decadent sex fiends, well THAT\u2019S the reason. Ghouls that somehow manage to get elevated to vampirehood, never fully shed those more vile traits. Always best to go from mortal straight to vampire with no transition in between, like I did with you.\u201d Isabella says and strokes your face.\n\nIsabella observes you bite yourself and then feed your blood to Lisa. It actually isn\u2019t as easy as all that. Despite being in a trance, Lisa still doesn\u2019t react well to the whole blood drinking thing, especially that of a vampire\u2019s. She starts gagging and coughing even though she\u2019s also trying to follow your command of doing it.\n\nEven reluctantly forcing her head to you doesn\u2019t work and she ends up vomiting.\n\n\u201cLisa doesn\u2019t have much of a gag reflex eh?\u201d Isabella jokes, which you try to ignore and just refocus your efforts.\n\u201cHow long do I have to do this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell until she at least manages to keep some of it down at least. As I said, it isn\u2019t going to happen instantly either. You\u2019re probably going to have to do this every day for months. Possibly even more than once a day since you\u2019re still a young vampire. All I can suggest is you better make sure you keep YOUR strength up, but you better not go using up all the humans chained up in the larder. Also you\u2019re still obligated to your duties to me. Anyway, I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nYou continue to force Lisa to suck on you and eventually she keeps some of it down. You start to feel a little weird yourself so you tell her to stop and you go replenish yourself with someone in the larder, despite Isabella\u2019s warnings. You\u2019ll just have to go nab humans for her more frequently.\n\nIf she thinks all this is going to deter you, it isn\u2019t. Now that Isabella has hinted at freedom, your motivation for doing all this is doubled.\n\nYou spend months slaving away more than you had under Ral or even Isabella before all this mainly because you have to increase capturing the amount of blood \u201cdonors\u201d not just for Isabella, but for yourself. It\u2019s really tempting to just grab someone from Dert, but Isabella has always had a rule against taking too many people from there lest the ignorant peasants start getting riled up, or worse, just pick up and leave.\n\nSo it\u2019s mostly a lot of ambushing bandits, travellers and (ugh) hobgoblins in the forests. There\u2019s always Holgard too, but the journey even with your speed is still always a pain in the ass dragging someone from there since you have to keep feeding Lisa your blood at a regular interval. (Not to mention there\u2019s currently religious conflict going on there between the factions)\n\nNeedless to say, all of this makes you a lot more irritable and tired all the time (Basically, you feel like a human by vampire standards)\n\nMonths pass just like Isabella said they would, but you don\u2019t give up and eventually you start to see the signs of Lisa changing.\n\nIt starts by her talking to you and addressing you by name. She\u2019s very confused at first, but as you start to explain it all to her, she doesn\u2019t even seem to care. In fact, she seems very happy that you\u2019ve gone to so much effort to save her life.\n\n\u201cOh my beloved! I KNEW you always loved me deeply! Let me show my appreciation to you!\u201d Lisa exclaims and proceeds to jump on you.\n\nIt\u2019s a little strange, but given all you\u2019ve gone through to turn her, and she seems to be so willing, you don\u2019t turn her down.\n\nIsabella still doesn\u2019t seem fussed by this turn of events. She does seem to decrease her own demands for sex though. Cleaning is still a priority unfortunately, but considering Lisa now has all this energy she starts helping you do it.\n\nIt\u2019s during one of these cleanings that you start to see what Isabella was warning about.\n\n\u201cLisa, I bring in real food, you don\u2019t need to eat the bugs crawling around this place!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry honey, but I dunno\u2026they just looked so\u2026inviting. And they\u2019re nice and crunchy too. I like the way they sometimes wiggle in my mouth\u2026mmmm\u2026tehehehehe\u2026\u201d Lisa says trailing off into a disturbing giggle.\n\u201cLook, just don\u2019t eat them, and don\u2019t eat anything else that isn\u2019t proper food either.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but what about your delicious yummy blood?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s still fine.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Because I want some right now!\u201d\n\u201cYou just had some a few hours ago!\u201d\n\u201cBut I need it! I need to suck on you!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nYear 26\n\n\u201cWell, you proved yourself. You wanted it bad enough and I\u2019m true to my word. You and your ghoul bitch are free. Now get the hell outta my crypt, it\u2019s still night right now, so if you hurry you can find other shelter before dawn.\u201d Isabella suddenly remarks to you during one of your few moments to yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re so tired, all you can muster up is a \u201chuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard me, you\u2019re free, get out.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cNow?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes! I said get out! I\u2019m sick of you doing a half assed job of keeping this place clean and your bitch eating my food. Never mind the fact that I don\u2019t exactly get off on hearing you lot have sex. Though I\u2019m guessing that was your idea that she scream as loud as she could.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t jealous and didn\u2019t give a shit.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually. But I\u2019m certainly not going to share you in any capacity with something that\u2019s currently up in the graveyard as we speak, digging up coffins and eating rotten carcasses.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! She got out again? Why didn\u2019t you stop her?!\u201d\n\u201cNot my concern and neither are you anymore. You were fun for a while and I don\u2019t regret our time. Just confirmed my original thoughts of why I stay single to begin with. Anyway, take care and a part of me hopes that deep down that you do truly love this girl, but then I\u2019ve always been a bit of a romantic.\u201d\n\nIsabella tells you that you\u2019ve got a short period of time to leave not just her crypt, but also the area. She mentions that if she catches you or Lisa still in the area she\u2019ll kill the pair of you since she doesn\u2019t want you lingering around to possibly fuck up her relative peace by preying upon Dert.\n\nYou gather up what belongings you still value and take your leave. Sure enough when you exit the crypt, you hear Lisa snuffling about in the graveyard. You soon find that she\u2019s already dug up a grave and half eaten body parts lie all around her. She looks up from the rotten leg bone she\u2019s chewing on and wastes no time in running to greet you, though it\u2019s more like an animal loping at you.\n\nLisa attempts to kiss you, but the stench of her breath is horrible and that\u2019s saying something considering how resilient you\u2019ve gotten to such things. You turn your head away and tell her to calm herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know I\u2019m suppose to stay in the crypt, but I just got so hungry and nipped out for a quick snack since I know you don\u2019t like me touching the chained up humans in that one room. Anyway, is it time to give me some more of your yummy blood? I could use a drink after that meal! Say, do you want some of this leg?\u201d\n\nYou look at Lisa and she\u2019s absolutely nothing like the girl you were so fond of years ago. She doesn\u2019t even look the same. While she\u2019s not aging anymore, she\u2019s definitely changing in appearance in other ways. Her clothes and body are constantly dirty; her hair is a matted nest crawling with insects. Her teeth have bits of decayed flesh in them and who knows what else. She smells like the same corpses she eats. Her personality is that of a spineless lackey that isn\u2019t even completely obedient.\n\nAnd the kicker to all this is you willingly had sex with this thing repeatedly just to gain your freedom. You can\u2019t imagine the number of times you dreaded keeping up the sham.\n\nOf course it\u2019s done now. You don\u2019t really need to go through it any longer.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take Lisa with you", "result": "You can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not right. You made her into this and she\u2019s your responsibility now. For good or ill.\n\n\u201cLisa, come on it\u2019s time to go.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI know, I know. Back to the crypt.\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re moving out of there. We\u2019re going\u2026well I\u2019m not sure yet. But we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\u201cWait. So\u2026no more Isabella? It\u2019s just me and you now?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of the situation, yes.\u201d\n\nLisa can barely contain her joy. She immediately hugs and kisses you on the mouth. You taste a mixture of rotten meat and who the hell knows what else. It\u2019s foul and you immediately push her away and try not to show your displeasure.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay that\u2019s enough of that. We\u2019ll have plenty of time for that later. Right now we have to leave this area. I think we probably should head to Holgard. I know of a crypt in their graveyard we can use while we figure out our next move from there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhatever you say my love, I will follow you anywhere!\u201d Lisa beams.\n\nYou just can\u2019t beat undying devotion.\n\nYour journey to Holgard takes a little longer than you would like mainly because Lisa has the attention span of a small child. It doesn\u2019t help that she was relatively sheltered from the world as a human, having never really left Dert and then later as a ghoul confined to Isabella\u2019s crypt. So this is all very interesting to her.\n\nThe biggest concern is when you have to dig a hole in the ground to sleep during the day. You try to pick some place relatively secluded and really stress how much you want Lisa to stay in the vicinity. She of course is full of promises, but you just assume you\u2019re rolling the dice.\n\nWhen you wake up, you are happy to find that Lisa has indeed obeyed your command. You see the remains of a couple small woodland animals, so you guess she might have wandered, but probably not too far. Maybe she\u2019s starting to learn.\n\nAs you approach Holgard, you have to once again stress to her NOT to just go attacking the first living being she sees. She\u2019s heard about Holgard many times, so again this is a very big event for her. You know the only thing she likes more than eating flesh is drinking your blood, so you use that as a reward encouragement. Hopefully it will be enough.\n\nEntering and exiting Holgard is a big hassle nowadays mainly due to the religious strife going on between the various churches. It\u2019s going on year two at this point and has just gotten worse. Not to the extent the Varsakken family civil war did, but it could start going that way.\n\nStill, some intimidating looks and minor mental suggestion on the weak-minded human guards causes them to let you pass without question.\n\nLisa of course asks why you didn\u2019t just kill them to which you explain that now that you\u2019re going to be living in a city, you both need to practice the art of subtlety a lot more often. Lisa seems confused by this, but hopefully she\u2019ll understand it soon, otherwise you you won\u2019t be sticking around Holgard for too long.\n\nYou both head to the graveyard and find yourself an older one that doesn\u2019t look like it gets too much visitation and after a few adjustments, you make a space for yourself and Lisa. And as promised, you give Lisa some of your blood, which she happily accepts.\n\nWhile Lisa sucks on you, you ponder what exactly you\u2019re going to do next now that you\u2019re here. You think if it wasn\u2019t for Lisa, you\u2019d probably have an urge to just move on and go somewhere far away. Not that you\u2019ve ever been a wanderer by nature, but Holgard just doesn\u2019t hold the interest it once did when you first set out to it as a young thief so many years ago. Things have changed severely and going back to your \u201cold life\u201d in any capacity certainly isn\u2019t much of an option anymore.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that there is still that holy war of sorts going on in the city. You haven\u2019t really been keeping up on it mainly because you\u2019ve been preoccupied with Lisa, but you\u2019ve visited Holgard enough over the past year that it isn\u2019t ending anytime soon.\n\nYou still wouldn\u2019t be that concerned with it, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the Church of Joachim has seemingly turned from it\u2019s normal peace and love teachings and turned into a more militant faction that has been going on about cleaning up this stinking city of evil influences of the earthly and supernatural kind.\n\nThe supernatural part is the bit that is cause for concern.\n\nHowever, you need a \u201cstable\u201d place to stay until you can train Lisa better since just travelling here was an ordeal in keeping track of her. Until that time, you\u2019ll just have to redouble your efforts in keeping a low profile and hopefully Lisa does too.\n\nA few weeks later\u2026\n\nAfter a rare night of going out by yourself and leaving Lisa alone to her own devices, you come back and find her speaking with some woman in the graveyard.\n\nAt first you think it's Isabella, but if that was the case, she would have already killed her (And probably you) Besides, Holgard is far enough away from her territory. Plus this woman is dressed in a blue and purple robe. Isabella always went around naked.\n\nYour second instinct is to just attack immediately, but given that this woman is talking to Lisa so calmly and Lisa isn\u2019t trying to rip her throat out causes you to believe there are greater forces at work\n\nSensing that this is going to be a plate full of shit you\u2019re going to have to deal with, you merely make your presence known. The woman says nothing, but just watches.\n\n\u201cHello. This looks\u2026friendly.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMy love! I just stayed in the graveyard like you told me to, and this lady just showed up. I would have killed her, but for some reason\u2026I suddenly didn\u2019t feel like it. Maybe I\u2019m learning restraint like you\u2019re always telling me to?\u201d Lisa answers.\n\u201cWhat have you been talking about with this\u2026lady?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much. Just about how much I love you and how much you love me and how good corpses taste, but not as much as the living people! She\u2019s been very friendly for a meat sack and just asking about when you will return. Um\u2026you\u2019re not mad at me are you? Please don\u2019t be mad!\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m sure my teachings of restraint had something to do with you not killing this woman. I\u2019m very proud of you. Head on inside home, I\u2019ll be in soon.\u201d\n\u201cOkay! But not too long okay? The sun will be coming up soon and I don\u2019t want you to burn up!\u201d\n\nLisa heads back home, leaving you with the robed woman.\n\n\u201cAlright, whatever little magic trick you used to subdue Lisa, isn\u2019t going to work on me, so whatever your business is make it quick because as she said, the sun is coming up soon.\u201d\n\nThe woman nods.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too many vampires making their home in the city. Passing through on occasion, but never permanent residents. In fact I believe you\u2019ve passed through here on several occasions haven\u2019t you?\u201d she says.\n\u201cGet to the point.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. I\u2019m obviously not here to make an enemy out of you. Your business is your own. However, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that certain other groups in this city are less accepting of your activities.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fully aware of the Joachim fanatics and I\u2019ve been staying out of their way and everyone else\u2019s that matter. INCLUDING the followers of Dorna, goddess of magic. I recognize your robes, sorceress.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you have kept your head down. But your female friend seems to be less discreet. She was dancing and singing to herself while feasting on a rotten skull when I walked up. What if I had been an angry mob of Joachimites? Wouldn\u2019t have been good, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well she\u2019s still learning. I will talk to her.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a very old vampire are you?\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know if I was or not? We don\u2019t age.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but the fact that you speak with mild respect about your ghoul and even call her by name makes me believe that you\u2019re not old. Most older vampires are cynical and apathetic at best and outright arrogant and cruel most of the time. The way you interact with her is almost an attempt at treating her like an equal. In fact I\u2019d venture to guess that ghoul was probably your girlfriend at one time.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep testing my patience human, you\u2019ll learn just how cruel I can be.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m out of line. I shouldn\u2019t presume. Look, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of the troubles going on. I\u2019m not exactly sure what changes are coming, but rest assured the followers of Dorna will weather this, but we aren\u2019t stupid. We know that we are very small in comparison to the other religions here. The fact that the Joachimites gathered so many in such a short period of time took everyone by surprise I think, let alone their more violent outlook. Between them and the followers of Fel, they make up most of soldiers in this war, which hasn\u2019t completely spilled into full on war yet, but it\u2019s getting there.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you want from me?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. Or rather nothing at this time. I am merely seeking potential allies. As I said, we who follow Dorna respect magic and knowledge. We also respect magical beings and would not condemn them to die due to mere ignorance and fear. I believe if we work together, we could both make ourselves a little safer from hostile forces. In fact, we could even set you and your girlfriend up in our own private mausoleum. It would be much nicer than this public graveyard where just anyone can walk into.\u201d\n\nNice offer, but you\u2019re skeptical.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine right where we are at and as for your offer of an alliance, I\u2019m still not sure what benefit there would be for allying with you lot. As you said, you\u2019re much smaller than the rest of the factions. I mean it seems like if I was going to ally with anyone, I\u2019d be better off allying with the followers of Fel. I mean don\u2019t they have ties to the Ebony Claw Syndicate? I\u2019ve even heard rumors that Baroness Varsakken is a priestess. Seems like they\u2019re going to be on the winning team.\u201d\n\u201cWell that IS the safe bet. And it would perhaps be wise in your case to consider it. I\u2019m sure they would also welcome a vampire ally.\u201d\n\nDorna pauses for a moment as if to collect her thoughts before continuing.\n\n\u201cHowever, think on this as well. If all the rumors about them are true, they are indeed very powerful. In fact so powerful that why have they not just purged all the other sects yet? There are plenty of other rumors going around that the Felians might not even be completely united. Many of the true believers think that the Ebony Claw is a corrupting influence on proper worship of the shadow god. Even the Baroness is having a hard time keeping them all in line along with ruling the city. You ally with them and you could find yourself a pawn in whatever private power struggle they\u2019re engaged in and that\u2019s along with the external troubles coming as well.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just stick by myself, seems to be working just fine so far.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, perfectly valid. You have no reason to trust any of us. I am merely extending my hand. It\u2019s up to you if you want to take it. I will leave you to your rest. If you change your mind, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with where our temple is, and you\u2019re invited to enter.\u201d\n\nThe sorceress (priestess?) takes her leave and you head inside your home before the sun comes up.\n\nLisa of course is waiting patiently by your resting area. You open up your wrist and allow her to suck on you while you ponder your options.\n\nYou suppose that some sort of agreement with the Dornans could be beneficial assuming they\u2019re serious about providing a better place where you wouldn\u2019t be as accessible.\n\nOf course you\u2019ve dealt with one wizard type before and well\u2026you know how that turned out.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ally with the Dornans", "result": "You suppose it doesn\u2019t hurt to hear more. It is true that they need all the help they can get and it wouldn\u2019t be so terrible to have a group of wizards watching your back. You decide that you\u2019ll visit their temple tomorrow night.\n\nThe next night before you leave for the Dornan Temple, you command that Lisa is to be more careful if she ventures out of the crypt and not to call attention to herself by singing or dancing or indulging in whatever other little quirks she has. You also tell her you may even be moving to a better place soon anyway. Lisa doesn\u2019t seem to care about that so much as she\u2019s just happy to be going where you go.\n\nWith Lisa spoken to, you take your leave.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long for you to get to the temple, though you don\u2019t really travel to this part of the city as much since you prefer to stay close to home due to all the trouble going on in the city with this religious faction war. The blue and purple temple isn\u2019t excessively large but it\u2019s ornate enough looking that it stands out.\n\nThere are no obvious guards standing outside the temple, but you suspect that even with the factions at each other\u2019s throats like they are, nobody is foolish enough to assault the temple directly or even enter it.\n\nYou\u2019ve been invited though so you stroll in, if a bit cautiously since you still aren\u2019t sure if they have magic traps set up or something.\n\nWhen you enter it resembles more of a library than a place of worship, but then Dorna isn\u2019t just a goddess of magic, but of knowledge.

Heather said a vampire might be coming by and you look like one.\u201d a young man says.\n\u201cReally?

An older one stands in the middle of them all and turns his attention towards you and the acolyte.\n\n\u201cElder Flynn, the vampire is here.\u201d The acolyte remarks.\n\u201cThank you. You may take your leave now.\u201d Elder Flynn remarks at which point the acolyte bows his head and does as he\u2019s commanded.\n\nElder Flynn motions you to come closer, but you\u2019re still a little suspicious about this so you remain put.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good right here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well, I just didn\u2019t feel like shouting half way across the room.\u201d Elder Flynn remarks.\n\u201cSo what is it that you wanted to speak to me about?\u201d\n\u201cWell you came to us, I figured you had something that you wanted to say.\u201d\n\u201cYou were the one who told one of your minions to seek me out, I\u2019m just here because she said that you wanted allies.\u201d\n\u201cIf she worded it that way, then she misspoke, I told her that we wanted help not allies per say.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, so do you want my help or not?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. Your help would be most welcome. Vampires have a lot of magical energy within them by their nature. Or unnature so to speak. Even lowly ones like you have much to offer.\u201d\n\u201cGreat idea to insult me on our first meeting. So far you haven\u2019t impressed, and I\u2019ve had enough of arrogant wizard shitheads to last me a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cGood, because yours is about to end.\u201d\n\nAnd with that threat, the door behind you slams shut and Elder Flynn begins chanting something and the rest of the priests are following suit.

You eventually make progress and the door begins to give way, though whatever magic is locking it is still holding it in place. You aren\u2019t going to be able to destroy the door quick enough at this rate.\n\nYou back up from the door and even now you can hear the chanting getting louder, like they\u2019re starting to reach the end of it. You run as fast as you can and using all of your body weight and strength you ram into the door, hoping to break it.\n\nYou hit the door, which at last gives completely away just as they complete their spell. The room you just escaped from is suddenly bathed in a bright light.

After making sure you\u2019re not being chased any longer, you take a breather and then promptly swear up a storm at your situation.\n\n\u201cFuck! I\u2019m a fucking vampire and I\u2019m still putting up with shit and now I\u2019m fucking literally hiding in it! Why the fuck does this keep happening to me?!

Not that you don\u2019t have desire for revenge, but right now, you\u2019re hardly in any condition and you\u2019d be fighting an entire temple of those magic fanatics.\n\nYou briefly wonder if you shouldn\u2019t try to reach out towards the Felians, but then trying to get allies is what got you in here in the first place. Right now, the only person you can trust is yourself. Well there\u2019s Lisa, but you think you\u2019re going to have to leave her behind, assuming that the Dornans haven\u2019t already stormed the crypt and killed her already.

You don\u2019t know where, but it isn\u2019t safe for you to live comfortably here any longer. This city is probably going to suffer yet another civil war of sorts anyway, it probably would be best to leave. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to go, but you need to just start over elsewhere. Hopefully away from anymore fucking wizards.\n\nYou follow the sewers until you get close to the docks area of the city. Holgard always has trade ships leaving its harbor going to various locations. You exit the sewers and sneak aboard one of them. You think this one is going to the Delantium Kingdom, but it might be going to some place you\u2019ve never heard of, you don\u2019t really care as long as you\u2019re away from this area.\n\nNever been aboard a ship before, so this will be a new experience. Hopefully, an uneventful one. You imagine you\u2019ll get hungry on the journey, but as far as you know there\u2019s enough crew on the ship that you\u2019ll be able to get by. Just have to be stealthy about it which even in your current condition you\u2019ll be able to do.\n\nYou still don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re going to do with the rest of your undead life, but your days as a common rogue are over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Attack Flynn", "result": "That door is solid metal and probably magically locked, you doubt if you could even punch through it in time even with your enhanced strength, but you\u2019re still much faster than you used to be and you\u2019re certain that you can reach him before you can cast whatever spell he\u2019s casting.

Your days of asking for help are over. The only one you can count on is yourself and you can easily protect your own dwelling if those religious nuts come beating down your crypt door.\n\nYou need to make some improvements to your home. You pat Lisa on the head and motion her to stop sucking.\n\n\u201cCome on, we got work to do girl.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHuh? But it\u2019s almost day, aren\u2019t you going to sleep soon my love?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019re going to working out of the sunlight anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nYou (and Lisa) begin to dig out tunnels and space underneath the current crypt you\u2019re residing in. You do this over the course of several weeks, only taking quick breaks to go feed. You make sure only you leave because the last thing you want is for Lisa to get distracted. Promises and rewards of your own blood keep her happy enough that she obeys you with no straying.\n\nYou continue to work on your home and probably become slightly absorbed with fixing it, making alterations and securing it. You wonder if that\u2019s the vampire tendency to obsess about details kicking in. (You definitely won\u2019t be cleaning it though, you\u2019ve had enough of that)\n\nIsabella had an extensive catacomb system in her crypt, but due to being in a city, you have to work within its limits somewhat. For one, Holgard is a costal town. Last thing you need is the sea flooding most of your tunnels.\n\nHolgard also has an extensive sewer system and you\u2019ve had to make sure that your home doesn\u2019t have multiple passages leading into it.\n\nHowever, you do make one entrance because you ultimately decide that it probably would be better to just come and in out through the sewers which lead all over the place and make travelling around a bit more convenient if you ever need to do it during the day. Lisa also can easily find something for herself to feast on in the sewers as well. Be it vermin or potentially even some hapless bum. You\u2019d rather her skulk around down here than out in the open.\n\nYou seal up the crypt \u201centrance\u201d tight and trap it just in case anyone is really determined to go searching for you that way.\n\nThe entire time you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re keeping aware of events that are going on in the city. So far nothing out of the ordinary or more importantly, no angry Joachimites storming the streets looking for supernatural horrors to destroy. In fact, they\u2019ve been fairly quiet. The only thing you\u2019ve recently heard is an assassination attempt on the high warrior priest of Karn which the Felians are getting blamed for (Of course they\u2019re denying it) and that the worshippers of Yag somehow changed all the Dorna symbols into dicks.\n\nNot just images or representation of dicks, but actual dicks. When the Dornan priests and priestesses woke up that day, they found their entire temple literally covered in dicks (Of all sizes) from the inside and out. Fortunately this seems to have pissed off the Dornans enough to focus their attention elsewhere and as such they have not made any more overtures to you.\n\nAfter months of work, you\u2019re still making improvements (And with your new found obsession, you\u2019re likely to be always doing so), but your home is pretty much complete. You\u2019ve even taken time to furnish it a bit just so it doesn\u2019t feel like a simple cave dwelling. You imagine that the lumber yards, ironmongers, and furniture shops and don\u2019t normally get many thefts and burglaries, but they\u2019ve certainly suffered a rash of them lately.\n\nThe one thing that you weren\u2019t expecting in all this, is you\u2019ve sort of \u201cre-bonded\u201d a bit with Lisa. After having spent so much time working closely with her and doing something actually productive, you definitely don\u2019t feel the same \u201cguilty obligation\u201d you once did for making her into a ghoul.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing like how it used to be of course, but your feelings for her are approaching a fondness that you once had. They must be, because you\u2019re starting to look past her usual disheveled appearance and ignore whatever foul smells she\u2019s immersed herself in, though you\u2019ve been trying to help her on that front by providing her with perfumes, oils and incense.

You still aren\u2019t sure if you actually \u201clove\u201d Lisa, but you definitely don\u2019t mind her affection again, now that you\u2019ve gotten her to regularly perfume herself and chew on mint herbs once in awhile.\n\nIn fact, you do believe you\u2019ve trained Lisa fairly well all things considered. Even her personality has changed slightly so that she isn\u2019t a complete toadying suck up.

You might need to replace it. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get this place just right.\n\nAs you\u2019re inspecting your work, your other senses perk up. You can sense someone coming and its not some idiots trying to get into the topside crypt (It was funny how those Joachimites fell for that blade trap a few years ago). This is someone approaching from the sewer entrance, which means this is a hell of a lot more serious because you keep it well hidden.\n\nAnd this someone, you don\u2019t think is mortal\u2026\n\nYou approach your \u201cfront door\u201d to the sewers cautiously and fully prepared for a fight when you hear a muffled yet familiar voice from the other side.\n\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re approaching. Yes, you! Your essence to me will always be strong even when you make your home in the middle of some filthy human shithole.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cIsabella?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you can tell it was me, unless these sewers have completely destroyed your senses. Why the hell did you make your home in such a place?\u201d\n\u201cSeemed like a good idea at the time, besides, nobody bothers me down here.\u201d\n\u201cWell that I can certainly believe. Look, you going to let me in now so we can talk because standing out here in the muck isn\u2019t my idea of a pleasant evening.\u201d\n\u201cWith all respect Isabella, why the hell are you here? Last time we talked, you weren\u2019t exactly pleased with me.\u201d\n\u201cLong story. And I\u2019d argue that we parted ways on fairly amicable terms. You didn\u2019t really expect me to share you with that lesser being did you? I told you that.\u201d\n\u201cYou also told me, that you\u2019d kill the both of us.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that was just my way of getting you both the hell out, and look it worked. In fact I\u2019m currently extending my courtesy, by simply NOT smashing in this wall and barging in.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. This is my home and I haven\u2019t invited you in!\u201d\n\nYou hear Isabella chuckling from the other side.\n\n\u201cOh my sweet young vampire. You still have so much to learn. I\u2019m your maker, I will always be connected to you even if I don\u2019t have direct influence anymore. And that means your home will ALWAYS be my home too. So let me in or I\u2019m wrecking this not so secret wall of yours, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nYou hate these \u201cnew rules\u201d that pop up about your current existence.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, fine.\u201d you say and slide open the wall\n\nAnd there you see Isabella looking the same way as when you left her crypt. Including being naked.\n\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re still intelligent enough to know when to listen to your betters. Always liked that about you.\u201d She says and steps inside.\n\nIsabella sniffs a bit.\n\n\u201cHmm, the odor is much better in here. Ah, I smell fresh blood nearby and another familiar scent\u2026though somehow different\u2026wait\u2026is that your ghoul? She still around?\u201d\n\u201cFor your information, yes Lisa is here and if this is some attempt of trying to get me back, forget it, because we\u2019re still together.\u201d\n\nIsabella smirks.\n\n\u201cHm, guess good minions are hard to come by. No point in throwing one out right? Tell me, were the sewers her idea? In any case, I hate to break your male ego, but I\u2019m not here in some silly attempt to get you back. I\u2019m here because I need your help.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cWait, you need MY help?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, but don\u2019t think that this an opportunity to hold something over my head. I\u2019m a very resourceful woman and you are just one of my resources I need to help accomplish my task.\u201d\n\u201cHm, glad to be held in such high esteem.\u201d\n\u201cAs well you should especially because this also involves another old acquaintance of yours. Ral.\u201d\n\nAll the figures from the past are coming out tonight\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat does Ral have to do with this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe fucking destroyed my home and Dert, that\u2019s what he has to do with this! Honestly I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t heard about it since I imagine this haven of scum has a lot of gossip going on.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, as the years have worn on, I\u2019ve been becoming more of a recluse so I don\u2019t keep up or even pay attention to most of the shit I hear the mortals talk about unless it really sounds like it\u2019s going to affect me directly. If it wasn\u2019t for the whole needing to feed situation and requiring the occasional supplies to fix up my home, I\u2019d just stay down here with Lisa and never leave. Still, to my knowledge Dert was never very important and I doubt if anyone in Holgard even gave a shit about the place if they even knew it existed at all.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s gone, along with my home and Ral has to pay for that.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to have to start from the beginning and let\u2019s talk some place where I can sit and at least take all this in.\u201d\n\nYou take Isabella through some of your home and head towards one of your \u201cliving areas.\u201d Isabella remarks that she is impressed by what you have done given the limitations you had to work with.\n\n\u201cI see you tried your best to emulate the layout of my own crypt and catacombs even if they aren\u2019t nearly as tidy.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cGlad you approve. I need to stop here first.\u201d You say.\n\nAs you\u2019re passing the meat room, you see Lisa completely engorging herself on one of the whores that she\u2019s completely ripped apart. She\u2019s covered in gore and entrails and loving every minute of it. You imagine this would be a horrific sight to the other two chained up, if they weren\u2019t under a trance.\n\nLisa bloody face looks up from her feeding and grins at you, but then her grin becomes a look of worry when she sees Isabella behind you.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2026what\u2019s she doing here?! I thought it was just you and me from now on! You said so!\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cIt is, and it always will be, my grave flower. Isabella just came to visit about something and I have to talk to her about it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019re mad at me, aren\u2019t you? Please don\u2019t be mad at me! I can do better! I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll chew more of those mint herbs you want me to! You\u2019re bored\u2026you want a threeway don\u2019t you? I can go down on Isabella while you ram it into me hard. You can hurt me really good, and split me open. I don\u2019t care. Please just let me be around to still worship you. You\u2019re my love and my entire life!\u201d\n\nIsabella stifles a snort of laughter, causing you to briefly glare at her, before you approach Lisa. You kneel down in the large blood puddle and caress her face (which is sticky with blood). It\u2019s times like this when Lisa\u2019s slavish ghoul personality comes out in full force.\n\n\u201cLisa, Lisa\u2026don\u2019t get upset. You\u2019re the only woman for me and you always will be. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always stayed with you. You understand that right?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026she\u2019s back now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIsabella is just visiting. We\u2019re not getting together. We\u2019re just going to talk and that\u2019s all I swear. You\u2019re my lovely grave flower and nobody can replace you.\u201d You say and kiss Lisa who hugs you tightly. She attempts to do more than that, but you have to remind her that later would be a better time.\n\nLisa accepts your reassurances, but still has a look of concern on her face. Lisa soon goes back to eating the whore\u2019s liver, probably in an attempt to comfort herself. You stand up and motion Isabella to follow you. You fully expect to hear taunting comments, but surprisingly you hear none.\n\nWhen you get to your destination, Isabella tells you what exactly is going on with Ral.\n\nIsabella tells you that a few months ago, during one of her resting periods, her home was completely collapsed from the inside out by an earth elemental. She said it took her weeks to dig herself out and by the time she did she found that the entire graveyard was now a large sinkhole. She doesn\u2019t know what happened to the elemental since the attack just suddenly stopped like it just disappeared.\n\nLacking any other immediate choices, she decided to head to Dert and charm someone there and use their dwelling for a while until she could figure out her next step.\n\nHowever, when she got to Dert, she found that nearly all the people had been turned to stone. Not just the people though, but most of the plant and animal life in the surrounding area as well. The few people that hadn\u2019t been turned to stone were nothing but bits of flesh still hanging off bones. She proceeded cautiously since she was aware that only a few things could cause something like this, either powerful magic or certain creatures.\n\nAs it turned out, it was both. She eventually found a family of four that had been hiding in a root cellar for quite some time. They were all very frightened and assumed she was another monster to come to kill them. (Probably due to the whole unnatural paleness and naked thing)\n\nAfter subduing the father, Isabella demanded to know what had transpired in the village. He explained that a few days ago, a female creature with a snake body appeared in the middle of the village along with four medium-sized reptile like creatures, which seemed to be her pets.\n\nThere was a brief moment of confusion from both sides at first, but then the woman spoke something in a hissing type language and all hell broke loose. Most of the village was either turned to stone or ripped apart and consumed by the reptilian beasts.\n\nThe family hid in some sort of community root cellar when they couldn\u2019t get to their home proper, they told Isabella that they could hear the screams of people that apparently tried to hide as well, but the creatures stayed in the village to make sure they had wiped out everyone. In fact, the family was very surprised that Isabella didn\u2019t see them since they were certain they were still lurking about.\n\nIsabella at this point tells you that she imagines that the creatures were most definitely a medusa and basilisks. She also says neither of them make their homes anywhere near this area either and it would be rare enough for one to show up, let alone a group like that. And given that they just suddenly appeared (and then apparently disappeared at some point, since there were no signs that they left the area to go elsewhere, yet they also were no longer around) the way they did, there had to be powerful magic at work.\n\nShe goes on to tell you that both creatures do not normally make their homes in this area and it would be rare enough for one of them to turn up and wipe out an entire village, let alone a group of them. This combined with the earth elemental incident, and the cause of all this could only be Ral. She doesn\u2019t know why he would do something like this and she doesn\u2019t much care, all she cares about is the fact that Ral fucked up her home and convenient feeding grounds and for that he has to pay.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on borrowed time as it is.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cAre you sure it was him? I mean Ral was an asshole, but he never seemed to deliberately be the type to cause destruction for the shits and giggles. I mean is there proof?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need fucking proof, I got instinct! And as I said, I don\u2019t care if it was just some spell that went wrong, he\u2019s gotta fucking pay for what he did. And YOU are going to help me.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to do that? I mean earth elementals, creatures that turn shit to stone, and wizard shit on top of all of it? I dealt with Ral before and it didn\u2019t go well, not sure if I\u2019m too keen on facing him again.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re also not a weak human anymore! You\u2019re a fucking vampire with all the advantages that go along with it! I\u2019m going to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway. I just need you to get in his home and if possible try to get me in there as well.\u201d\n\u201cHow? His home isn\u2019t my home. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get in it anymore than you would.\u201d\n\u201cYes you would, you were his servant were you not? Think back. Ral invited you in to his home long before you became a vampire.\u201d\n\nAs strange as it may seem, you do remember his exact words to you during that time. \u201cMy home is your home.\u201d Weird that you never really thought about before, but then your mind was preoccupied with other things you suppose.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe I guess\u2026but I just don\u2019t see how any of this is my problem! YOU said you released me and I thought\u2026perhaps foolishly that you were at least a woman with a sense of honor. I mean I stayed out of your way and made a life for myself elsewhere, I don\u2019t see why I should have to help you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t even want to do this even out of a sense of revenge on Ral?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe at one time I would have if I\u2019d known I could enter his home so easily. But now? It\u2019s all in the past and I\u2019ve made a life not just for myself here, but for Lisa as well. I just don\u2019t see why I should go potentially fucking that up when things are good. I mean\u2026obviously you\u2019re a hundred times more powerful than me and I can\u2019t stop you from forcing me to help you under threat of death, but\u2026I dunno\u2026whatever\u2026I just thought things were finally going well for me.\u201d\n\nYou slump in your chair and despair a bit about your situation. Isabella studies you a moment and then addresses you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re right about everything. I did release you and you aren\u2019t really any under obligation to help. You\u2019re also right in that I could just threaten to kill you and your little fuck toy if you don\u2019t help me, though I\u2019d probably go for extended torture since I don\u2019t think you\u2019d fear immediate death as much.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cSo where are we then?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to give you a reasonable compromise, because I still have a soft spot for you. If you help me kill Ral, I can promise that I will never darken your path again. At least not on purpose. However, if you don\u2019t want to help me in that way, I\u2019m going to give you another option and that is you must leave this place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help me kill Ral, I need to plan another method of attack without you, and for that, I\u2019m going to need my own home to do that from. I don\u2019t want to waste time finding or building my own right now, so yours\u2026such as it is, will have to do. Give me this place and I will never darken your doorstep again.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s mostly because I won\u2019t have a doorstep any longer.\u201d\n\u201cWell be that as it may, the option is there. You can be truly free and go find somewhere else to live. I don\u2019t doubt you couldn\u2019t set yourself up just as well somewhere else, but I also don\u2019t doubt that somewhere within you, that you wouldn\u2019t mind getting revenge on Ral.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Isabella", "result": "You really don\u2019t want to start all over again with finding or building another home. You\u2019re comfortable here and don\u2019t want to move. So if this one last thing means you get to stay here, then so be it.\n\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll help, but what if I can\u2019t get in anyway?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, we might have to come back to reassess a new plan. I\u2019m almost sure that you will be able to get in though.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cI sure hope so, because as much as I want to keep my home and perhaps even not mind the revenge bit, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m prepared to be in a perpetual stalemate where I\u2019m sharing this place with you. I\u2019d rather just pick up and leave I think.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable, and that\u2019s certainly your choice if it comes to that, but let\u2019s keep positive thoughts. So, are you ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, now?\u201d\n\u201cWell sure. The night is still young and I figured you wanted to get this over with as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, but I think I\u2019m going to need at least a little time to explain this Lisa.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for? Just say you\u2019re leaving and will be back in a day or two. It isn\u2019t like she\u2019s going to leave you and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be satisfied if you tell her she can eat those two girls I saw chained up. Ghouls are easily distracted and appeased, I\u2019m sure you well know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and I\u2019m sure that YOU well know that I treat Lisa as an equal, not like some pet!\u201d\n\u201cOf course you do. Very well, talk to your child then, I will see you in the (ugh) sewers.\u201d\n\nIsabella takes her leave and you\u2019re about to head back to the meat room, when you notice blood puddles and small trails in the hallway. You follow them to a small dead end to another tunnel you\u2019ve been recently working on and that\u2019s where you find Lisa huddled in a corner chewing on a bone and making a weird (yet relatively quiet) noise. Almost like she\u2019s crying, but not quite.\n\nShe looks up at you mournfully.\n\n\u201cLisa, I\u2019m not mad if you were listening to us.\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving with her aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cI have to if we want to keep our home. Don\u2019t you want us to keep the home we\u2019ve made here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want you to go. I need you\u2026can\u2019t\u2026can\u2019t I come with you?\u201d\n\u201cLisa, it\u2019s going to be really dangerous. I mean I\u2019m sure you remember my stories about Ral. We\u2019re going to be going up against him and I don\u2019t want to worry about you getting hurt.\u201d\n\u201cBut I could help! I want to help! Please let me help!\u201d Lisa says grabbing your arm with fanatical dedication in her eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s against your better judgment, but if you leave her here she could just get into trouble anyway. Perhaps even more without you close by and her probably getting depressed about the situation.\n\nIf you take her with you, at least you can keep an eye on her and she\u2019ll be happy. It\u2019s one more factor to worry about, but if you\u2019re really serious about trying to treat her like an equal, keeping her contained like pet (or child as Isabella said) isn\u2019t the way to go about it. Besides Lisa isn\u2019t defenseless.\n\n\u201cVery well, but you REALLY need to obey all my commands during this task. Seriously, you can\u2019t go wandering off in search of food or any else of the sort. You need to follow all my orders to the letter. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cI do! I do my love! Oh thank you! I\u2019ll be a big help! You\u2019ll see!\u201d\n\nLisa showers you with a lot of affection and as usual she goes for the crotch immediately. You half think about stopping her since this is going to take awhile and you\u2019re supposed to be on your way to Ral\u2019s, but you feel like Lisa deserves a reward for dealing with all this (And hell, so do you) so\u2026\n\nLater, you meet Isabella who is still standing in the sewers close to your secret wall.\n\n\u201cAbout fucking time. Don\u2019t tell me, I already know what you were doing\u2026aaaand I see we now have a loadstone with us. Fantastic!\u201d Isabella remarks when she sees Lisa behind you. Lisa looks down a bit when Isabella calls her out.\n\u201cLook, she can be of help. It\u2019s going to take us a couple days to get to Ral\u2019s so it might be useful to have someone that can at least scout around during the day while we sleep in the ground.\u201d\n\u201cMore like give ourselves away. Fine, I suppose she would be useful fodder if worse comes to worse. Let\u2019s go, we\u2019ve already wasted\u2026\u201d\n\nYou place one hand on Isabella\u2019s shoulder and spin her around when she turns her back on you.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get one thing fucking straight. Lisa is NOT fodder. She\u2019s not a minion, she\u2019s not my fuck toy, she\u2019s not a child, she\u2019s not a fucking pet! Lisa is my fucking mate. She came because she wants to help me and I want her to help me. This, what we\u2019re doing right now? Is to help you. However, if you keep insulting Lisa and being a general bitch to her, you can go do this on your own and both of us will find some place else to live. I\u2019m putting up with a lot of things and I\u2019m not trying to step out of line against my so called betters, but I\u2019m not going to put up with how you talk to and about her! AGH SHIT!\u201d\n\nIsabella quickly grabs your wrist twists it and throws you to the hard floor face first. Lisa, rushes to attack, but is easily slapped aside into the nearby wall as Isabella applies pressure to your arm and shoves her knee into your back.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t you EVER fucking touch me again uninvited! You lost that privilege a long time ago. This is your ONLY warning about it. Second\u2026fine. I apologize. I was not behaving in a way befitting of my class. I won\u2019t insult your lady again. Glad to see that it really was true love.\u201d\n\nIsabella gets off you and you wince a bit in lingering pain as you stand up. You then go over to Lisa and ask if she\u2019s okay, to which she replies that she is. You then both follow Isabella who has walked ahead of you.\n\nThings are silent for more or less during the journey out of Holgard. It\u2019s sort of a weird silence and soon after you\u2019re making your way through the forest, you make conversation.\n\n\u201cSo, while I can imagine what happened, what did you do with the family you found in that root cellar?\u201d you ask\n\u201cOh them? Well I had to rebuild my strength after being stuck underground for weeks, so after they told me what happened, drained all of them.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cYep, figured as much.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I might have kept three of them alive under normal circumstances, but it wasn\u2019t the normal circumstances and I do have a weakness for children\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\u201cDid\u2026did the children taste sweet?\u201d Lisa suddenly asks.\n\nIsabella smiles a bit.\n\n\u201cYes, the children did taste sweet. Their blood usually does though unless they\u2019re horrible greenskins. Rather go hungry than drink their blood, no matter what age most of the time.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cSome greenskins aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re always very tough. They are an acquired taste and even the dead sometimes taste better than the average hobgoblin.\u201d Lisa remarks.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have a very versatile palate Lisa, not many can boast such a talent.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s remark could be taken as a backhanded compliment at best or a sarcastic insult at worst, but Lisa seems to take what she said as a benign praise, so you let it go.\n\nEventually dawn starts to arrive and you and Isabella take shelter in the ground. Lisa herself never seems to require as much sleep, so she\u2019ll be still be wandering around for some of the day (Though still probably trying to stay in the shade which shouldn\u2019t be a problem due to being in a forest).\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if you should have her do a little scouting while you\u2019re asleep or have her protect your resting area though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Protect your resting area", "result": "You thought about letting Lisa scout ahead before the journey started, but you\u2019ve sort of reassessed that idea. You still remember when you were a human and how you easily got lost in this damn forest, which is what caused you to bump into Ral in the first place.\n\nYou\u2019ve traveled this area so much in the past that it would take a lot of effort to get yourself lost again, but Lisa really hasn\u2019t. Granted you\u2019d be able to track her down if she got lost, but you\u2019d rather not waste time looking for her as soon as you wake up.\n\n\u201cLisa, I want you to stay in this general area, okay? You\u2019ll be guarding my resting place. You don\u2019t want some animal or person to come digging me up while the sun is out do you?\u201d you say.\n\u201cNever! I\u2019ll stay here my love and make sure your rest isn\u2019t disturbed!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you this evening.\u201d You say and kiss Lisa before digging yourself a shallow hole to sleep in. (Lisa helps pat down the dirt to make sure you\u2019re completely covered)\n\nLater\u2026\n\nYou wake up as your usual internal \u201cclock\u201d tells you to do so and dig yourself out to a nice moonlit night. Lisa stands by with Isabella who has woken up before you. Lisa wastes no time in trying to brush the dirt off of you. (And popping the occasional insect in her mouth while doing it)\n\n\u201cAbout time you got up. I got information to tell you.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cHow long you been awake?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLonger than you have. I would have woken you sooner, but I figured I\u2019d do my own scouting ahead first. I haven\u2019t been back that long.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what do you have to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones heading to Ral\u2019s tower. There are a group of six people in blue and purple robes camped not far from here.\u201d\n\u201cThose sound like Dornans. In all the time I was slaving for Ral, I never knew him to worship Dorna.\u201d\n\u201cHe never did when I was on better terms with him either. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever revered anything except maybe his own magical research.\u201d\n\u201cYou think maybe all this is the work of the Dornans?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly sure, but given that they\u2019re dedicated to the Goddess of magic, maybe they\u2019re investigating all the weird shit going on in this area. If anyone else knew about it, cared about it and was also equipped to handle whatever is going on, it would be them. Of course, they\u2019re probably unlikely to just tell us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably very likely to just try to kill us. I got approached by one a few years back proposing an alliance and I didn\u2019t trust them then.\u201d\n\u201cSmart move. We need to get rid of all but one. The last one we can interrogate and then kill them. I\u2019m not exactly sure just how magically talented these folks are, but unless they\u2019re all mostly acolytes, six of them are still enough to give more than enough trouble. And if they\u2019re heading to Ral\u2019s place, I\u2019d very much believe that most, if not all are very competent spell slingers and far beyond being mere acolytes. It would probably help to have a distraction.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t suggesting Lisa.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m suggesting you. No offense to your lady, but Lisa would potentially be a liability. They\u2019d just take control of her and turn her against us.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately you\u2019re probably right. Very well, what exactly do you want me to do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much, just go up to their camp and start talking with them. They probably won\u2019t even attack right away since they\u2019ll be too arrogant to believe that they\u2019re in any real danger. If I\u2019ve learned anything wizard types love to go on about their own relative importance when given the chance. I can probably take down two or three of them by surprise. Hopefully you can take out at least one. The remaining ones should at least even up the odds for us. You ready?\u201d\n\u201cReady as I\u2019m going to be.\u201d\n\nAfter Isabella tells you where they are (and you reassure Lisa not to follow you), you\u2019re soon on your way to meet six wizards.\n\nWhen you get to the camp, you make no pretense on being sneaky and fully announce yourself, the Dornans all stand up, save for one of them that looks older than the rest.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want vampire?\u201d one of them with a shitty goatee asks.\n\u201cThat obvious?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cVery. Now, you want to tell us why you\u2019re intruding on our camp or do we make spell components out of your ashes?\u201d\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s with the threats? There are six of you guys and just one of me! I hardly think I\u2019d be able to take all of you on.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right you wouldn\u2019t, you walking leech.\u201d\n\u201cHey, steady there Travis. I know this one!\u201d one of the female members says.\n\nIt\u2019s the same woman who approached you years ago about an alliance.\n\n\u201cYou know this blood sucker, Heather?\u201d Travis asks.\n\u201cYeah, he lives in Holgard. Or as far as I know he still does. He\u2019s not that old and is definitely no threat to us. He\u2019s the one that was approached back when all the faiths were at each other\u2019s throats. You never did get back to us on that offer.\u201d Heather says stepping closer towards you.\n\u201cI figured me never showing up at your temple was my answer. Besides, looks like you guys came out okay without my help.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cIndeed, so where\u2019s your ghoul girl?\u201d\n\u201cAlas, she is no longer with me. Taken down by those accursed Joachimites during those years of strife.\u201d\n\u201cSee? You should have allied with us; such a loss could have been prevented.\u201d\n\u201cProbably for the best. As a vampire I probably should start getting used to the loss of those I once loved. So what are you lot doing out here?\u201d\n\u201cWe could ask the same of you. Even more so since you seem to have evaded Travis\u2019 initial question.\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing interesting. I occasionally leave Holgard to hunt in the wild. I find that it keeps the senses sharp. Besides, the bandit types out here tend to put up more of a fight than the cutpurses in Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cHm, so why approach us?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, Just looking for company to talk to. I get sort of lonely sometimes, especially with Lisa gone. I even tried to make another ghoul once, but\u2026eh, it wasn\u2019t the same and I disposed of it.\u201d\n\u2018Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s a real shame. Poor depressed vampire wallowing about how nobody understands his pain. Boo fucking hoo. Why the hell is it that half of all you vampires are like this? Shit, I got more respect for those leeches that just rip your head off and dispense with all the pretense of trying to be living creatures with real feelings. If you\u2019re really that tortured, just go take a walk in the sun and be done with it.\u201d Travis says dismissively.\n\u201cWhat is with your hostility? I understand your need to be cautious given the circumstances, but you don\u2019t need to act like a complete asshole. I just asked what you guys were doing out here and if you don\u2019t want to tell me, fine I\u2019ll just leave you to it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Travis, he just doesn\u2019t like the outdoors and it\u2019s been making him cranky. If you really want to know though, we\u2019re just investigating magical disturbances around this area.\u201d\n\u201cHeather! Why the fuck would you tell him that?\u201d Travis remarks.\n\u201cYeah, this leech doesn\u2019t need to know our business.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cOh what difference does it really make? Not like he\u2019s got some unholy alliance with Ral. Besides, Elder Flynn would have said something by now, if I did something wrong, isn\u2019t that right Elder Flynn? Elder Flynn? Elder?\u201d\n\nAt this point they all turn towards the old man who is still sitting down and not saying a word.\n\nThen suddenly he slumps forward and his head comes off.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d someone shouts and before any of them can react, Isabella has already opened up the throats of two of them.\n\nYou dodge a bolt of flame and take out another Dornan. Travis, however, speaks some words and a flash of light blinds you long enough to cause him to get away. Meanwhile Heather has already cast a speed spell and completely run off,\n\n\u201cYou get that goatee asshole, I\u2019ll chase down the speed bitch!\u201d Isabella shouts.\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to tell you twice.\n\nWhile Travis can\u2019t out pace you in the long run, he\u2019s smart enough to cast an illusion and you see several versions of him split up and run into different directions and whatever magic he\u2019s using to cause illusions, its also masking him so you can\u2019t tell which one is the real one just by scent.\n\nFortunately for you he\u2019s arrogant enough to not just run away which will at least give you a chance to kill him.\n\nUnfortunately, that also gives him a chance to kill you and you once again narrowly dodge a bolt of magic thrown your way by him (or an illusion) hiding behind one of the many trees.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re taking me down, guess again leech. I\u2019ve destroyed creatures far more threatening than you.\u201d Travis taunts.\n\nYou don\u2019t answer you just try to focus on any and all sounds.\n\nYou stop completely and listen, then you suddenly grab a figure hiding behind a large oak tree and squeeze by the neck.\n\nTravis\u2019 eyes bulge and he gasps, but then at the point where you would have easily crushed his throat, he begins to laugh and the illusion disappears. You then get blasted in the back by a bolt of flame.\n\nYou feel the burn and have to roll on the ground like an idiot putting it out.\n\n\u201cStupid fucking leech! This is going to be so easy!\u201d\n\nIn between your charred clothing and flesh, you do catch another familiar scent. It isn\u2019t Travis\u2019 however.\n\nIt\u2019s Lisa.\n\nYou can only guess she decided to try to help after all and is in the vicinity somewhere.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to her immediately", "result": "While Lisa has gone hunting by herself many times without you around before, this is different since as far as you know she\u2019s never faced an opponent like this before.

A good portion of you is on fire and you desperately try to put it out, while trying to get back into cover.\n\nWhile you were burned, you were still in fighting shape, however when Lisa saw that you were the one in danger so she rushed to YOUR aid rather than staying in hiding.\n\nThat worked out even less well for her than it did for you.

His screams of agony don\u2019t get any longer, and in fact he begins to just stop making much noise at all.\n\n\u201cYeah, looks like the shock and blood loss are kicking in. You\u2019re lucky that Lisa got to you first. If it were up to me, I would have stretched out your torment a lot longer.\u201d\n\nTravis tries to speak, but all he can do is bubble up some blood from his mouth and struggle to stay awake.\n\n\u201cGuess there\u2019s one silver lining in this for you, you\u2019re getting eaten by someone who doesn\u2019t make any pretenses of what she is right? I\u2019m sure she appreciates your respect, along with your flesh.\u201d\n\nLisa finishes chewing through Travis\u2019 right arm and then gives him one good chomp on the side of his neck, which finally kills him, though it doesn\u2019t kill Lisa\u2019s hunger and she continues to feed.\n\n\u201cYou did good Lisa. Thank you.\u201d You say and kiss her on the top of her head which finally allows breaks her attention long enough to briefly nuzzle against your leg before returning to eat.\n\n\u201cI hate to break up your feast, but we have other matters to take care of, come on, let\u2019s head back to the Dornan camp. Hopefully Isabella didn\u2019t kill the other one. Oh, you can bring his arm with you.\u201d\n\nLisa wastes no time in following you back to the camp, though there is still one thing you\u2019re wondering about.\n\n\u201cLisa, how the hell did you single out Travis in all the illusions?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh that was easy. I just sniffed him out.\u201d Lisa answers as a bit of meat flies from her mouth.\n\u201cHow? I couldn\u2019t even get his scent.\u201d\n\u201cYou were right about him being scared. He had pissed himself. Easy to get scent for me after that. I hunt in the sewers all the time, you know. I can usually single out the origins of bodily waste under the right circumstances. It took some time for me to perfect that skill, I\u2019ve always wanted to tell you about it, would you like to hear how\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay Lisa. Maybe another time.\u201d\n\nFunny how you desperately trained yourself to try to block out the various \u201caromas\u201d of the sewers, meanwhile Lisa completely embraced them. Whatever works you guess.\n\nYou soon return to the camp and go through the bodies since Isabella isn\u2019t around. You don\u2019t really find much though, at least not any more that what Heather told you. Having little else to do, you decide to sit and wait, while Lisa eats one of the Dornans.\n\nTime passes a bit and you start to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just go back home. This was more of Isabella\u2019s thing and if she\u2019s not here then you really don\u2019t have strong feelings about getting revenge on Ral. Sure it would be nice, but you\u2019ve had enough of fighting wizards for tonight.\n\nUnfortunately Isabella comes back just as you\u2019re thinking on this, with Heather over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t leave yours alive.\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m afraid Lisa\u2019s hunger took care of that, but I figured you\u2019d show restraint since I was certain you wouldn\u2019t place too much faith in us anyway.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know Lisa was even going to be around since you told her to stay put. In any case I suppose you were correct in thinking that I wouldn\u2019t believe you to have as much restraint, so this one is still alive. Knocked her ass out when I finally caught up with her, so I haven\u2019t gotten any information from her yet. I guess we can do that together at least.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long for Isabella to slap Heather awake. When she sees the two of you hovering over her, she\u2019s obviously very frightened and turns to what most do in a hopeless situation.\n\n\u201cOh please, Dorna give me the knowledge and power to overcome my disadvantageous position. I will make the large sacrifice in your honor if you only lend me your wisdom.\u201d She says and begins praying which Isabella puts a stop to with another slap.\n\u201cOh no, you aren\u2019t mumbling some prayer and casting another spell. The best you can hope for in your situation is if you don\u2019t piss me off and you get a quick death. Now tell me what you know about Ral and what\u2019s going on out here.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t we come to some sort of agreement?\u201d Heather asks.\n\nIsabella looks at you.\n\n\u201cReminds me of you with all these attempts at bargaining.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWell, you gotta admit, it worked for me.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not working for this bitch, now TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU FUCKING KNOW!\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s face becomes that monstrous expression that manages to scare Heather even more than she already is. She starts crying and pleading and ultimately agreeing to tell her everything she knows even though it isn\u2019t much.\n\nHeather explains that none of them really knew what to find out here and it was Elder Flynn who first sensed the magic disturbance. He wasn\u2019t sure at first about checking it out, but after much meditation (And sensing other disturbances) he decided that he needed to confront his old comrade.\n\nApparently the Elder and Ral were old friends when they were young, but obviously had a disagreement in ideology as far as magic. The Elder of course thought it was a Dorna\u2019s most precious gift to the world and thanks must always be given to her for it. Ral on the other hand just believed that it was a force to be mastered like any other and didn\u2019t even acknowledge Dorna.\n\nShe said most knew about Ral since he was a wizard of some power even if he was very reclusive most of the time, but Elder Flynn didn\u2019t speak of him in any detail until recently. Said that his experiments had probably gone too far and he would have to be stopped before Dorna\u2019s wrath was brought upon the world.\n\nEven though the Elder said the disturbances had died down and they hadn\u2019t seen anything unusual yet, he said they still needed to confront Ral since he was dangerous wild card. Heather didn\u2019t speak out, but she got the impression that this meeting was just something the Elder seemed to want more than correcting magical disturbance.\n\n\u201cOh, that was Flynn? Damn, didn\u2019t even recognize him, though I thought there was something vaguely familiar about his scent. If I had recognized him, maybe I would have tried a different approach. Oh well.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWait, you knew the Elder?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cYeah, he and Ral were competing for my attention when they were young! That\u2019s why the friendship broke up. Ideological disagreement my fine undead ass. Flynn wasn\u2019t hooked up in all this Dorna worship shit when I knew him. I mean he was more religious than Ral, but he wasn\u2019t a fanatic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Ral do that won you over?\u201d you ask out of genuine curiosity.\n\u201cHe made me laugh. In any case, I guess that doesn\u2019t help us much, but it was worth a try. Alright, let\u2019s get this done\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWAIT! Please! I\u2019m no threat anymore! I didn\u2019t even want to fight you guys! You! When we met, wasn\u2019t I reasonable to you?\u201d Heather exclaims, trying to appeal to you.\n\u201cWhen we first met, you fucking did some sort of charm on Lisa to make her docile.\u201d you say.\n\u201cBut\u2026please! (sob) I don\u2019t wanna die! I didn\u2019t even want to come out here! (sob) Wait! I know! Make me into a vampire! I mean I could be a good one! I\u2019m already a night owl and I could make a good apprentice! Please, I just don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Heather is groveling completely at Isabella\u2019s feet. This is such a pathetic display, you\u2019re sort of feeling a bit for the girl.\n\n\u201cIsabella, maybe you could make her into a vampire? I mean she probably could help you quite a bit on building a new home, what with being a sorceress and all.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHello, my name is Isabella, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m not turning this bitch into a vampire just because she\u2019s begging for her life. I have standards. I only turn those that are mate potential into vampires.\u201d Isabella sniffs.\n\u201cDo you HAVE to have sex with the person you turn into a vampire?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and as I think you know I\u2019m not into women.\u201d\n\u201cJust pretend you\u2019re in college.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, my dad said a lot of girls at his university used to do that and then got married to some guy anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no. Look, if you\u2019re so keen on saving this human, then you could always turn her into a ghoul.\u201d\n\nLisa looks up long enough from the corpse she\u2019s eating to give an angry growl at that suggestion. Lisa might be willing to serve you unquestioningly, but she still wants to be the only ghoul in your life, not that you were considering it anyway.\n\n\u201cToo bad Heather, hope your afterlife with Dorna is a pleasant one.\u201d You say and without another word Isabella kills Heather.\n\nIsabella feeds and then you do likewise. The three of you then continue your journey to Ral\u2019s home.\n\nAlong the way you start noticing discoloration of the trees and odd-looking plant life. Some of them even look carnivorous, but you guess they don\u2019t like the taste of undead flesh so they don\u2019t attack. (And Lisa must not be very appetizing either)\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like it belongs here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure doesn\u2019t. What the hell did Ral do?\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cGiven all this change and how the Dornans said it dying down, maybe he\u2019s not even alive anymore.\u201d\n\u201cFor his sake, he better not be.\u201d\n\nAfter passing a few more landscape oddities, you at last reach Ral\u2019s home and it looks about the same as you last saw it. There aren\u2019t any creatures or anything wandering about, though you\u2019re not getting a sense of complete safety either.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s all yours. See if you can\u2019t get in.\u201d Isabella says.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything other than to tell Lisa to stay put and you\u2019ll be back in a moment.\n\nYou approach Ral\u2019s home and try the front door. It\u2019s locked of course, so you pull out a lockpick and easily open it. You step forward\u2026\n\nAnd nothing happens. You apparently are allowed in the house. Now to see if Isabella\u2019s other idea will work.\n\nYou stand in the doorway and motion Lisa and Isabella over. Lisa easily enters the house since she wasn\u2019t barred by strange rules anyway. Isabella however, still can\u2019t get in.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d She remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, I thought you said you were always welcome in a place that was my home.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEh, more weird rules. This place, while you were welcomed in here, still officially isn\u2019t your home, it\u2019s Ral\u2019s. I figured it was a long shot. I\u2019m going to try to figure out something out here, in the meantime you need to find out what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d rather you not kill Ral and leave him for me, but if you have to, I\u2019ll certainly understand.\u201d\n\nIsabella takes her leave and you and Lisa are left in a very dusty living area. Looks like this place went to pot after you weren\u2019t around to clean it anymore.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s take this slow I guess. Lisa, you stay very close to me.\u201d You say and begin exploring rooms methodically.\n\nThe eerie thing about all this, is you aren\u2019t hearing any noise whatsoever. Usually you used to at least hear faint noises sometimes from his lab, but there is nothing. Speaking of his lab you eventually decide you might as well just search that place now.\n\nYou make your way there and immediately notice something wrong. The door is open. That door was always locked.\n\nYou cautiously peek inside Ral\u2019s lab for the first time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a complete wreck. There is equipment everywhere; you know Ral wouldn\u2019t have left it like this if he could help it.\n\nExcept he can\u2019t help it, because he\u2019s currently on the floor with a broken neck. He looks like he\u2019s been dead awhile. And then you see another familiar face. Tych.\n\nYou see him flying around between various large tomes and mixing something on one of the only clean lab workbenches.\n\nThis all seems a bit strange, but in any case Tych hasn\u2019t noticed you yet.", "action_results": [{"action": "Call out to him", "result": "There really is no need to be so physical in this situation, so you call out.\n\n\u201cHey Tych!\u201d you shout.\n\nHe spins around and immediately flies upward so he\u2019s safe.\n\n\u201cYou? What are you doing here? Thought you died a long time ago.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI did, I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, well that was one way of breaking the geas I suppose. I\u2019m guessing it was Isabella that provided that option, is she here?\n\nRal might be dead, but you still don\u2019t know what the hell is going on here and Tych isn\u2019t exactly a beacon of trustworthiness himself. For all you know he\u2019s caused all this, you figure you better keep the real story a little hazy.\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen Isabella in years. I sort of broke it off with her when I realized Lisa here was a my true love.\u201d You say and put your arm around her, which she of course doesn\u2019t mind, though she also seems interested in Ral\u2019s corpse.\n\u201cSurprised she allowed you to leave so easily.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cEh, wasn\u2019t exactly easy. In fact, it was sort of a lopsided relationship to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cMm, sounds like Isabella.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize you knew so much about her actually.\u201d\n\u201cRal spoke about her quite a bit. Used to always go on about how he wished things had ended better with her. Talked about her so much that I felt like I knew the woman even though I\u2019d never even seen her.\u201d\n\u201cI see, so\u2026what exactly happened here?\u201d\n\nTych shakes his head.\n\n\u201cA complete failure, that\u2019s what happened. A few months ago Ral was trying to cast some spell he had been working on for years and it backfired spectacularly. He was experimenting with portals that could transport you anywhere in the world. Unfortunately what happened instead is he created a very unstable one and that\u2019s when the rock creature appeared in the middle of the lab and started smashing up the place. Ral barely managed to get off a couple spells before the thing smashed him in the head and disappeared as quickly as it showed up. It was during this time, my jar got smashed.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you escape?\u201d\n\u201cI would have but I heard some rumbling outside along with other noises, so I thought Ral\u2019s spell had a ripple effect on the outside area. I still haven\u2019t left this house for fear of what might be out there. How severe is the damage?\u201d\n\u201cSome weird landscape changes, some odd monsters popping up in places they shouldn\u2019t be, but that\u2019s about all I know. I was in Holgard and it didn\u2019t reach that far. In fact I think the effects of the spell are dying out.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? I would have thought with all the chaos here and the time Ral spent on the spell, it had catastrophic effects of great magnitude. Damn, I feel like a cowardly fool, but being in the hub of it all I guess made me afraid. My long-term captivity also kept me here. Just got comfortable being safe I guess. So Holgard huh? I guess that brings me to my question of why you\u2019re here, if the effects didn\u2019t reach there.\u201d\n\nYou pause a very brief moment as you come up with your lie without much problem.\n\n\u201cOh that was me being a victim of circumstance again. There was a war between the religious factions in Holgard a few years ago and at the time it was mutually beneficial to ally with the Dornans. The war has long since been over, but I still had a deal with them to help when I could and a group of them wanted to explore the magical disturbances their elder sensed in this area. I think they\u2019re the only ones who knew or cared.\u201d\n\u201cOh? So are they with you?\u201d\n\u201cNah, they\u2019re all dead. Got killed by a medusa and her pet basilisks. Just one example of creatures not native to the area popping up.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Just wondering because Ral mentioned him a few times in the past\u2026but was there an Elder Flynn with you in all this?\u201d\n\nYou weren\u2019t sure before, but you\u2019re starting to get a strange feeling about this conversation, however you continue to speak as normal.\n\n\u201cYeah, he was there, but I never spoke much with the man. Always seemed to be pretty serious and save for a few basic directions. I understood him to be a man of great magic ability, but that didn\u2019t mean much when the medusa surprised him and the inevitable happened.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cHm, I see. Hard to believe he was taken out so easily after what Ral told me about him.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy battle to survive. Honestly, Lisa and I almost went home after that. However, by that time I came all this way so I figured I might as well try to learn what happened here and the only person I could think of that might shed some light is Ral.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be met with hostility for escaping?\u201d\n\u201cEh, in all the time I knew him even as his unwilling lackey, he wasn\u2019t excessively cruel or even one to hold that much of a grudge. I sort of figured he wrote me off as dead years ago and moved on. Plus I figured as a vampire I\u2019d at least be on somewhat of an equal footing that he wouldn\u2019t try anything as long as I didn\u2019t act in a threatening manner.\u201d\n\nTych nods a bit.\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right on that account. Ral was a lot of things, but he was never petty. Well that\u2019s about the only information I have for you. I\u2019m actually glad you came by however, since I now know that it isn\u2019t a cataclysm out there. I\u2019ll probably be leaving a lot sooner now.\u201d\n\u201cI bet your wife misses you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHuh? Oh yes my wife\u2026I\u2019d be surprised if she hasn\u2019t moved on already. Though I wouldn\u2019t blame her if she had I suppose. I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think during my time here and while Ral certainly kept me imprisoned, I have to admit I wasn\u2019t exactly innocent. I dunno, maybe my captivity was punishment for all my misdeeds in the past. My apologies for my wrongs against you as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell other than calling me a plivik and lying to me, you didn\u2019t really do any direct damage. Long time ago and literally another life. Anyway, I suppose we\u2019ll be going. Hey Lisa, get away from that body, we\u2019ll find you someone to eat on the way home.\u201d You say motioning Lisa to come with you instead of sniffing around Ral\u2019s corpse.\n\nTych waves goodbye and you soon exit the home. After looking around a bit, you find Isabella digging around the house. It looks like she\u2019s trying to destroy the foundation in an attempt to just destroy the house.\n\n\u201cYou know it would probably be much easier to just set the place on fire.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cProbably, but I don\u2019t exactly have a torch handy at the moment. So, you\u2019re back out here and none the worse for wear. I assume you have news? Did Ral send you out here to an attempt to beg for his life?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cRal\u2019s dead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose he isn\u2019t completely dead.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s either dead or he isn\u2019t! Wait, shit, he\u2019s not a lich is he?!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sprite.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! Okay, you need to explain!\u201d Isabella exclaims.\n\nYou try to collect your thoughts on everything that transpired during your conversation before explaining to her your whole conversation.\n\n\u201cI mean I don\u2019t know for certain, but I REALLY think Ral\u2019s in the body of a sprite slave he once had. That sprite\u2019s name was Tych and he didn\u2019t sound anything like the person that I knew. I mean I know a lot of time has passed, but I just got a very real feeling that I was talking with Ral and not Tych.\u201d You explain.\n\u201cWell did you see Ral\u2019s body anywhere?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cOh yeah, he was on the floor with his neck broken. Looked like he had been dead for a while. Tych, or Ral rather said he met his fate by some strange rock creature.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm\u2026wait\u2026yeah. Your belief has merit. I mean I can\u2019t enter the house still, while you can. If Ral was dead, I would have been able to enter with no problems. How the hell did he get into the body of a sprite?!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I didn\u2019t ask since I was trying to pretend that I believed him to be Tych and I did that because I also have no reason to disbelieve that he isn\u2019t still a powerful wizard. Not sure if he believed if I believed him, but it got me out unscathed.\u201d\n\nIsabella is silent for a moment and then throws a handful of dirt to the ground while stepping out of the large hole she has been digging.\n\n\u201cAh fuck it. I\u2019m done.\u201d She says.\n\u201cWhat, seriously? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not complaining, but you seemed pretty intent on all this revenge before.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah. I honestly can\u2019t be bothered now. I mean if you\u2019re wrong and that\u2019s not Ral at all, it\u2019s hardly worth going to all the trouble to bring down a house just to kill a sprite especially since I don\u2019t even like their blood. And if it is Ral, I can\u2019t even torture him like I want in his new sprite body. I mean yeah I could still do it, but it just wouldn\u2019t be the same. I suppose a part of me was just looking for an excuse to see you again. Shit, I think a small part of me just wanted to see Ral again too. It\u2019s funny that you made up your story about getting lonely to the Dornans, but the reality is, it really does happen. Even to those that are normally fine with isolation like me.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re centuries old, surely you must have known other people.\u201d\n\u201cSure, and most of them are dead, either naturally or otherwise. Hell, I might have even made a reconnection with Flynn had I known it was him. I managed to ignore the prolonged isolation I think for so long because I had a nice home I made for myself. The garden kept me busy too. Now I don\u2019t even have that and while I\u2019m no stranger to having to start completely over it isn\u2019t the most fun thing to do.\u201d\n\nYou start get a little worried about where this might be leading.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not taking your home. Living right next to a sewer isn\u2019t exactly my taste. Besides, you and Lisa are happy there and as I said, I\u2019ve always been a bit of a romantic even if it never quite works out for me.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just knock on the door and call out to Ral? He might be willing to talk.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNice idea, but no. We\u2019re not going to rekindle anything especially with him stuck in the body of a fucking sprite now. Besides it isn\u2019t like I\u2019m still not mad at him for destroying my home even if it was an accident. No, I think maybe it\u2019s time for me to move on from this area altogether. Maybe the Delantium Kingdom, or at least pass through there. There are maybe at least one or two folks I know living in that area, maybe they\u2019re still interesting. Anything\u2019s possible right?\u201d\n\u201cSeems like it. If you asked me when I was a teenager where I\u2019d be at thirty, it wouldn\u2019t be assaulting a wizard\u2019s home as a vampire with another vampire and ghoul by my side. My answer would have been probably still robbing travelling merchants with my twin sister in my hometown. Still think about her and the rest of the family sometimes and wonder how they\u2019re doing, but that\u2019s all a past life.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t write off the past completely, it usually has a way of sneaking up on you even when you\u2019re not a mortal. I mean it certainly did recently for you. Well, thank you for your help, you truly are free now. You take care okay? And take care of Lisa too. You make a lovely couple.\u201d\n\nWith those last words, Isabella briefly moves forward a bit, perhaps to make physical contact with you, but stops herself. She instead turns away and walks off into the forest. You soon lose sight of her and it\u2019s just you and Lisa.\n\n\u201cIs she gone for good?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cYeah I think she is.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood, it\u2019s just you and me again. Just like it always should be!\u201d\n\u201cYes it is, come on let\u2019s go back home.\u201d\n\nPart of you wonders if you were really correct about Tych actually being Ral and what exactly happened. You suppose you\u2019ll never know the entire story, and actually you\u2019re fine with that.\n\nThis has been a very strange past couple of days. Surreal even. You were forced into this quest for revenge and there was even an unrelated struggle before you reached your destination, then when you finally reached that destination, it was sort of an anti-climatic conclusion.\n\nYou suppose that\u2019s just how shit happens sometimes.

I mean sure I don\u2019t have any love for Ral, but unless the man is coming to magically enslave me again, I just really don\u2019t feel the need to go looking for trouble. I moved on and made a new life for myself and I\u2019m happy with it. I dunno Isabella, maybe you should do the same.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s face is noticeably annoyed by your remark, but she doesn\u2019t threaten you or anything, just more of an expression of exasperation and disappointment.\n\n\u201cVery well, but I didn\u2019t think that you were the type to run and hide when opportunity presented itself.

Despite her sneering words at you, you can\u2019t help but notice her glancing at you leave with a bit of melancholy in her eyes. Maybe she was hoping to rekindle something that wasn\u2019t there in the first place. Who knows? She never really did open up to you even in all those years you were forced to be together, maybe if she had, things would have been different like she thought they would be.\n\nYou\u2019re about to head back to the meat room, when you notice blood puddles and small trails in the hallway.

In fact me and you are leaving together.\u201d\n\u201cWe are? Where are we going?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure honestly, but we\u2019re not going to be living here anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Are we being kicked out?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking yes. But I\u2019d rather us have to start all over again and be free, than have to be a servant again. So, we\u2019ll be hitting the road so to speak. You have anywhere in mind that you\u2019d like to go?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026I dunno\u2026I\u2019ve never been anywhere other than here and Dert.\u201d\n\u201cTrue I suppose. But I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d heard of any place you might like to go\u2026though I suppose you don\u2019t bother making conversation with too many people.\u201d\n\nLisa looks introspective for a moment and then speaks again.\n\n\u201cThe Delantium Kingdom?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t know you had any interest to go there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOne time, I stumbled upon a fancy dressed man in the sewers who was from the Delantium Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cHe told you that?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, he claimed that he was a very important man there and if I killed him, people would come looking for him and seek revenge. Of course I didn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t suppose you know what such an important man was doing in the sewers do you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I dunno what he was doing in the sewers, maybe he was lost, but in any event he tasted better than anyone from Holgard.\u201d\n\nYou smile a bit at Lisa\u2019s reasons for suggesting the Delantium Kingdom. A very simple pleasure of food and the possibility of it tasting better there. It\u2019s as good of a reason as any you suppose, since you don\u2019t have many ideas at the moment.\n\n\u201cOkay, then if you want to go to the Delantium Kingdom then that\u2019s where we\u2019ll go to start over. It\u2019s going to be a long way, so maybe we should take a ship rather than travelling over land.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOhh, I\u2019ve never been on a ship before!\u201d Lisa exclaims.\n\u201cNeither have I, so it\u2019ll be a new experience for the pair of us. I of course also imagine we\u2019ll have to stowaway on a ship heading there, but that shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Even hiding aboard the vessel shouldn\u2019t pose too much of a challenge.\u201d\n\u201cI might get hungry though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will too, but I\u2019m confident that they\u2019ll be able to afford losing a few crew members without arousing too much suspicion. If it starts getting risky, you can always feed on me a little more and I\u2019ll worry about getting sustenance so that I can keep both of our strength up.\u201d\n\nLisa displays a big smile at that idea. Anything that allows her to suck on you more than usual is always a good thing in her eyes. With a hug and a kiss, Lisa is once again happy since she knows that Isabella isn\u2019t threatening her position anymore. (Not that she was in the first place)\n\nYou don\u2019t bother taking much with you, save for a few of your old thief tools and that\u2019s mainly for sentimental value, as you don\u2019t really do much of that sort of thing anymore. But things change, just like they are right now and just like how they probably will in the future.\n\nYou and Lisa sneak aboard a trading vessel carrying a lot of cargo. Makes hiding in the bowels of the ship a lot easier with all the crates and boxes around. Occasionally one of you leaves the confines of one of the crates to feed, but mostly the pair of you just lie next to each other and enjoying each other\u2019s company as you wait to reach your destination.\n\nYour days as a common rogue might be over, but you remain positive that your best days as a vampire have yet to be realized and hopefully those are coming soon.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Leave Lisa behind", "result": "Isabella was right.

However, in her current form she allowed you to regain your freedom so you\u2019ll always remember her for that, along with when she was human.\n\nYou think about killing her now, and it\u2019s not really because you wouldn\u2019t do so, if only to release her from this hellish state of life, but you\u2019ve still got one last idea to stick it to Isabella for putting you in this situation to begin with.\n\n\u201cLisa, you remember your old home Dert and how to get there correct?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yes! I remember it well! It\u2019s full of humans! Fleshy\u2026delicious human\u2026\u201d Lisa starts to say trailing off as she thinks of exactly that.\n\u201cYes, it is.

A LONG while.\n\nStill, no point in not giving the girl one last thrill.\n\nYou quickly open up your wrist and motion Lisa to drink, which she does so gladly. You give her a little more than usual since you figure she\u2019s going to need the extra strength to take on an entire village. Even assuming she survives that, she still will be no match for Isabella who will no doubt eventually learn of this, but at least you\u2019ve given Lisa a nice going away present.\n\nAfterwards you pat Lisa on the head and tell her to scamper off before all the humans in Dert get away. With this last command you watch Lisa lope into the darkness towards Dert. Isabella\u2019s going to be pissed. You half wonder if she\u2019ll hunt you down for doing this, but for some reason you don\u2019t really care if she does. You just sort of wish you could figure out a way to get a little revenge on that asshole Ral too, but that might be for a different day you guess.\n\nYou briefly think about making your way to Holgard since it is the closest settlement of where you can feed easily, but you figure you probably should just leave the region entirely. Not to mention being a \u201cnormal\u201d thief just doesn\u2019t hold the same thrill it once did and it\u2019s not even necessary anymore.\n\nYou\u2019ve never been a wanderer by nature, but maybe you\u2019ll start to become one now. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even bump into your sister in your travels. You like to think that she\u2019d find your transformation very interesting, or at least the story of how it happened.

Would she even want to become a vampire for that matter?\n\nThe thing is, you don\u2019t even really know. As the years have gone by, you realize that you didn\u2019t know her excessively well. You had some good times with her and she was a distraction from being under Ral\u2019s thumb, but did you really love her?\n\nNo. You were just hanging on to a memory of the past and in her current trance state, that memory continues to fade as you watch her get older and continue to behave like some emotionless golem.\n\nThe real Lisa wanted to live an adventure. This isn\u2019t an adventure and this isn\u2019t life.\n\nIsabella\u2019s right, you do have more in common with her. Arguably, you even know her better despite the fact that Isabella still hasn\u2019t really told you much about her own past (which must be extensive).\n\nThis realization still causes you to feel sadness. You really thought that if you just hung on to Lisa, that maybe your situation would work itself out, but it isn\u2019t. This is your life or unlife as it were.\n\nYou put your face in your hands and try not to weep, but you fail.

You\u2019re not happy here and you never will be. You\u2019re also always going to be resentful towards me on some level. Guess I should have known, but spending decades being detached from humanity sort of makes one become less aware of certain social niceties.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Lisa?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, her. Well I\u2019m sure you do realize that she still can\u2019t leave here. Can\u2019t do anything about that.

Just go.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nYou give one last look at Lisa and briefly think about giving her a goodbye hug or even a kiss, but it would be a meaningless gesture to someone who is in no state of mind to appreciate it anyway. And even if she were, she most likely wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with you.\n\nYou take your leave of Isabella\u2019s home and don\u2019t look back. (Fortunately it\u2019s night time right now)\n\nAs sad as you are about what happened with Lisa, you now feel a great weight lifted off of you. Namely the ball and chain of slavery. First Ral and then Isabella. For the first time since you left your home, you\u2019re actually free. Truly free. It\u2019s a little surreal.\n\nSince you\u2019re lacking in any other ideas at the moment and need some time to think, you head to the closest place that you can think of where you can find reasonable dwellings and can feed easily, Holgard.\n\nWhen you arrive, you head to the graveyard. Many times in your past visits to Holgard, you\u2019ve found temporary places to stay any time you got stuck here before the sunrise. While it probably would be just as easy to stay at an inn, you suppose your years with Isabella have caused you to appreciate the solitude of a crypt.\n\nYou find yourself an older one that doesn\u2019t look like it gets too much visitation and after a few adjustments, you make a space for yourself.\n\nWhat will you do with yourself now? What DO vampires do to pass the time? It can\u2019t all just be drinking blood obviously. Isabella had her garden (and cleaning until you showed up) Your concerns aren\u2019t so much in the present you suppose, but the future since you\u2019ve got a long one ahead of you.\n\nYour previous profession of thievery seems all rather pointless now. You don\u2019t need money to live anymore and you don\u2019t even get that much of a thrill out of it like you once did, of course most of your roguish skills were being used to steal for Lisa, so it hasn\u2019t been for your original reasons for a long time anyway.\n\nAll of this also has had you wondering how your family is doing, and if they\u2019re all okay. You imagine your parents really wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with you now, so there\u2019s no point in visiting them even you weren\u2019t facing mob justice there (And as a vampire, you can\u2019t imagine the folks in Teckleville would be any friendlier towards you, though you suppose you\u2019d be able to handle them easier now).\n\nYou like to think your sister would still speak with you though. She\u2019d probably find it all very fascinating, which you suppose it is in some ways.\n\nFor a while you think you can go back to your \u201cold life.\u201d Pick up where you left off, or rather what you originally wanted to do in the first place after you left Teckleville.\n\nThis works, but only temporarily.\n\nPart of you would stay in Holgard and just go about a simple existence of feeding on unlucky souls and possibly burglarizing a store just to pass the time. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re exactly unhappy doing that, but after a few months you realize it isn\u2019t so much the monotony of your life that\u2019s bothering you, but rather the area.\n\nFirst, Holgard is currently undergoing a \u201choly war\u201d of sorts between its various religious factions. While it\u2019s making things chaotic enough for you go unnoticed, you can\u2019t help but get a little concerned when the Church of Joachim starts talking about forming groups to hunt down evil supernatural elements that are corrupting the city as part of their crusade to prove they are what\u2019s best for Holgard.\n\nSecond (and somewhat more importantly) Holgard used to be a sort of \u201cescape\u201d from Ral and later Isabella. You used to be able to put it out of your mind that you were under someone else\u2019s command for a little while.\n\nNow? Holgard just feels like you haven\u2019t \u201cmoved on\u201d from your shackles. Or at least not moved on enough. While you\u2019ve never been a wanderer like your sister and maybe it\u2019s a combination of your previous experiences, along with being a vampire, but you feel the urge to travel. You don\u2019t know where, but you have to get out of this city. Maybe even find something else to do.\n\nHolgard always has trade ships leaving its harbor going to various locations. You sneak aboard one in the middle of night and hide yourself in one of them. You think this one is going to the Delantium Kingdom, but it might be going to some place you\u2019ve never heard of, you don\u2019t really care as long as you\u2019re away from this area.\n\nNever been aboard a ship before, so this will be a new experience too. You imagine you\u2019ll get hungry on the journey, but as far as you know there\u2019s enough crew on the ship that you\u2019ll be able to get by. Just have to be stealthy about it, but then that isn\u2019t really a problem anymore.\n\nYou still don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re going to do with the rest of your undead life, but your days as a common rogue are over.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Focus on Lisa", "result": "You made one deal with a powerful being and it didn\u2019t go well.

I dunno\u2026I mean I want to leave Dert, but I\u2019m not sure if I have it in me to do what you do.\u201d\n\u201cSure you do. Look, just think about everything I said.

If we get to Holgard and decide you don\u2019t want to do what I do, I\u2019m sure we can find something else. My point is, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to be free of Ral\u2019s spell, but I can at least help you achieve your goals in my limited way because I really do love you.\u201d\n\nWell nothing like going all in even if you aren\u2019t entirely sure\u2026\n\nOf course now that you\u2019ve said this to Lisa she\u2019s so touched by your crossing that final line of feelings, she immediately hugs and kisses you and probably also ready to go all in with travelling to Holgard even if she was still nervous about it.\n\nOf course now YOU\u2019RE nervous about all this!\n\nYou return to Ral\u2019s gathering up most of your money stash. You didn\u2019t really realize just how much you had managed to acquire. Even spending it on whores and carousing didn\u2019t really put as much of a dent in it as you thought. Which is good since you\u2019d prefer to put Lisa up some place that isn\u2019t a complete shithole when you get to Holgard.\n\nBesides the place being a city of cutthroats and thieves, you\u2019re more concerned about the rising tensions going on there. There is the very real danger of a revolution of sorts going on there, but that will have to be something to deal with when it happens.\n\nYou half expect Ral to suddenly ask you to go perform some risky task, but he doesn\u2019t. In fact Ral hasn\u2019t asked you to do anything lately, he hasn\u2019t even been on your ass about cleaning his home or fetching roots or flowers for whatever reason. He\u2019s been locked in his lab for a couple weeks at least now, which is fine by you since that gives you a bit of time to get Lisa settled in Holgard.\n\nThe next day you meet up with Lisa who is definitely ready to go. She seems much more confidant about this than she was yesterday.\n\nShe\u2019s a little worried about getting accosted on the way to Holgard, due to the stories she\u2019s heard about bandits, and to be honest you are too given how much money you\u2019re travelling with along with a pretty young girl, but you surprisingly never encounter a single soul.\n\nWhen you finally reach Holgard, you end up having to bribe a guard a hefty sum just so he doesn\u2019t fuck with you both, so you pretty much get robbed anyway. It\u2019s still not too bad and you have more than enough to set up Lisa at some place to stay.\n\nLisa is overwhelmed by the size of Holgard and she looks like a clueless berk as she looks around at every little thing. Many times you have to keep a close eye on her, just to make sure she doesn\u2019t wander too far and get herself kidnapped or something similar.\n\nEventually you make it to a place called the Sterling Silver. It\u2019s one of the better inns that isn\u2019t a complete criminal haven and still some place that you\u2019re currently able to afford.\n\nAfter getting a bit settled, Lisa\u2019s still eager to explore the city, though you really have to sit her down and stress the danger of this place.\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019ve told me all this before in your past tales to me and on the journey here. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were, but whether you want to hear it or not, you\u2019re out of your element and you need know how to survive here. I don\u2019t mind telling you I\u2019m going to be severely worried about you all the time now. (Sigh) Well let\u2019s get started.\u201d\n\nYou spend the next two days attempting to teach Lisa the basics of thievery. She\u2019s not exactly a natural at it, but fortunately there are so many thieves in the city, you\u2019re never in serious trouble with the law as soon as you both manage to run immediately from the area.\n\nThough you\u2019re more concerned with your activity calling attention to the Thieves\u2019 Guild or worse, the Ebony Claw Syndicate. You\u2019ve been fortunate enough to avoid their attention, but Lisa\u2019s clumsy attempts might start doing that.\n\nAnd of course the bigger problem is you\u2019re not exactly going to be around to hold Lisa\u2019s hand all the time, since even if Ral isn\u2019t sending you on some forsaken mission, you still have return there just so you aren\u2019t suffering from the geas affects.\n\nLisa keeps trying to reassure you that she\u2019ll be fine, but you feel better leaving her your flintlock just so she isn\u2019t completely defenseless.\n\nLacking any more to do, you take your leave and can only hope she doesn\u2019t get killed or worse on her first night alone in this place.\n\nYou return to Ral\u2019s in a few days and it\u2019s the same thing, he\u2019s still locked in his lab. It would be too much to hope that he\u2019s dead, but you can still hear faint sounds on the other side of the lab door.\n\nYou go to sleep and then as soon as you wake up, you immediately head back to Holgard again. When you arrive this time, you have to wait around for Lisa since she isn\u2019t at her room. Eventually she shows up and you\u2019re hugging her as soon as she walks in the door of the inn. She\u2019s happy to see you too, but keeps telling you not to worry so much about her.\n\nThis routine goes on for weeks, you arrive in Holgard, are relieved to see Lisa\u2019s still alive, try to teach her the art of thievery and then head back to Ral\u2019s. Occasionally it\u2019s broken up by Ral leaving notes telling you to grab various ingrediants for him and just leaving them by the lab door.\n\nIn the meantime, the situation in Holgard is getting worse. The Baron\u2019s guards have been executing dissidents in the streets and there are rumors that the folks behind this dissident movement aren\u2019t much better than the fat ass who runs this city, but then that\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\nThe Ebony Claws and the Thieves\u2019 Guild have also been engaging in direct confrontation with each other.\n\nStrangely despite all this, Lisa isn\u2019t exactly concerned. Another week passes and you come to understand why.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been just flat out mugging people?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cMostly.\u201d She says.\n\u201cWha\u2026when?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a month ago when I realized I\u2019m rubbish at the whole sneaking about thing. Look, I know it\u2019s something you\u2019re good at, but it\u2019s just not me. I really tried several times, but I kept messing up and nearly getting myself killed in the process. In fact it was when one of the shopkeepers actually caught me and I was forced to pull out the flintlock to stop him from doing any harm to me. Since I had him at my mercy, I just robbed him at gunpoint while I was at it. Then I realized, I should have been doing that to begin with.\u201d\n\nYou have to say, while you knew Lisa was attracted to the bad, you didn\u2019t expect her to go this route. No wonder she isn\u2019t worried about the current state of the city.\n\n\u201c\u2026why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, because you seemed so happy trying to teach me about what you do. Besides, some of it I still use. Lock picking is always handy. You seem upset, are you disappointed I\u2019m not doing what you do?\u201d\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t care about that so much that I\u2019m really concerned that your actions might start attracting attention and I don\u2019t mean the guards. You could very well be robbing merchants or people under the protection of the ECS and if they find out, it\u2019s not going to be good. I\u2019d wager the only reason why you\u2019re getting away with it is because you\u2019ve been lucky with your targets or the ECS is so caught up in their own shit with the Guild that they\u2019re in conflict with.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe I should join the ECS, then it won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d\n\nYou have no words. Well you do, it\u2019s just it takes you awhile to gather them.\n\n\u201cHave you gone completely barmy?! Even I wouldn\u2019t join the ECS! They\u2019re a group of utterly ruthless killers and don\u2019t tolerate fuck ups. I mean sure I\u2019m not exactly in a position of casting moral judgment, but they\u2019re just fucking cruel. Not to mention, I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019re all caught up in Fel worship, making them religious fanatics on top of everything else. I\u2019d join the Guild before them, and I wouldn\u2019t join the Guild mainly because I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019re not going to be around much longer.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cWell I guess I\u2019m just going to have to be more careful. You need to relax, you\u2019re all tense. You come to me and I\u2019ll make it better.\u201d\n\nAt this point Lisa starts making overtures of affection. You\u2019re not exactly in the mood due to your worry, but Lisa soon gets you in the mood with enough effort. It\u2019s at least enough to put it out of your mind for awhile.\n\nWhen you leave Lisa this time, you take solace in the fact that she at least has learned how to survive in her own way and it didn\u2019t involve whoring.\n\nHowever, when you return to Ral\u2019s this time, you\u2019ve got new concerns. Ral is actually waiting for you.\n\n\u201cFinally back. Glad to see you adhere to the bare minimum of what is required of you.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, is you\u2019re not around nearly as much as you should be. I know you think because I\u2019m locked away in my lab most of the time that that means you can just do whatever, but I remind you that you\u2019re supposed to be upkeeping this place. Look at all this dust!\u201d\n\u201cApologies, but you didn\u2019t say anything about that on your notes to me.\u201d\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t NEED to tell you! And I also shouldn\u2019t have to be leaving notes for you in the first place! It\u2019s fucking inconvenient. If I wasn\u2019t actually busy with something really important I\u2019d just make your tether even shorter, but I can see that\u2019s not really going to solve the issue. You\u2019re obviously pre-occupied with something else with as much time as you\u2019ve been spending away from here. Let me guess, a girl?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) If I was a vindictive sort, I suppose I could do all sorts of things to cause you pain, but there\u2019s really no good reason for that and I can see that our own relationship has hit a wall with this new development. So I\u2019m going to offer you another deal. I\u2019ll release the geas after you go on one last mission for me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard correctly. One more mission and then you get your freedom. I trust this sounds good to you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! I mean there\u2019s no catch is there? Like I\u2019m free, but I have the head of a chicken and goat legs or something right?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! You sure have a funny imagination. But no, once you do this mission, you\u2019ll be completely free to live your life and you\u2019ll never have to deal with me ever again.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! So what needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cI need you to bring back the heart of a Wazia.\u201d\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t they live in the Cloudpeak Mountains?\u201d\n\u201cYes, they also eat trolls and manticores.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m no warrior! You know that! That\u2019s suicide!\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sending Tych with you, he can help.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Tych going to do, sparkle in its face?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you\u2019ll have to work it out with him on various tactics to employ.\u201d\n\u201cThe Cloudpeak Mountains are also practically on the other side of the continent! Are you going to teleport me there like last time?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, and I\u2019m going to personally equip you for this assignment, so no need to worry about getting winter gear or whatever else you need for the cold. In fact, the cold won\u2019t even be an issue at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat better be one warm coat.\u201d\n\u201cOh you won\u2019t ever need a coat again, after what I\u2019m going to do. Stand still.\u201d\n\nBefore you even get a \u201cwha\u2026\u201d out Ral taps you in the head and you\u2019re instantly paralyzed and fall to the floor. You don\u2019t even feel pain, you don\u2019t feel anything at all actually.\n\n\u201cNow, I need to start on your transformation\u2026where did I put my stiletto again\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know what Ral is doing to you. You don\u2019t even know how much time passes. You aren\u2019t even really aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a trance and everything has gone blank in your mind.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 23\n\n\u201cHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d you gasp as you suddenly sit up from a table.\n\nCold air emanates from your mouth though you don\u2019t feel very cold. You don\u2019t feel much of anything except a mild sense of panic and confusion. You briefly look at body which is completely naked and see that you are now a pale blue coloring.\n\nYou look around the room and see a lot of lab equipment, books, and other alchemy related items. Ral stands by watching you. Tych is also hovering near him dressed in who looks to be very tiny winter clothing for him.\n\n\u201cSee, told you he\u2019d survive.\u201d Ral remarks and then makes a note on a piece of parchment.\n\u201cOh joy, I get to go with him now.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME?!\u201d you shout. You\u2019d probably get up and attack Ral, but apparently the geas is still in effect.\n\nRal strokes his beard and frowns a bit before answering you.\n\n\u201cWell I made you better for one thing. You don\u2019t have to ever worry about the cold ever again.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t fucking feel anything! Everything is a numb sensation!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes, I thought that might happen. A minor drawback I assure you. You are now practically cold personified. Your body now magically produces cold around you. Even I can feel it from here. Seriously, you could stand naked on top of the Cloudpeak Mountains now and never freeze to death. You\u2019ll also find that you\u2019re a little slower than you were, though you\u2019re also probably a little stronger as well so it all evens out. Unexpected side effect. In any case, we should probably get you ready for your task. As ready as you are, I doubt you want to go naked.\u201d\n\nYou might not be able to do anything against Ral, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from getting pissed and start yelling at him about your situation. When he mentions more than a year has passed, you even start to destroy his equipment until he stops you with some sort of hold spell.\n\nAfter a few more warnings about you continuing to getting an attitude with him, Ral finally gets on with explaining your task.\n\nHe says he\u2019s teleporting you to a plateau in the Cloudpeak Mountains. From there he says Tych will lead the way. Apparently in the year he was experimenting on you, he was also having Tych locate a wazia lair in that area.\n\nOther than your regular clothes, he enchants your short sword so it will be more effective in combat, and then hands you one of those rare repeating crossbows and a quiver of bolts.\n\n\u201cI hope you know how to use one of these.\u201d Ral remarks.\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with flintlocks, but I imagine this is probably easier seeing as this is one of the state of the art crossbows. These repeating ones are rare and expensive. Didn\u2019t know you kept up on technological advances though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? Just because I don\u2019t have any use for it, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t see the utility of it for the unwashed masses. I figure between that and your enchanted weapon, you should be more than prepared. Your pack is over there. Has some food and climbing gear in it. Should be more than enough to help you.\u201d\n\nYou go over and get your pack; Tych is hovering by it, looking just as miserable as you feel right now.\n\n\u201cThe pair of you ready, I trust?\u201d Ral asks.\n\u201cI guess.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTych is magically tied to me, so there is no need for fairy circles or any other places of power this time. You just need to very close to him for the transportation to work on you, along with him making the appropriate signal so I can pull him back here, I trust you remember was that was Tych?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Ral.\u201d Tych responds in a defeated manner and flies onto your shoulder.\n\u201cGood, I expect you\u2019ll be successful like last time and just think, you\u2019ll be a free man afterwards, so you have plenty of motivation.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Ral waves his hands a bit and your eyes are met with a bright light, followed by more bright light, though this is of the natural kind.\n\nYou look and see that your surroundings are that of a flat icy, snowy landscape with mountains and hills nearby and the sun shining overhead. There isn\u2019t a soul around though save for Tych who instantly gets off of you.\n\n\u201cFuck, you\u2019re not much warmer than this horrible landscape. So much for using you for extra warmth.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel much of anything. I mean I can sense the wind blowing, but there\u2019s just a dull cool feeling. It\u2019s not unpleasant, but it isn\u2019t pleasant either.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWell, Ral did experiment on you. I have to say, I\u2019ll be glad when this mission is over with, because I\u2019ve had enough of freezing my fucking wings off here. Scouting around for large hostile monsters in the snow and cold isn\u2019t my idea of a good time. I\u2019d rather be in the fucking jar.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he needs us to do this anyway. I mean he\u2019s a fucking powerful wizard, couldn\u2019t he have done this himself a lot easier?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he could have, but he\u2019s a fucking sadist. Why else would he make you into some slave boy and then turn you into a freak and keep me in a damn jar, play teleportation snap back with me for the past year and also have me scout around this icy wasteland?\u201d\n\u201cHow long has that been going on?\u201d\n\u201cOh a little after he put you in that trance and started cutting into you and doing who knows what else. Ral\u2019s experiments on you might have been done sooner if he hadn\u2019t gotten distracted with other things. He keeps trying to make greater strides in teleportation spells and I think he\u2019s planning on making a portal next. Of course he needs to test shit so he uses me as a fucking canary and then snaps me back home when he thinks enough time has passed. Makes me physically ill every time he does it. Those first few months I puked on every trip.\u201d\n\nTych fixes his little fur hat before continuing.\n\n\u201cAnd in these last few months? I\u2019ve teleported back and forth to this fucking place looking for a wazia like I\u2019m some great monster hunter! I don\u2019t want to fucking do this! My instinct is to fly AWAY from really big ravenous monsters, not seek them out!\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I don\u2019t want to be here either.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re free after all this! I\u2019m not. Even if the wazia kills you, you\u2019ll still be doing better than me, but I don\u2019t think that will be the case, check you pack. You\u2019ll find something better than what Ral supplied you with.\u201d\n\nYou take off you pack and at the top you find a clear bottle of something dark green. It feels slightly warm even to you.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is this? Looks like some sort of poison.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd you would be correct. It\u2019s greenfire from the plant of the same name. They\u2019re normally only found in the Sotakian swamp and even then they\u2019re rare. In any case, Ral had it lying around his lab and while you two were talking I took the opportunity to lug it into your pack. Hey, I\u2019m stronger than I look, especially with all the hardship I\u2019ve had to endure.\u201d Tych explains.\n\u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s it do exactly?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not called greenfire for nothing. It gets in your blood and makes you feel like your blood and innards are on fire. The effects are pretty quick though you\u2019re in excruciating pain before you die.\n\u201cOkay, so I should just dip my bolts into this to bring down the beast a lot easier.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Are you kidding? Even with this poison, I doubt very seriously that you\u2019ll be able to kill it before it kills you. I take it you\u2019ve never even seen a wazia.\u201d\n\u201cNope, just know them by stories.\u201d\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t know anything about them at all, but after seeing one, I can tell you that the stories don\u2019t do them justice.\u201d\n\u201cThen what the hell are you suggesting then?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just telling you that your odds aren\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve practically been asleep an entire year and this is the situation you\u2019ve awoken to. You\u2019ve been magically altered and thrust into a bad situation and now you have to put up with an obnoxious sprite on top of everything else.\n\n\u201cTych, just take me to the fucking lair.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAlright, alright, no need to snap at me, plivik.\u201d Tych responds.\n\u201cI know what that means, you little shit.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, you do\u2026well let\u2019s just get on with it then like you said.\u201d\n\nYou begin to follow Tych. Every now and then you reflexively wrap your cloak around yourself in order to stay warm, but then you also remember you don\u2019t really have that problem anymore. It wouldn\u2019t help anyway; you still feel a numb coolness no matter what you do since that sensation is coming from within your body as opposed to the external reasons.\n\nYou suppose this condition is beneficial out here in a place like this, but you can\u2019t imagine going through the rest of your life like this. After all this is over, you\u2019re going to have to seek out a way to reverse or cure it, if it\u2019s even possible. You wonder if that\u2019s what Ral has planned for you. He \u201cfrees\u201d you, but in exchange for changing you back to normal, you have to undergo some sort of servitude again.\n\nYou really wish you just let the mob back in Teckleville kill you at this point, with any luck maybe the wazia will.\n\nYou travel in the freezing mountainous terrain for two days. (At some point during all this you take the opportunity to poison your bolts) Even with your immunity to the cold, it\u2019s still a treacherous journey given that you\u2019re no mountain climber. Tych has lead you through to the path of least resistance to the lair and fortunately it isn\u2019t actually very high up, in fact it\u2019s actually at a lower altitude than where you originally teleported in.\n\n\u201cLet me guess, it\u2019s in this large sloping dark cave.\u201d You say to Tych.\n\u201cGot it right in one. I saw it entering here a few times and judging by the large pile of bones out here, I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely a permanent home for it. Well I\u2019ll wait out here. If you aren\u2019t out within a day, I can safely assume you\u2019ve met your demise.\u201d Tych says.\n\u201cWait, how the hell am I going to see in there? Despite my magical alteration, I don\u2019t have dark vision unfortunately. I need you to come with me and sparkle a bit so I have some light.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That wasn\u2019t part of the plan. I go in and start sparkling and I\u2019m going to be a target since it\u2019ll see me first!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re also a small target that can fly all over the place. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to go after you if it can get a target on the ground that\u2019s shooting bolts at it a lot easier.\u201d\n\nTych REALLY isn\u2019t keen on this idea, but given that he wants to be out of this situation as much as you do, he relents.\n\n\u201cAlright, fine. But only because you\u2019re probably right about the wazia going after you and the fact that despite everything, you\u2019ve dealt pretty straight with me. I still remember when you didn\u2019t rat me out to Ral about the last time we worked together\u2026wait\u2026you hear that?\u201d Tych suddenly says mid sentence.\n\u201cShit, is it the wazia?\u201d you ask, not hearing the sounds other than the wind, but readying your crossbow.\n\u201cNo, if it was that, we\u2019d already be fucked. It\u2019s a small whine. You don\u2019t hear it? It\u2019s coming from over there.\u201d\n\nTych points over to a group of rocks and large bones. (and then he flies behind you). You now hear the sounds too, and with your crossbow ready and slowly move towards where they\u2019re coming from.\n\nWhatever is making the noise can\u2019t be that big since rock and bone pile isn\u2019t very large either, when you finally walk around it, you see what is making the noise.\n\nA small feline creature with an odd-looking face making pitiful whimpers. It looks up at you and backs up and raising its tail, which looks like it has small spikes on it. It attempts to growl a bit, but it\u2019s obvious the beast is frightened. As it stands right now, the pair of you are both ready to shoot.\n\n\u201cShit, that\u2019s a manticore.\u201d Tych says and takes cover behind you again.\n\u201cWhat? That? I thought they were much bigger.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cub, plivik. Still, I wouldn\u2019t want to get shot by one of those spikes.\u201d\n\u201cWell that must mean its mother is nearby. Are you sure you got the right lair?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure! Its mother probably got eaten by the wazia and somehow it managed to escape. Hey, you know we could use this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWazias pretty much eat anything thrown at them. If you poisoned this cub, you could toss it at the wazia who would inevitably consume it and the poison would work even better. At the very least it would cause the creature so much pain it would slow it down giving you a chance to shoot it a lot more with bolts.\u201d\n\nYou look at the manticore, which is still looking pretty pitiful, but still also in a fighting position. You aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019ll be quick enough to shoot him before he shoots you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot the manticore", "result": "Tych\u2019s plan has merit and would make your task easier. Also you\u2019d probably be putting this beast out of its misery given that its mother died and will likely get eaten by the wazia anyway. Might as well put it to good use.\n\nYou pull the trigger of your crossbow and hit the manticore, but unfortunately it\u2019s not a fatal shot and you only hit it in between its front limb and chest. It makes an odd combination of a roaring whine and flings its barbs at you.\n\nYou\u2019re not quick enough to dodge completely and get hit in the leg. While your condition makes you number to pain, it doesn\u2019t make it disappear completely. You curse, fall down and from your prone position quickly fire the remainder of you bolt clip at the manticore blindly. You get lucky and some of those actually hit the creature causing it to make a final howl before dying.\n\nAs you\u2019re attempting pull manticore barbs out of your leg, Tych appears again now that all the danger is over with.\n\n\u201cThought you were usually quicker than that.\u201d Tych sniffs.\n\u201cGimme a fucking break, I\u2019ve been incapacitated for a year, not to mention this new condition I have is fucking up my reflexes. Shit\u2026\u201d you say looking at the new holes in your leg.\n\u201cWell at least you got your bait now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess so. Let\u2019s get on with this\u201d\n\nYou limp over to the dead manticore cub and reclaim your bolts before picking up its carcass. You then enter the cave with Tych barely following ahead of you. He\u2019s flying as high as he can which provides just enough light for you to not break your neck walking around the cave.\n\nAs you were travelling here earlier, Tych was telling you a bit about wazias. He mentioned that they resembled very large moles with a huge gaping maw where the face would be. The mole comparison doesn\u2019t sound very threatening, but he also said that it has a very tough hide and layers of fat, which is why Tych doesn\u2019t think your bolts, would be as effective as they might otherwise be.\n\nHopefully this poisoned manticore body will help. You suppose you\u2019ll find out.\n\nYou start to hear loud sounds, you can\u2019t see anything yet, but you have to be getting closer.\n\nThe loud sounds soon become rumbles and then Tych suddenly shouts to you.\n\n\u201cShit, it\u2019s digging under you! Get the hell out of there!\u201d\n\nTych begins flying back towards the exit and you do likewise as the rumbling is nearly right under you. In your haste, you drop the manticore body, hoping that maybe the creature will pop up to eat it.\n\nIt would be hard enough to keep up with Tych under normal circumstances, but thanks you\u2019re your leg wounds, you\u2019re attempting the impossible. You end up stumbling and tripping in the decreasing light that he\u2019s giving off as he flits away.\n\nYour verbal commands of getting Tych to stop have no effect and soon, he\u2019s gotten so far ahead of you, you\u2019re left in the dark causing you to completely fall over as you continue to trip over shit.\n\nYou don\u2019t have time to get back up when the rumbling is now coming from right underneath you.\n\nYou never even see the beast, you just feel yourself sinking into the ground and then several sharp teeth, crushing, piercing and cutting your body whole. The only consolation is it happened so quick that you didn\u2019t even feel it.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Back off slowly", "result": "Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re in a shitty situation yourself that you\u2019re feeling a bit sorry for the pitiful creature that presumably just lost its mother and now has to fend for itself.\n\n\u201cFuck it.\u201d You say, and slowly start backing away, though the beast never lets its own guard down.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing. Shoot the little bastard!\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it alright? Besides, I\u2019ll probably need to save all the bolts I can for the wazia.\u201d\n\nYou get out of the line of sight of the manticore, but Tych won\u2019t let this go.\n\n\u201cAre you actually feeling sympathy for the creature? This thing would eat you if it was big enough! In fact, given that its probably hungry without its mother around now, I\u2019m surprised it isn\u2019t at least attempting to anyway! Think of it this way, it can\u2019t survive very long on its own, you\u2019d be performing an act of mercy if you killed it and at least its death would help us.\u201d\n\nAt this point you take off your pack and look for some of your remaining rations. Dried meat, it\u2019s as good as anything.\n\n\u201cWait, are you actually going to feed it now? Have you gone completely barmy?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d You say.\n\nYou go back to the manticore which once again has adopted a defensive stance, but you toss the meat in front of it which it cautiously moves close to, sniffs and then starts to eat, all the while still eyeing you suspiciously.\n\nYou leave the beast to feed.\n\n\u201cYou know, you could have at least poisoned the food if you didn\u2019t have the balls to just shoot it.\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m just going to have to get my balls back by killing this wazia, now stop bitching at me and let\u2019s get this done.\u201d You snap.\n\nYou enter the cave with Tych barely following ahead of you. He\u2019s flying as high as he can which provides just enough light for you to not break your neck walking around the cave.\n\nAs you were travelling here earlier, Tych was telling you a bit about wazias. He mentioned that they resembled very large moles with a huge gaping maw where the face would be. The mole comparison doesn\u2019t sound very threatening, but he also said that it has a very tough hide and layers of fat, which is why Tych doesn\u2019t think your bolts, would be as effective as they might otherwise be.\n\nYou suppose you\u2019ll find out.\n\nYou start to hear loud sounds, you can\u2019t see anything yet, but you have to be getting closer.\n\nThe loud sounds soon become rumbles and then Tych suddenly shouts to you.\n\n\u201cShit, it\u2019s digging under you! Get the hell out of there!\u201d\n\nTych begins flying back towards the exit and you do likewise as the rumbling is nearly right under you.\n\nWhile its hard to keep up with Tych, you manage to do so. By the time you see the light of the exit, the rumbling is nearly coming from right underneath you. You instinctively jump forward just in time for the wazia finally come up and try to eat you.\n\nYou get up as quickly as you can and that\u2019s when you finally see the creature. And it does indeed resemble a giant mole. A giant mole with nothing but a giant mouth with rows of teeth for a face. It also has pretty large claws as well, but you\u2019re too busy trying get out of its immediate grasp as opposed to admiring them.\n\nYou make it outside with the wazia following close behind. When you\u2019re out in the open, you take advantage of the light and space and begin firing your crossbow at the thing which has mixed results.\n\nYour aim isn\u2019t exactly true due to nerves and generally trying to staying away from the wazia, but it hardly matters when it\u2019s as big as it is. Most of your shots hit, but much like Tych warned, its tough hide seems to be outright deflecting a lot of them. And for the bolts that are actually sinking in, you certainly hope the poison starts working soon, because so far it hasn\u2019t had any notable affect.\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s in your favor is that the beast isn\u2019t exactly the fastest when not underground, but it tries to keep you off balance by smashing its claws on the ground and causing minor quakes. Large clumps of snow begin to fall from above and given your location, you\u2019re wondering if an avalanche won\u2019t just bury you at this rate. (Of course maybe that\u2019s its intent, it can just easily dig itself out and eat your corpse later)\n\nYou see Tych keeping his distance, flying about watching everything.\n\n\u201cTych, distract it damn it! I need to reload this thing!\u201d you shout while running and fumbling with the cumbersome crossbow magazine.\n\nTo his credit, Tych actually listens somewhat to you and shouts at it (in his high pitched squeaky voice) and even flies near it very briefly, but his presence is mostly ignored. Tych doesn\u2019t try too much harder than that, but you do get another helper.\n\nThe manitcore cub that you fed earlier and completely forgot about starts flinging its own spikes at the wazia. They don\u2019t seem to do anything to it, but between it and Tych, it\u2019s enough to refocus its attention briefly giving you enough time to reload your crossbow properly.\n\nYou fire a few times at the wazia with mixed results again, the manticore cub runs fast enough that the wazia doesn\u2019t bother to follow it and quickly turns its attention back to you.\n\nIt charges at you, but now you\u2019re starting to notice the beast is getting even slower and now begins making loud wailing noises and they aren\u2019t just due to anger. The wazia is finally feeling the affects of the poison and begins flailing about. It begins smashing its entire body into the ground and now even larger chunks of ice and snow begin to fall from above.\n\nAlong with it trying to cause an avalanche, it begins trying to dig underground again since it isn\u2019t sure what is exactly causing it such great pain, and is trying to escape. You can\u2019t allow that to happen though, because if it does, even if it dies, it\u2019s going to be so deep underground that digging its carcass out is going to be a nightmare.\n\nThrowing a bit of caution to the wind, you get closer to wazia and fire upon it. Your fortunate enough that this stops it from digging long enough to try to swipe at you with its claws. It clumsily tries to do this several times. At this point you\u2019ve run out of bolts and drawn your sword though realistically you wouldn\u2019t be able to get close enough to it that it couldn\u2019t still kill you. You\u2019re just trying to keep the beast from escaping and hoping the mountains don\u2019t come crashing down on your head.\n\nEventually as its motions towards you stop altogether and it opens its maw completely one last time to let out a woeful howl and then collapses. It twitches a few more times and finally stops moving completely.\n\nYou just look at the wazia for a moment before slowly moving closer to it. Just as you get to its body, Tych sneaks up on you.\n\n\u201cIs it dead?\u201d he asks, buzzing in your ear.\n\u201cDamn it Tych, you fucking startled me!\u201d you snap.\n\u201cApologies, but I figured you\u2019d be more aware of your surroundings.\u201d\n\u201cI guess its dead. Shit, I was wondering if that poison was ever going to kick in.\u201d\n\u201cYep, looks like I saved your ass on this one.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I guess you did your part.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight I did, which is why I think YOU should help me now!\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell am I going to help you?\u201d\n\u201cBy killing Ral obviously.\u201d\n\u201cNice idea, but I\u2019m still bound by a geas remember?\u201d\n\u201cWell after he takes it off of you, just chop his head off.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, like he isn\u2019t going to take precautions. I\u2019m fairly certain that if he does stick with his promise, I\u2019m not going to be able to just chop his head off as you say. In fact I imagine he\u2019s set this up so I stay bound to him so he can reverse this condition I have.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you aren\u2019t actually going to DO that if freedom is an option are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat choice do I have? It\u2019s not like I want to go through the rest of my life like this.\u201d\n\u201cShit, I\u2019d go through life with my wings fucking clipped if it meant not spending most of my life in a jar and being at that plivik\u2019s whims!\u201d\n\nYou suppose Tych has a point and it is one you\u2019re more inclined to go with since it might be possible to get your condition reversed elsewhere.\n\nAll this might not mean anything however, if Ral has no intention on releasing you from the geas anyway. In the meantime you have a heart to carve out of the dead beast in front of you.\n\nAbout midway through Tych starts calling to you again.\n\n\u201cHey! Watch out, the manticore is back!\u201d he exclaims and hides on the other side of the dead wazia.\n\nYou turn from your bloody work and look. The manticore cub is indeed back and watching you, but its not in a defensive stance anymore, it seems to be more curious than anything else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worrying about it since it probably isn\u2019t going to do anything, but if it makes you feel better\u2026\u201d\n\nTych probably thought you were going to follow up that statement with you trying to kill it, but you instead you just reach into your pack and give it another piece of dried meat, which it happily eats and no longer is interested in anything else.\n\n\u201cThere you go Spikey.\u201d You say coming up with an on the spot name for him.\n\u201cYou just gave away the last of the food!\u201d Tych exclaims.\n\u201cWhat does it matter? As soon as I dig this heart out, and you perch on my shoulder, Ral will teleport us back anyway right?\u201d\n\u201cI guess, I just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re indulging that creature.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing I did, since it distracted the wazia better than you did.\u201d\n\u201cHey I did my best considering my size, you dick!\u201d\n\nYou go back to your unpleasant work. Not so much because of the gore and blood, but the smell is awful even with your dulled senses. Eventually you cut the large organ out and carry the thing out of the wazia\u2019s body. You then sit down to take a breather.\n\n\u201cShit, I think that was almost as much work as killing this thing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Tych asks.\n\u201cYeah, why are you so far away? I figured you\u2019d be anxious to get out of this cold at least even if you don\u2019t like the jar.\u201d\n\u201cI would, but that thing is nearby!\u201d Tych remarks and points to the manticore that is now coming up to you.\n\u201cTych, you\u2019re worrying over nothing. He\u2019d fling spikes at me before you given how close he is. Just get over here and get us home.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Did you think anymore on killing Ral yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve thought about it, and I guess you\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d\n\nTych isn\u2019t enthused by your response or the manticore being nearby, but he flies to you anyway. He sits on your shoulder, makes a few weird hand gestures and before you know it, a flash of blinding light hits you and you\u2019re in the lab again. You also feel something bump your leg.\n\nYou look down and see that the manticore cub has teleported with you and is currently nuzzling against your leg.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Tych remarks and flies away to hide again.\n\nMeanwhile Ral walks in from one of his other rooms in the lab wondering what all the noise is about.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re back and successful as I knew you would be. Hello, what\u2019s this?\u201d Ral asks.\n\nSpikey growls a bit when he sees Ral.\n\n\u201cSpikey no!\u201d you say and do your best to try to calm him which involves petting his head and neck. This seems to work somewhat since he relaxes, but still eyes Ral warily.\n\n\u201cHmm, I see you brought back more than just the heart. You didn\u2019t need to go beyond what was required, but I appreciate the enthusiasm. The manticore parts will come in handy for spell components.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cWhat? No, it helped take down the wazia and I guess it got caught up in the teleportation process.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo, I dunno seems sort of fucked up to just hand him over to you for parts after he helped me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with him, keep him as a pet?\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose I could\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA pet manticore? What do you think you are a frost giant? That\u2019s silly, you aren\u2019t going to have the means to tame such a beast when he starts to grow! You sure you don\u2019t want to hand that beast over? I could give you something extra.\u201d\n\u201cCan you reverse this fucking condition you imposed on me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI imagine could, but that would require that you stick around a bit longer. I mean that can be arranged...\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not getting trapped. You can\u2019t get trapped again.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll figure out another way.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well. Put that heart on the table and... wait a minute where did Tych go? I saw him fly off to hide, not sure why he bothers to do that, since he knows I can just teleport him back in the jar at anytime.\u201d Ral says as you lift up the oversized organ and slam it on the nearby table.\n\n\u201cCan we get on with this?\u201d you ask getting impatient.\n\u201cIn a moment and don\u2019t presume to give orders, I still haven\u2019t freed you yet and you\u2019d be well to remember that. Now step back, you\u2019re very cold you know.\u201d Ral says.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m fucking cold, you did this to me!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I offered to reverse the process, but you declined.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight I declined, I\u2019m not going to fall for your tricks again. The first time you enslaved me, the second time you made me into a freak!\u201d\n\u201cIf you like, that can remain your reality.\u201d Ral warns.\n\nRal raises his hands as if to cast a spell and that\u2019s when you see Tych flying over his head struggling with a small-uncorked glass tube that\u2019s as big as him.\n\n\u201cHey glakface, try casting magic now!\u201d Tych shouts and then pours a clear fluid on Ral, who looks up just in time for it splatter on his face, and he even gets some in his mouth.\n\n\u201cGargh! (cough) (hack) blagh!\u201d Ral gags and begins hacking up and rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t cast magic! Don\u2019t just stand there plivik, kill the bastard!\u201d Tych squeaks.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take advantage of the situation", "result": "Given your recent exchange with Ral and your own suspicious nature, you question if Ral intends on releasing you. Perhaps getting rid of Ral IS the way to go and this would be the best time to do it.\n\nYou\u2019re still under the effects of the geas, and any violent action towards Ral by you would be met with immediate pain, however with his temporary inability to cast spells you wonder if you couldn\u2019t dispose of him quick enough that you\u2019d survive it.\n\nNot to mention you do have a pet manticore now.\n\n\u201cSpikey attack! ARGH!\u201d you shout and feel a sharp pain to your crotch, which causes you to nearly double over. The only reason why you aren\u2019t completely laid out is your new condition has dulled some of your pain reception to a small degree. (Now is one of those times it came in handy)\n\nSpikey isn\u2019t completely sure what you meant, but given that you\u2019re excitedly pointing at Ral who is also making loud noises and flailing about due to the shit that Tych poured on him, Spikey isn\u2019t feeling comfortable towards him anyway.\n\nSpikey flings several small quills into Ral\u2019s body. The old wizard howls in pain. Spikey may be just a manticore cub, but it still hurts.\n\nDue to the geas, a large part of you wants to stop Spikey from attacking and it\u2019s taking everything for you not to do that. You feel the pain spread over your body and it\u2019s getting worse. You finally collapse to the floor.\n\nSpikey runs forward and begins biting Ral, he even succeeds in ripping off part of his hand. Ral is begging for mercy at this point, but he\u2019s getting nothing, but Tych\u2019s taunts.\n\nYou weakly pull out a dagger, but you can barely hold it in your hand as you attempt to crawl over to Ral. The pain you\u2019re experiencing is nearly unbearable.\n\nMeanwhile Ral is experiencing his own form of pain, but despite being unable to cast magic and being a frail old man, he somehow manages to get Spikey off of him, who yelps when thrown into a nearby table.\n\n\u201cCome here, you little bastard!\u201d he snarls and with a blink, Tych is suddenly within the one good hand of Ral. It would appear his powers are starting to come back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to crush you into\u2026ARGH SHIT!\u201d Ral shouts as you plunge your dagger into his ankle.\n\nThe old man partially falls on top of you, but that doesn\u2019t compare to the wave of agony you experience after stabbing Ral. Your condition is no longer numbing anything, not even a little bit.\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re suffering a heart attack, castration and a mace smashing your brains in, all the while being burned alive.\n\nUnsurprisingly your body goes into complete shock, shuts down and you go unconscious. Blackness follows.\n\nTime passes and eventually you wake up to a couple sensations. One being a rough tongue licking your face and another being a faint sweet taste on your lips and in your mouth.\n\n\u201cHey! Did it work? You alive?\u201d Tych remarks.\n\u201cGuh, buh, what work?\u201d you sputter and move a bit causing Spikey to stop licking your face.\n\u201cThe healing potion I tried to pour into your mouth. I guess it did, you\u2019re alive. Wasn\u2019t sure it worked since you looked pretty dead.\u201d\n\u201cI felt really dead. Is Ral dead?\u201d\n\u201cOh that plivik? Yeah. Your pet took care of that soon after you stabbed him. Ripped out his throat. I don\u2019t think that spell is on you anymore.\u201d\n\nYou look at your wrist and it\u2019s true, you no longer see the mark there anymore.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it. I\u2019m free. Finally free.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, thanks to me.\u201d Tych sniffs.\n\u201cRal was planning on releasing me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that. If you did, you wouldn\u2019t have nearly killed yourself, trying to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose I did have my doubts and followed your lead. What was that shit you poured on him anyway?\u201d\n\u201cOh, liquefied gazer eye. Not sure what Ral was planning with it, but then he was always experimenting with shit.\u201d\n\u201cNot familiar with gazers.\u201d\n\u201cLucky you, they\u2019re even worse than wazias. Anyway, you\u2019re not the only one who is free, so I guess this is where we part ways.\u201d\n\nAs strange as it seems you\u2019re a little taken back by how quick Tych is to part company, but then it wasn\u2019t like you two were great friends or anyway.\n\n\u201cOh. Okay. Yeah sure, I suppose you\u2019ll be wanting to go home to your wife.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026what the hell, I\u2019ll let you on a little secret, I\u2019m not married. I just said I was hoping it would gain me sympathy when we first met.\u201d Tych admits.\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re right, I am still going home. I need to straighten out some things there. What were you planning on doing?\u201d\n\u201cDunno really. I still got this condition. First thing I think I need to do is try to figure out how to reverse it. Guess I\u2019ll start by heading to Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cWell sounds like you\u2019ve got the adventure ahead of you. Can\u2019t say it was a pleasure being forced to work with you, but I suppose it could have been worse. And we both got revenge on Ral, so it worked out I guess. See you around blivik.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? Dickhead or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh blivik? No, it means friend. Well maybe not friend, but comrade in arms I guess.\u201d\n\u201cSounds very similar plivik.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, sometimes in our culture the two are interchangeable.\u201d\n\u201cThat I can believe. Bye Tych and thanks.\u201d\n\nTych nods his head and flies out the lab door, leaving you alone. (Well with a manticore cub that is currently eating Ral\u2019s body nearby).\n\nYou don\u2019t leave right away, instead you take the opportunity to start going through Ral\u2019s lab seeing if you can find any clue of what he did to you. You find lots notes, but his handwriting is pretty bad and you can\u2019t make much sense of the diagrams. You think they might pertain to you, but you aren\u2019t really sure.\n\nYou temporarily slump in a chair nearby realizing that you\u2019ve lost some of your life and your thoughts keep wandering back to Lisa. What happened to her? You were supposed to meet up with her in Holgard as you often did. At the time the city was on the verge of a rebellion. Does she even still live? And if she does, she surely must believe you are dead and moved on.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit depressing considering your feelings for her, but lost love is the least of your concerns right now. You suppose either way, your next move is to Holgard, either to seek her out or to seek a way to fix your condition.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re sitting on a small fortune of magical equipment. Granted you don\u2019t know what most of it does, but at the very least, you\u2019d be able to get a good price for some of the stuff that you can\u2019t figure out. Holgard will be the perfect place to\n\nAt the very least you can use this place as a home of sorts which seems strange given that you\u2019ve been stuck here, but then you\u2019re not exactly beholden to Ral anymore and it\u2019s not a bad place as far as homes go. You even have a pet to defend it when you\u2019re not around.\n\nYou spend a few more days going through Ral\u2019s house before finally deciding to make your way to Holgard. Takes awhile to convince Spikey not to follow you, but eventually he gets the hint and stays around the house. You figure he\u2019s probably more than able to hunt whatever wildlife is in the area.\n\nYou make your way to Holgard and the journey is uneventful and the same as you remembered, though you\u2019re noticing that when you camp down for the night, the next morning the grass has a layer of frost on it. You\u2019re going to be leaving a trail of it at this pace.\n\nWhen you get to Holgard, you find that the city is a lot calmer than when you remember. While doing some business with an apothecary, you learn that the old ruler got overthrown and his daughter now rules the city.\n\n\u201cYeah, be glad you missed that one. It was a pretty brutal time\u2026did it just get chilly in here? In fact, did the temperature drop outside because everything you\u2019ve handed over to sell feels a bit cold to the touch.\u201d the apothecary says.\n\u201cHadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d You answer.\n\u201c\u2026you uh sure you\u2019re all right pal? You look a little pale. I figured when you came in here you came in to buy, not to sell.\u201d\n\u201cYou got anything that can cure this?\u201d you say and grab the apothecary\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cShit! You\u2019re fucking ice! Let me go! Please! Take anything you want!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to rob you! I\u2019m serious when I ask, if you have anything that can cure this condition.\u201d You say and let go of the man\u2019s wrist.\n\nThe apothecary steps back and rubs his wrist a bit.\n\n\u201cI can honestly tell you that I have nothing that would help you. I can only believe that magic must be at work. Is that the case?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah, and I killed the wizard who did it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess he had it coming. Wasn\u2019t one of those Dornans was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHm, okay that\u2019s good, because they\u2019re about the only folks that I think would be able to help you. They\u2019re pretty interested in all things pertaining to magic, though I\u2019d be careful since it\u2019ll be the knowledge that\u2019s important, not the person. You might have killed a wizard, but I don\u2019t think even you would be able to kill a whole temple of them if things go south.\u201d\n\u201cNoted. Can\u2019t think of anyone else?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, I mean unless you want to head all the way to Delantium Kingdom and their magic university. It has a good reputation and they aren\u2019t swayed by religious fanaticism. There\u2019s a small magic college in Klyton, but I wouldn\u2019t waste my time.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I graduated from there and the magic college there is rubbish, that\u2019s why. It\u2019s understaffed and only kept afloat due to one of the council members being a mage. It\u2019s not bad if you want to learn how to mix potions and such, but the wizards there aren\u2019t exactly the most skilled in magic and they\u2019d probably be just as baffled by your condition as I am. You\u2019d probably end up as a toad with their bumbling.\u201c\n\nGreat, more wizards.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to the Delantium Kingdom", "result": "The Dornans might be closer, but they also sound like religious fanatics. You don\u2019t really need to deal with that right now. You\u2019re not exactly keen on dragging your cold ass all the way to the Delantium Kingdom, but if it\u2019s your best shot, then that\u2019s where you need to go.\n\nBesides, maybe it might be good anyway. You\u2019ve spent more than enough time around Holgard and its surrounding area and it hasn\u2019t got you very far, maybe a change in scenery is in order. It isn\u2019t like things have gone that great for you around here and as for Lisa, if she\u2019s still alive, you have no doubt that she\u2019s moved on with her life. Maybe she\u2019s even some high-ranking Ebony Claw member. Whatever she\u2019s doing, you hope she\u2019s doing well at it.\n\nYou leave the apothecary and head to the docks to book a passage to the Delantium Kingdom.\n\nUnsurprisingly you get some strange looks, and the first couple captains turn you away believing that your unnatural chill must be the result of a curse and don\u2019t want it rubbing off on the voyage. (You can\u2019t blame them for their caution since they\u2019re at least half right about it being a curse of sorts)\n\nEventually though you get a captain with less interest in gods and suspicion and more interested in coin. You pay the man and make your way to the cargo area since he doesn\u2019t have any more room for proper passengers, and he apparently thinks you\u2019ll keep some of the food fresher on the long trip just with your presence.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ve been in less than ideal conditions before. You just need a ride; this isn\u2019t going to be forever.\n\nYou make your way down to the cargo hold where you make a place for yourself near the crates of lemons and limes. It\u2019s as good as any. You\u2019ll have lots of time to think on your way to your destination.\n\nOne of your main thoughts is what you\u2019re going to do with your life if you do get cured. Obviously being a rogue never really worked out for you. Arguably, you haven\u2019t been one since you left Teckleville. You\u2019ve had more \u201cwork\u201d as a monster hunter of all things. Not that it\u2019s something you necessarily wanted to make a living at doing, but you have raised your skill with a weapon over the years, not to mention all your new outdoorsman skills. Maybe you should be doing something using those talents instead at this point. You\u2019re sure you\u2019d be good at it.\n\nMakes you realize that if you had those skills to begin with instead, you probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten lost in the forest and in Ral\u2019s debt in the first place. Of course if that hadn\u2019t happened, you wouldn\u2019t have gained what you do know now. Funny how that works. Also funny how it finally took you until now to realize that your parents were right all along and that this \u201clife\u201d was just going to lead to trouble.\n\nIn any case, you aren\u2019t sure what the future holds, if you\u2019ll be cured, if you\u2019ll remain this way or if you\u2019ll be killed in the process.

You\u2019re going to just be on your guard as usual. You figure while you\u2019re at it, you can look into trying to find out what happened to Lisa and if she\u2019s still around.\n\nYou ask the apothecary where the temple is since it isn\u2019t exactly a place you ever visited when you used to come to the city and your memory is still hazy on where everything is again.\n\nYou head to the temple and while you remain hooded as usual, you still draw a little attention from people who are close enough to get a better look at you. Fortunately, you\u2019re strange enough looking that nobody gets hostile.\n\nWhen you get to the temple, you don\u2019t even get very far since two of its members stop you just inside the entrance.\n\n\u201cAnd just where do you think you\u2019re going, you\u2026what the hell are you anyway? Damn you\u2019re cold, step back.\u201d a man with a goatee asks.\n\u201cYeah, I was hoping you guys could help me with this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe we should tell Elder Flynn about this, Travis.\u201d The other one says.\n\u201cThe Elder is in meditation and can\u2019t be disturbed for a week, you know that! Still, this is something he might find interesting. Tell me, how did you come to be this way?\u201d Travis asks.\n\nYou give a brief rundown on what happened, when you mention Ral by name the pair of them seems more interested in that, than what happened to you.\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re telling me that YOU killed Ral?\u201d Travis asks.\n\u201cI helped\u2026oh shit\u2026he wasn\u2019t secretly a Dorna worshipper was he?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo true follower of Dorna would do it in secret! He was an infidel as far as I know. Though honestly, I\u2019m not too familiar with the man, Elder Flynn apparently knows him quite well and all I know about that is they\u2019re not fond of each other. So\u2026he\u2019s dead huh?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, this is something Elder Flynn would definitely want to know about. Unfortunately as I said, he\u2019s in meditation and can\u2019t be disturbed at all. You could come back then. I\u2019m sure the Elder would be able to help.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess I can wait a little longer. So I just come back here in a week?\u201d\n\u201cYes, in a week.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d\n\nYou turn to leave and look back to see Travis and his buddy whispering about something. Probably about you no doubt.\n\nStill, at least they didn\u2019t try to do anything bad to you or anything, though that\u2019s still a possibility you suppose.\n\nThe only thing to do now is wait, but you\u2019re going to have to find something to do in the meantime. You could go back home, but you honestly don\u2019t feel like making that trek again, not to mention after spending so much time in Ral\u2019s house, you aren\u2019t exactly itching to go back so soon.\n\nYou have more than enough money so you figure you\u2019ll just find an inn to stay at.\n\nYou stay at a place called the Baroness. (Named after the current ruler no doubt) The innkeeper is a bit wary of you, but after giving him a few extra coins for a room he no longer has a problem with you. (Other than telling you to stand back from him)\n\nYou spend a couple days not doing much of anything important except information gathering. It\u2019s difficult to eavesdrop on conversations (let alone trying to strike up one) with your new condition, but you do manage to at least figure out some basics on the underworld situation.\n\nApparently along with there being a new ruler, the Ebony Claw Syndicate has a greater monopoly on all criminal activity in the city. There are still independents as such things can never be completely wiped out, but the Thieves\u2019 Guild was completely destroyed along with any other minor organized rivals\n\nLast time you remember, Lisa said she was thinking about joining them. At the time you hoped she wouldn\u2019t, but given the situation now, you suppose if she has, it\u2019s better that she picked the winning side. Of course this is all still assuming she\u2019s alive or even still in the city.\n\nYou can\u2019t be sure of any of this, but since you have time to kill and not much else going on, you seek out Ebony Claw members to question. Not exactly something most do, but then you don\u2019t have much to lose and at this point you\u2019d wager that you\u2019re a much better than average fighter than you used to be if it comes to that.\n\nYou head to a place called the Poisoned Blade Inn, which even before they took over the entire underworld was a known Ebony Claw hang out.\n\nAs soon as you enter, it\u2019s almost like the Dorna Temple all over again, because you gain everyone\u2019s attention, mainly because you don\u2019t even bother covering yourself with a hood like you normally do.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026this is an unusual sight.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like the Dornans have been experimenting again.\u201d\n\u201cDid it just get colder in here?\u201d\n\u201cHey, pale man! You lost?\u201d\n\u201cCareful, he looks like he might have magic about him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well he ain\u2019t the only one.\u201d\n\nSeveral obvious ECS members are already converging on your position.\n\n\u201cNot here for trouble, just looking for the most direct way of getting answers. Does anyone here know a woman named Lisa? She\u2019d be around my age.\u201d You say holding up your hands. The ECS members do not put down their guard just because you are though.\n\n\u201cEven if any of us did know such a woman, what makes you think we\u2019d tell you?\u201d the most aggressive ECS member says.\n\u201cLook, if you haven\u2019t heard of her, fine, I made a mistake and I\u2019ll just go.\u201d\n\u201cOh you made a mistake alright just by walking in this place and the only place you\u2019re going is the sewers after we dump your body!\u201d\n\nThe man suddenly grabs your arm and attempts to pull you towards him in order to stab you, but as soon as he grabs your arm he pulls his hand back. You draw your weapon and everyone steps back a bit.\n\n\u201cSHIT! This guy is fucking freezing!\u201d the man exclaims.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sorcerer! Quick, shoot him before he unleashes more frost magic!\u201d another shouts.\n\nSoon another man with a partially shaved head and a huge black claw tattooed on the shaved part appears from the back of the crowd.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, everyone fucking settle down. Obviously the man didn\u2019t come here to fight, he wants information, but that\u2019s going to cost. I trust you have some coin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, hope you don\u2019t mind it cold.\u201d You say and toss a small pouch of coins at him, which he catches.\n\u201cFine with me, you bought yourself an audience. Come with me into my office.\u201d\n\nYou follow the man as the rest of them get out of your way. His \u201coffice\u201d is really just a more secluded table towards the back, but it serves its purpose. The pair of you sit down and you learn the man\u2019s name is Mantis.\n\n\u201cGeez, you really do give off the cold. Not sensing that you\u2019re a sorcerer though. You look human\u2026curse perhaps?\u201d Mantis asks.\n\u201cSomething like that, getting it taken care of.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cWell good luck with that iceman. In any case we\u2019re not here to talk about your condition, you were asking about a woman named Lisa. Now for some reason you came to a know Ebony Claw location to ask us specifically. So what makes you think we might know this woman? And a better description would help.\u201d\n\nYou give a physical description of her based on what you remember of what she looked like. It\u2019s almost a little concerning that you\u2019ve almost forgotten what she looks like, but you believe your description has sufficed and it\u2019s your additional information that you think that she may have joined the Ebony Claw Syndicate that gets attention.\n\n\u201cHmm, I see. So you\u2019re looking for your long lost girlfriend? Is that it? You sure she just didn\u2019t want any more to do with you? It happens you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain that isn\u2019t the case. We were on good terms before our\u2026separation which wasn\u2019t either of our faults. Look I already know she could have very well moved on or even be dead. If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll just deal with it, but one of the last things she was talking about was possibly joining you guys. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, but if she did join and she\u2019s still part of your organization, then I\u2019d just like to know so if I have to ask every EC member, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do until I get confirmation.\u201d\n\u201cWell, From what you\u2019ve told me, she doesn\u2019t sound like ECS material, but then maybe she got lucky and blew the right person\u2026(Sigh) Look, I can ask around, but I can\u2019t make any promises. Our organization is fucking huge you understand and I couldn\u2019t even tell you every member in this city, let alone anywhere else. Shit, for all I know she might be a higher rank than me because I\u2019m nowhere near the top of the food chain. And if that\u2019s the case then I can\u2019t just be giving away her location and I\u2019m also not doing this for free.\u201d\n\u201cI just paid you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you paid for an audience with me. Now you\u2019re going to pay for me to ask around about your ex. However, I\u2019m not going to ask you for money. I want you to perform a task for me.\u201d\n\u201cA task?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. If I\u2019m going to potentially be giving information out one of our members to a stranger, I want to see just how dedicated you are about this. Now you look like you\u2019d be able to handle yourself in a fight. You came in here by yourself after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to go rob a bank or steal something?\u201d\n\u201cPfft. The syndicate has no need to be involved in such petty activities to supplement our income. The Blue Dream trade is thriving and whores and gambling are too. No, what needs to be done is something a lot more violent. You familiar with Karn?\u201d\n\u201cThe God of warriors?\u201d\n\u201cCombat, strength, all that related shit. Well their priests are starting to become a pain in the ass by encroaching on our territory.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware the Karnites were into drugs, whores and gambling.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t, but they\u2019re in the business of faith and that\u2019s a problem to the Temple of Fel. Not long ago, a Karnites broke all the limbs of one of Fel\u2019s faithful. This can\u2019t go unpunished. I want you to go kill the asshole and bring me back the ring he wears on his hand as proof.\u201d\n\nYou always heard rumors that the Ebony Claw Syndicate were more than just a criminal organization and the reasons why they were so powerful were due to their ties to the God of shadows. Looks like this confirms such things.\n\n\u201cOkay. So why send me? The syndicate has loads of assassins I\u2019d wager. In fact don\u2019t the followers of Fel specialize in that sort of thing?\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019d be right, but we just got finished with a full blown war with the Thieves Guild and the other petty organizations. We\u2019re really not looking to get into another one so soon without rebuilding a bit. As for the Fels themselves, well apparently it\u2019s not high on their priority list, but you can bet that if it did get taken care of, those involved would find favor with the temple.\u201d Mantis says with a smile.\n\nObviously Mantis wants to use you to advance his own petty ambitions.\n\u201cIn any case, you\u2019re not affiliated with us and you\u2019re not a follower of Fel. If you purposely start a fight with a Karnite and kill him then it has the added bonus of not being attached to either of us.\u201d Mantis continues.\n\u201cWait, you want me to just kill this guy out in the open?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not too familiar with the Karnite faith are you? Issue a personal challenge and it\u2019s all perfectly fine. Hell, even the city watch isn\u2019t going to do shit about it. Other Karnites themselves won\u2019t even retaliate, as they\u2019ll see it as an honorable challenge from a lone challenger. Though to be on the safe side, I\u2019d try to make it seem like a natural challenge. I dunno, bump into him on the street and pick a fight or something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the ring? Won\u2019t they be upset about me taking a holy item?\u201d\n\u201cEh, well they probably won\u2019t be happy about it, however you\u2019d be taking a trophy and if someone wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep it, then in their eyes they don\u2019t deserve it. In fact, they may even ask if you want to join them\u2026but obviously I wouldn\u2019t advise that.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the job", "result": "If this is going to help you find Lisa, then this is what you\u2019re going to have to do.\n\n\u201cOkay fine.

As befitting of a follower of Karn, he is constantly training his body and you can see him running laps in the area close to his temple early in the morning.\n\nBefore you leave, Mantis tells you that he\u2019ll look into finding out all he can about Lisa and if she is in fact an Ebony Claw, he\u2019ll tell you how you can contact her providing that you\u2019re successful.\n\nThe next few days you spend scouting and spying on your target\u2019s activities. As expected he doesn\u2019t indulge in much. Most of his time is spent in the temple. He only occasionally leaves to purchase a few pieces of fruit, which he seems to enjoy. He doesn\u2019t exactly purchase them either, he just takes them from the poor fruit seller who is far too intimidated by the burly holy man to tell him not to.\n\nYou thought about picking a fight with him when he was taking one of his morning runs, but you believe this might be better.\n\nSo eventually you make your move.\n\n\u201cHey! Watch it! I was going for that apple!\u201d you say mildly bumping into the priest.\n\nThe priest looks at you with annoyance, but he doesn\u2019t make a hostile move towards you. In fact he backs off a bit, but he also doesn\u2019t give you the apple either.\n\n\u201cAre you fucking deaf? I said I WAS going for that apple!\u201d you say raising your voice.\n\u201cSir! There are many other apples to choose from! Please pick any of the others. They\u2019re all fresh I assure you!\u201d the fruit seller remarks nervously.\n\u201cI suggest you listen to the shopkeep.\u201d The Karnite priest says.\n\u201cPfft, I don\u2019t give a shit what fruit boy says, let alone you! You\u2019re one of those karnites aren\u2019t you? I can tell by your shitty brown robes. Supposed to be masters of combat or something. I\u2019m hardly impressed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to impress you, but if you would like a sample of my abilities, I would be more than willing to show you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right. And after I kick your ass, you\u2019ll get all your Karnite buddies after me.\u201d\n\u201cWith how you\u2019re boasting, I\u2019m surprised that would be a concern. However, we can make it a one on one contest as per the doctrines of our faith. No retaliation for whatever the outcome. This one and any of these onlookers can be witnesses.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026sure\u2026okay. Whatever you say.\u201d The fruit seller responds.\n\u201cI will say though, I\u2019m detecting magic emanating off of you. If you\u2019re a sorcerer of some sort, this agreement is off.\u201d The priest adds.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a sorcerer. This is just me. You backing out?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cNo, I just suppose this will make things more interesting. Though I hope you realize that when we do this, I don\u2019t intend on just\u2026in your words kicking your ass. Karn\u2019s honor demands no less that I end you permanently.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I wasn\u2019t planning on holding back either.\u201d\n\nYou pull your short sword and the priest adopts a defensive stance. He doesn\u2019t seem at all worried that you have a weapon. After a couple of swings, you find out why since he easily disarms you.\n\nWhen you attempt to go for your dagger, he grabs your wrist to stop you and punches you hard in the face. While it doesn\u2019t hurt as much as it would a \u201cnormal\u201d person, you still feel the impact. Despite your icy skin and emanation, the priest shows no signs that he\u2019s bothered by it. Though no doubt as one of the Karn\u2019s faithful he\u2019s trained himself to not feel pain like other people. This is very apparent when you actually land a couple of blows and he reacts about as much as you would, which is barely phasing him.\n\nYou may have had your battles with arguably more \u201cpowerful\u201d beings and creatures than this priest, but then there were other circumstances involved. You are learning first hand that the priests of Karn live up to their reputation. It\u2019s only due to your condition that you manage to stand as long as you do, but eventually he lands a really good punch and this time you go down to the ground.\n\nWith you on the ground, the priest immediately takes advantage by taking one of your legs and breaking it. You definitely feel the physical trauma of bone snapping through your skin, though thanks to your dulled senses you don\u2019t go into shock and you manage to swing your other leg as hard as you can and kick the priest in the side of the head. He isn\u2019t expecting that reaction and you catch him slightly off guard. He\u2019s temporarily dazed and lets go of your broken leg.\n\nIt isn\u2019t enough however, since you\u2019re still at a disadvantage with a broken leg. You finally manage to pull your dagger in a desperate attempt to even the odds.\n\nThe priest avoids your attempts at stabbing at him with your dagger from your prone position. Instead, he kicks your hand, followed by stomping on it, breaking your fingers.\n\nSensing that you\u2019re much more manageable prey now, the priest puts his foot to your neck and stomps on it. It\u2019s enough to crush your windpipe causing you to gasp for air, but your slow asphyxiation is put to an end when he breaks your neck with a couple more stomps.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Refuse the job", "result": "You aren\u2019t having any part in possibly getting caught up in some faction war. This Mantis guy doesn\u2019t seem reliable on if he can give you any useful information anyway.\n\n\u201cThank you for your time, but I\u2019m going to have to pass.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFine by me, but let me tell you this. Don\u2019t come back here again for any reason. If fact I\u2019d advise you not to ask the Syndicate for any help on this matter again. This was a one-time offer. Now leave.\u201d Mantis remarks.\n\nYou leave the Poison Blade Inn no closer to finding Lisa. You know Mantis warned you, but given that he admitted that even he didn\u2019t know every EC member, you toy with the idea of just simply asking elsewhere.\n\nYou spend most of the week at various gambling halls, brothels, seedy taverns and fighting arenas. Most of which are run by the Syndicate, but you don\u2019t find Lisa and the few people that are talkative enough have never heard of her. Eventually you start getting enough suspicious looks in the crowds that even you think you should stop while you\u2019re ahead.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019ve got another task, which is curing your condition. You eventually return to the Dornan temple hoping that their elder can help.\n\nThis time however, you\u2019re stopped before you even get inside.\n\n\u201cHey! I\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d a female voice says, as you\u2019re about to open the door.\n\nYou turn around and see a young female Dornan priestess in the usual blue and purple robes.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re that pale guy that was talking to Travis and Mathias last week. I remember being surprised that Travis didn\u2019t throw you out immediately. You here to see him? Because he hasn\u2019t been around since that time, him or Mathias in fact. We\u2019ve sort of been wondering where he is, well not really for our sake since it\u2019s been peaceful without him, but Elder Flynn isn\u2019t going to like him being gone for so long since Travis was supposed to unofficially be in charge while he was in meditation.\u201d\n\u201cWait, your Elder, he isn\u2019t STILL in meditation is he?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it should only be a couple days before he\u2019s done. Did you need to see him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Travis told me to come back in a week so I could see him to possibly cure my condition.\u201d\n\nThe female priestess looks at you a bit before replying.\n\n\u201cHmm, yes I have noticed that you\u2019re giving off a small cold draft along with your pale skin. Uh\u2026I probably shouldn\u2019t do this, but um\u2026you MIGHT not want to meet Elder Flynn.\u201d She says.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell\u2026don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m a dedicated worshipper of Dorna and all her wisdom and mysteries of magic yet to be uncovered, but Elder Flynn is a bit on the radical side of uncovering some mysteries and acquiring knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d\n\u201cWell, meaning that you might find yourself entranced, on a table getting chopped up to see what exactly is causing this condition and how best that it can be harnessed. I mean it\u2019s also completely possible that won\u2019t happen, but I figured you should at least know the risk since I\u2019m sure Travis didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nYou take your hand off the door and sigh in defeat.\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how did this happen to you anyway?\u201d\n\nSince you don\u2019t have anything better to do now and she was kind enough to warn you, you go ahead and tell her. Heather as you learn her name listens intently to your story.\n\n\u201cRal huh? I wonder if that explains why Travis and Mathias lit out of here so quickly.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell you told them that Ral was dead meaning nobody is guarding that house anymore. The pair of them probably went over to loot the place of whatever magic they could find.\u201d\n\u201cOh shit. I wasn\u2019t thinking. Fuck! They\u2019ve probably completely stripped the place by now!\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference would it make to you? You don\u2019t use magic.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I AM still using that house as a residence and that\u2019s all my stuff now! Not to mention I was planning on selling some of that shit over time. I gotta get over there!\u201d\n\u201cWell hold on, you can\u2019t just face them alone! At least let me go with you so they don\u2019t turn you into a jackalope or something!\u201d\n\u201cFine, but keep up!\u201d\n\nYou soon make your way out of Holgard and back to your house. You never thought you\u2019d consider it your house, but hell after all the shit you put up with there and killing Ral for it, you feel you\u2019re entitled to it more than two asshole wizard priests just looting the place.\n\nHeather tells you that you\u2019d get there faster if you let her cast a haste spell on the pair of you. You\u2019re a little reluctant at first given your past with wizards, but eventually you give in and by the end of the day, you\u2019re back at your house. You see that the front door is wide open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to murder the pair of these thieves.\u201d You say (The irony isn\u2019t lost on you given your past)\n\u201cH\u2026hey wait! You can\u2019t just kill them!\u201d\n\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t, I killed one wizard already and I doubt if these two are more powerful than Ral.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not, but there\u2019s two of them and besides all that, they might be assholes but they\u2019re still my Dornan brothers! I understand your anger, but I\u2019m not going to just stand by and let you kill them. Look let me just go in first and talk to them.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like this at all, but you\u2019ve rather not have to fight three wizards so you relent.\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\nHeather goes in and you follow. Though you don\u2019t get very far inside when you see blood all over the floor. You then see a body.\n\n\u201cMathias!\u201d Heather shouts and goes over to him. You look at Mathias\u2019 body and see a couple of chunks bitten from his body along with several quills in him.\n\n\u201cShit, I can\u2019t believe I forgot he was still here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWho\u2019s still here?!\u201d Heather exclaims.\n\u201cSpikey.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cMy pet manticore.\u201d\n\u201cWait. You have a pet manticore?\n\u201cSure, doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell do you forget something like that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a busy week and I\u2019ve had a couple of more important things on my mind. Also I thought I left him outside, though maybe I did and he wandered in when your people broke in. I hope these assholes didn\u2019t hurt him.\u201d You say and follow the other trail of blood leading to the lab door, which is open.\n\nYou look around the lab and see some equipment knocked over along with some quills embedded in various places. You see another body on the floor though this one is almost completely eaten and it\u2019s mostly just bones now. You imagine that this is probably Travis.\n\nSpikey (who is a little larger than when you last saw him) is here gnawing on one of these bones and sees you. He growls a bit at first, but then comes up to you. And you cautiously give him a pet.\n\n\u201cHave you actually gotten bigger already? And what are these things?\u201d you say and also notice little nubs on his back that weren\u2019t there before.\n\u201cThose are the beginnings of wings.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\nSpikey sees her and immediately raises his tail up until you start to try to calm him down.\n\n\u201cHeather you can\u2019t just sneak up like that! He\u2019s not that friendly around strangers!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cObviously, but I\u2019m not fussed.\u201d Heather remarks and then waves her hands a bit and she goes up to Spikey and pets him who is suddenly very friendly towards her.\n\u201cHmm, apparently your buddies didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d\n\u201cMight\u2019ve caught Travis off guard, if he was looting this place he probably wasn\u2019t focusing on anything else. Then I imagine Mathias panicked since he\u2019s always been prone to do that and tried to run away which didn\u2019t work of course.\u201d\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, but you don\u2019t seem too concerned about your fellow priests like you were a moment ago.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Travis I never gave a shit about. Matthias was okay, but he didn\u2019t exactly have the strongest of backbone. If he did, he might still be alive. Plus how they died was on them. I mean it isn\u2019t like you killed them in cold blood. They were looting your home and your guard creature killed them because they weren\u2019t wise enough to assess the dangers before hand. I can accept that.\u201d\n\u201cVery pragmatic of you.\u201d\n\u201cDorna does teach us the virtues of pragmatism. Speaking of which, I have pragmatic proposition for you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\n\nHeather asks if she can look through Ral\u2019s stuff and take some of it. She explains that in exchange for doing so, she can try to look into your condition personally and try to figure out how to reverse it.\n\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t I suppose. All I can give you is my word and hopefully my actions today have given you something to judge my character. I may be a worshipper of Dorna, but I\u2019m not a fanatic like the Elder. Also, there is no point in telling him about his old acquaintance Ral being dead. Not when I can come here and use the knowledge found here myself.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cAh, so do you plan to usurp your Elder?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, but one never knows about the future. In any case, your condition is intriguing enough for me to try to look into. I promise I won\u2019t attempt anything too invasive unless you agree to it.\u201d\n\u201cHow chivalrous of you. (Sigh) Yeah, I guess I\u2019ll trust you, for now at least. What about your Dornan brothers?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just say I haven\u2019t seen them and have no idea where they are. I might warn you however that other Dornan members have probably seen you given that you\u2019ve been around and inside the temple. A few of them might have even seen you speaking with Travis. Might be best if you lay low for awhile and not even go to Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be right, but I can\u2019t promise anything. I\u2019m sort of looking for someone there\u2026but then they might be dead or gone anyway. Yeah I guess I can stay out of sight and make other arrangements.\u201d\n\nHeather and you come to an agreement and she proceeds to look through the lab. She actually doesn\u2019t take much, just a few books that you have no use for anyway. She says that she\u2019ll be back as soon as she can and next time she comes by she\u2019ll look into your condition.\n\nIn the meantime you spend time at your home not really doing much of anything except a lot of contemplation. You think about how you probably won\u2019t ever see Lisa again, but you also think about your family and how they might be doing. Did Annah survive? Where is your sister and what is she doing right now? Is she okay?\n\nAll of these people that were once important in your life are just not around anymore and you doubt if you\u2019ll ever see them again either. Even if you weren\u2019t in the condition you\u2019re in now, you couldn\u2019t return home with how you left it anyway.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually expect Heather to return or if she does she\u2019ll return with a group of other wizards to end you, which you barely even care about at this point, but she eventually does return and it\u2019s alone.\n\nShe subjects you to a few minor tests that she can think of to do and even gives you a few potions to drink. You agree to it mainly because you don\u2019t have much to lose. None of the potions work however save for a couple actually making you sick and causing you to vomit.\n\n\u201cApologies, but I can\u2019t think of anything else to do that isn\u2019t more invasive.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. Ugh. Maybe\u2026maybe we can do that another day though. Not feeling too well right now. Take whatever you like from the lab, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more shit you could find useful. I\u2019m not going to Holgard to sell any of it any time soon.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just going to lay down for awhile. Remember to lock the door on your way out.\u201d\n\nHeather\u2019s a little surprised by your permissiveness given that you were ready to kill two of her fellow priests for being here not long ago, but your consent is what makes all the difference. That and the fact that you\u2019re still feeling a little depressed about things on top of not feeling well physically.\n\nYou get into bed and sleep, when you wake up. You find a note with a bottle next to it on a nearby table. It\u2019s from Heather telling you that the contents should make you feel better since it\u2019s a healing potion of sorts. You down the liquid and it starts to work.\n\nHeather also says she isn\u2019t sure when the next time she\u2019ll be back, but she\u2019ll try to make it as soon as she can.\n\nWell it seems like you can trust this Heather at least along with her being someone that can actually help you or try to, which means it\u2019s a start.\n\nWho knows if any of this will help or change things though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked through ALL of Ral\u2019s writings along with researching various tomes we have at the temple and I can\u2019t figure out exactly WHAT he did to you. I mean I can guess what he did, but even if I\u2019m right, I still have no idea how to reverse it.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\nYou know Heather\u2019s done more than you ever expected from her, but you can\u2019t help but feel frustrated by all this. If your condition wasn\u2019t getting worse, it probably would be tolerable, but it is getting worse. Not so much for you in terms of life and death directly, but you\u2019re starting to effect things in a wider area.\n\nAt this point your home is freezing to most (or at least to Heather when she visits) and frost covers everything you come in contact with now. You don\u2019t even have to touch it for long.\n\nEven Spikey makes his home outside the house rather than inside, though it\u2019s just as well since he\u2019s huge now.\n\nWhich is leading to the other issue and that\u2019s the fact your icy home is starting to look very out of place compared to the rest of the surrounding landscape. Granted you\u2019re isolated from most major population centers, but there is Dert. Dert is close enough that it\u2019s only going to take a few of the more adventurous young folks to go wandering from that backwards village and bring back tales of an \u201cIce Castle\u201d with a manticore guarding it. (Fortunately Spikey has never wandered towards Dert and his hunting grounds are mainly elsewhere.)\n\nHeather herself has been trying to keep your presence a secret since apparently Elder Flynn has been sensing a minor growth in magical energy in the area. So far he assumes it\u2019s Ral just working on something, but Heather stresses that if he finds out the truth, he\u2019ll definitely be heading to your home.\n\nHeather is also stressed out due to the fact that she\u2019s been keeping all this from her comrades and on top of everything else, there\u2019s the beginning of religious faction war going on in Holgard.\n\nSince she\u2019s out of any ideas that you might find acceptable, she suggests the last thing she can think of and that\u2019s that you leave and head north. She believes your condition is exaggerated by the warmer climate. (Even more so now due to it being a hotter summer than usual) While you\u2019ve sort of guessed that to some extent, she thinks that if you were just constantly living in a colder environment, your condition would even out and you might not attract as much attention.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026what then? I\u2019m supposed to just go live on a mountain top somewhere?\u201d you say.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just saying that you could probably live some place colder and your condition not be as much of a problem. You\u2019d at least blend in a bit better. As it stands now, you\u2019re starting to attract a lot of attention and you were previously pretty isolated before. Not to mention you\u2019ve got a big ass manticore wandering around nearby. You stay here and you\u2019re probably going to have groups of hired adventurers beating down your door.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cYou just want me to leave because you\u2019re worried about your own ass.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right I am! I mean I\u2019m risking every time I come here, every time I lie to Elder Flynn. You realize how much my stomach is in knots about this? And you know what? Fuck you. I\u2019ve been helping you out trying to figure out how to cure you! I\u2019ve tried potions, spells, salves, rituals and even prayers to Dorna on your behalf!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve also been helping yourself to magical shit I have.\u201d\n\u201cSo? It\u2019s been mutually beneficial, but now it\u2019s starting to get risky to a point of where I\u2019m no longer comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I get it. I get it. But I\u2019m just not too keen on this idea that I\u2019m supposed to just pick up and leave.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I dunno any other solutions. I mean when was the last time you went to Holgard and didn\u2019t start drawing a crowd? Didn\u2019t you say that the guards actually prevented you from entering last time? You said you had to sneak in and then you soon got run out of there. I mean it\u2019s only going to be a matter of time that you start drawing the attention of someone you aren\u2019t going to be able to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cYour boss is really getting that suspicious huh?\u201d\n\u201cElder Flynn is a concern of course, but it might actually be lucky for you that there\u2019s religious strife going on in Holgard right now. But I was talking in general. Look, we\u2019ve gotten along for a while now, and maybe if circumstances were different I\u2019d say stick around longer, but\u2026\u201d\n\nHeather turns away from you a bit and exhales. In fact she starts to sniffle a bit.\n\n\u201cWhat? Wait a minute\u2026no\u2026really? You never gave any indication! Hell, we\u2019ve never even kissed! Though I suppose given my condition that might cause problems. That\u2019s why you never acted on it\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh trust me, there\u2019s ways we could have gotten around that aspect. A simple protection of cold would have done that. It\u2019s just\u2026 it could never really work okay? And yeah initially I was helping you because it was beneficial to me personally, but I did genuinely want to help because you seemed like an okay guy that was in a bad situation. Even with you telling me tales of your shady past, there was always a charm about you.\u201d Heather remarks wiping her eyes a bit.\n\u201cIf I ever run into my sister again, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be amused to hear that some of her charisma finally wore off on me. Well if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve had more than my fair share of thoughts about you as well.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean just the dirty ones though, I mean I figured even if you were only helping for the magic knowledge and items, it still was nice that someone was helping me.\u201d\n\u201cSort of wish you were only thinking of me in a dirty way, it would make this a lot easier. (Sigh) I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you have said something sooner, I mean now what am I supposed to do? Just leave, knowing all this?\u201d\n\u201cIf you do have feelings for me like you say then I beg you to leave because you\u2019ll just make it harder for me in the long run. I know it\u2019s selfish to put myself first, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not mad because I get it, but I don\u2019t see why WE can\u2019t just leave together. I mean you could continue trying to figure out how to cure me and you could probably start up another Dorna church up north and convert barbarian tribes or something. \u201d\n\u201cHeh, nice idea. Tempting even, but no. My life is here.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re getting frustrated at this point.\n\n\u201cWhat are you fucking this Elder Flynn or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! He\u2019s like a hundred years old and I don\u2019t have daddy issues!\u201d\n\u201cWell what\u2019s really keeping you here then?\u201d\n\u201cLook, maybe an infidel like you can\u2019t understand, but my temple is also my family and with all the trouble going on right now, I\u2019m not going to just abandon them.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you been hording knowledge and the shit you get from me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s a complicated family relationship.\u201d\n\u201cGuess I can\u2019t relate much\u2026(sigh) Okay, fine. I\u2019ll leave, but only because you did try to help me, I\u2019m a sucker for a pretty face and the fact I don\u2019t really have any other ties here and it\u2019ll make things easier for you.\u201d\n\nYou start to get ready to pack, but Heather stops you.\n\n\u201cHold on a second. You don\u2019t need to leave right this minute.\u201d She says and makes a few little hand gestures causing a brief blue glow around her.\n\nThen she kisses you. It doesn\u2019t feel as good as you remember the last time you did this with Lisa. Even the good stuff is dulled, but what the hell, you\u2019ll take it.\n\nYou and Heather get to it and you have a rather interesting time going about your intimacy. Heather\u2019s spell is working, but it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s still feeling some mild\u2026well the word isn\u2019t exactly discomfort, but let\u2019s just say she has never pleasured herself with an icicle in the past so it\u2019s a cool sensation down there for her.\n\nHowever she\u2019s a trooper and you must be doing something right because by the time you\u2019re done she\u2019s covered in frost. No, that\u2019s not a euphemism either; she\u2019s literally covered in frost.\n\n(In fact if this was all taking place in a modern setting, there could be a whole joke about \u201cThe Iceman Cometh\u201d)\n\nYou on the other hand were sort of hoping that experience while pleasant enough would maybe raise your body temperature a little, but no, you\u2019re still as cold as ever.\n\nAfter a moment of basking in frosty bliss, Heather brushes herself off and gets dressed.\n\n\u201cI hope that you can somehow find a way to cure yourself, but whether you do or not, take care okay?\u201d\n\nWith those last words she gives you one more kiss and leaves you alone.\n\nThis experience has arguably been the best thing that\u2019s happened to you since you woke up in your condition. Of course maybe you\u2019re just sort of feeling that way due to the fact that you haven\u2019t exactly been with anyone in a long damn time.\n\nPart of you wants to just go to her temple, but going to Holgard isn\u2019t going to do anything but cause problems for her and you, so you\u2019ll wait. You know she\u2019ll be back. You figure Heather will probably come back here in a couple days to see if you\u2019re still around and to potentially look for any items she may have missed. When she comes back, you\u2019ll make every effort to convince her to come with you.\n\nSo you wait. A week passes, then a month, then two months\u2026\n\nBy this time, you\u2019re still laboring under the delusion that she\u2019s going to come back and mainly subsisting on frozen berries, fruit and roots that you don\u2019t go too far to collect from your home.\n\nIn the meantime Spikey, being an apex predator in the area has steadily over the past few years been depleting most of the wildlife. He was also supplementing this with the many bandit groups that make their homes in the woods at times. However, even bandits eventually get wise to the fact that it might not be the best idea to have a hideout where many of their fellows are disappearing at an alarming rate.\n\nIf his attention wasn\u2019t in the direction of Dert before it is now.\n\nYou however don\u2019t really know any of this until you get a knock on the door one night. Thinking that it\u2019s Heather, you spring from your chair, and open it.\n\nAnd you\u2019re met by a woman, one you even know, but not Heather.\n\n\u201c\u2026Isabella?\u201d you say upon seeing her.\n\nIsabella frowns as you just stare at her naked body in surprise.\n\n\u201cGlad you remember what my tits look like.\u201d She says.\n\u201c\u2026Apologies, but I really wasn\u2019t expecting you. I thought another\u2026nevermind, what are you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to speak to Ral\u2026what the hell happened to you? You\u2019re as pale as I am and you\u2019re giving off some serious cold. This whole house is, given the frost and ice in the area. What the hell IS Ral doing in there?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, no offense, but I\u2019m not in the mood to speak to his magic slave. I want you to go bring his ass out of his lab to come speak to me right now. I mean I thought we had an understanding at least that if we HAD to be neighbors he wouldn\u2019t fuck things up for me. Now I got a bunch of dead people in Dert due to his escaped manticore or pet or experiment or whatever the fuck. I told him that backwards dung heap of a hamlet was MY ongoing food source and was not to be messed with.\u201d\n\u201cWait, Spikey attacked Dert?\u201d\n\u201cSpikey? That its name? Real original. But yeah it was a damn blood bath there. Hell, I could smell it even from my crypt. The beast killed ten people. I would have tracked it down easily, but considering its scent was also leading in this direction, I\u2019d pay Ral a visit first since I was sure this was all his fault. And judging from what I\u2019m seeing, I was right. So get his ass out here!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a problem given that he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cDead? Bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. He\u2019s been dead for like two years now.\u201d\n\nNow Isabella is the one showing some surprise. The fact that she is surprised means you must have really caught he off guard. You remember that Ral and her had a relationship in the past. From some of her brief sad expression, she perhaps didn\u2019t have complete loathing for him.\n\nIsabella looks down a bit and closes her eyes before speaking again.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Damn. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d still feel something for the bastard, but I guess you never know until it happens. I guess this means you\u2019re no longer a magic slave and you\u2019re in fact responsible for this mess then. How? You\u2019re no wizard. And how did you kill Ral anyway?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Ral, he just died of natural causes in his bed.\u201d You quickly say.\n\u201cHah! Nice try, but you\u2019re lying. Look, I don\u2019t care if you killed him, if he\u2019d made me a slave I\u2019d have killed him too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I had help and it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. So what\u2019s with the eternal winter here?\u201d\n\u201cRal\u2019s last gift to me.\u201d\n\nYou give a quick explanation of events of your condition to Isabella who listens to everything.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026it was this Heather was the one you were waiting for then?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cYeah, but well\u2026that\u2019s a long story.\u201d You say with a sigh.\n\u201cLet me guess you fell for your nurse.\u201d\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a nurse, she was a priestess.\u201d\n\u201cNurse, priestess, whore, doesn\u2019t matter. Your circumstance is as old as time. You fell for the one taking care of you when nobody else would. It happens a lot, but I think your case its just desperation.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been waiting for this girl for two months you said. It\u2019s obvious she isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\u201cShe could just be busy! There\u2019s a religious war going on in Holgard right now! You know, we made love the last time I saw her!\u201d\n\u201cAnd? That probably was just a goodbye pity fuck. Look, I didn\u2019t see how you two interacted and I\u2019m only getting some of what you\u2019re telling me, so I\u2019m not going to say this girl didn\u2019t have feelings for you, but its obvious she cares more about herself or at least her own life.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u201d you snap.\n\u201cOkay, look, whatever. I actually don\u2019t care that much, but we still need to settle this issue with your pet manticore along with your snowman condition because both of them are going to fuck up my shit. The manticore can be settled easily since I can just kill the beast and be done with it. But you are a whole other problem.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute you can\u2019t just kill my pet! And why the hell am I a problem, I don\u2019t even go near Dert.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but your aura might. I mean from what little you\u2019ve told me, your condition is getting worse and if that\u2019s the case, the last thing I need is for it to freeze over Dert and cause all the peasants there to pick up and leave due to failed crops. It\u2019s bad enough some are already talking about leaving due to the manticore attack. Others are even talking about hiring adventurers. Last thing I need is a group of fortune seekers stomping around the area and stumbling on my place of rest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be able to handle them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the damn point, my point is I like things peaceful and they can\u2019t be, if there are certain elements in the area fucking everything up! So the way I see it, is you got two choices. You either leave, or I cure you.\u201d\n\nOnce again Isabella has given you a little surprise.\n\n\u201cWhat? You can cure me? How?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cInvite me in and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Isabella responds with a smile.\n\u201cUh\u2026no\u2026things aren\u2019t quite bad enough for me to want to commit suicide.\u201d\n\u201cWho said I was going to kill you? I\u2019d make you into a vampire.\u201d\n\u201cWait. Why? Would that work?\u201d\n\u201cSure. The transformation process practically gives you a clean slate. I\u2019d be very surprised if it didn\u2019t work. As for why\u2026well let\u2019s just say why not?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I feel like there\u2019s a catch\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell of course there\u2019s a catch, I don\u2019t just offer the gift to anyone. I\u2019d require you to help me around the crypt as it were.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is.\n\n\u201cA slave. You want me to be your slave.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be a slave, you\u2019d be my\u2026companion. You think your few years of no meaningful intimacy are bad? Come back when you\u2019ve had a century or so of it. I just felt a pang of loss over a man that I practically loathed for decades. Now I know I\u2019m moving in quick on you, but when you\u2019ve been as solitary as I have, you tend to not let social rules dictate your actions. I\u2019m offering not only a cure for your condition and immortality, but also a chance for you not to worry about having to be alone ever again. You can\u2019t say you aren\u2019t tempted. I still remember that night we had years ago. Look, I\u2019ll be back in a couple nights. If you\u2019re still here, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019ve accepted my offer. If you\u2019re gone, I know you haven\u2019t. And when I say I\u2019ll be back in a couple nights, you can bet that I\u2019ll mean it.\u201d Isabella says and leaves.\n\nAnd once again you\u2019re left alone with a big decision. You knew you were going to have to make one soon, but these events haven\u2019t definitely given you more to think about.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay and accept the offer", "result": "It\u2019s not a perfect solution, in fact it might very well be worse, but you see no other option. Maybe you just don\u2019t even care anymore. Ever since you left Teckleville, you\u2019ve been confined somehow. Ral did it directly with the geas, then even in death he did it with this condition he forced upon you. Now it would appear Isabella is planning to do the same. She claims that you\u2019ll be her companion, but you really don\u2019t get the impression that you\u2019ll be equal. Not really. Hell, maybe in some twisted way you want someone else giving the orders and that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to do this.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter; you just can\u2019t deal with being like this any longer. At least this way you\u2019ll have someone on your side on a regular basis. Of course maybe you\u2019re just deluding yourself and hoping for something that isn\u2019t there. Just like you did when you waited for Heather. Again, it doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going to go through with this plan because it\u2019s the easiest way out.\n\nSo you wait, and in the next two nights, you hear a knock on the door. You open it and as expected it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cWell, given that you\u2019re here, I\u2019d say that means you\u2019ve decided to take me up on my offer. I have to say, this pleases me and you will soon see just how lucky you are that I chose you. Now, if you\u2019ll just invite me in, we can get to this, or you can step out here, if you prefer. Up to you.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cMight as well come in. My home is your home now.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, but I\u2019m sure you realize that we\u2019ll be living at my superior home\u2026however I suppose this isn\u2019t a bad place to use as a surface dwelling of sorts. Always was curious about what it looked like inside. Though I\u2019m guessing there wasn\u2019t frost all over the place.\u201d Isabella remarks as she enters and gives a brief glance around before turning to you.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026are you ready to ascend a higher form of existence?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cUm\u2026yes\u2026but I just have a question.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course. I can answer all your concerns about this process.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually about Spikey.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was wondering what was going to happen with him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you want to happen to him?\u201d\n\u201cWell considering I\u2019m going along with all this, I\u2019d like to request that you not kill him. I mean as a vampire couldn\u2019t you just charm the beast to not attack Dert?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t work forever. The beast could shake off the effects when it\u2019s out in the wild at any time. I can\u2019t be expected to keep up on it and before you volunteer to do it, you aren\u2019t going to have the time either. Even if we managed to keep the beast from attacking the village, there\u2019s still the issue that he\u2019s probably killing all the wildlife in the area, which could actually have worse effects in the long run. He really doesn\u2019t belong here.\u201d\n\u201cIs there nothing that can be done? I mean I get that you don\u2019t have an attachment to him, but he did save my life once.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I can see that you\u2019re more attached to this animal than I thought\u2026very well I suppose I understand. There\u2019s another solution, but you\u2019re going to have to still be prepared to say goodbye to him.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ll take him some place else to live that\u2019s why. We can make a trip out of it or something I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I guess that\u2019s reasonable. Thanks.\u201d\n\u201cWell I am the reasonable one. So, you ready?\u201d\n\u201cI guess as much as I\u2019m going to be, now you\u2019re sure this is going to work?\u201d\n\u201cI have no doubt that it won\u2019t, now come to me and let me warm you up.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s statement is more of a turn of a phrase considering her own undead ass is as cold as a grave, but then she probably is still warmer than you are.\n\nYou approach Isabella who embraces you in her arms. She doesn\u2019t flinch from your icy body and instead kisses you on your lips. You wish you weren\u2019t so numb that you could actually enjoy this bit.\n\nEventually she stops kissing you and her mouth roams a bit lower and to the side. This is it.\n\nYou feel a sharp sensation enter your neck (which doesn\u2019t cause you pain) followed by a draining one. Isabella herself is having a mildly difficult time sucking your blood, which is probably a little slushy due to your frosty condition, but she\u2019s getting through it.\n\nSoon light headiness follows and then you\u2019re starting to lose consciousness altogether.\n\nJust before you do though, Isabella stops feeding on you and then quickly bites herself on the wrist. Using the open wound, she pours some of her blood into your own mouth and a metallic taste hits your tongue and eventually slides down your throat.\n\n\u201cYou just made the best decision in your mortal life\u2026 now experience ascension.\u201d Isabella remarks and then kisses you on the mouth again before finishing you off.\n\nEverything goes dark.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time passes, but when you wake up, you\u2019re feeling quite different. You\u2019re not breathing, and you\u2019re hungry. You\u2019re still cold, but now it\u2019s changed. You\u2019re no longer a walking glacier.\n\nIt worked, but now what? And where are you?\n\nYou look around and find that you\u2019re no longer in your home. You\u2019re lying on a stone floor for one thing. There\u2019s no light, but you aren\u2019t finding that to be a problem since now you have some sort of night vision.\n\nYou also see two human figures shackled to the walls. They\u2019re both naked and have their heads hanging down. You sense that they\u2019re still alive, but they aren\u2019t struggling so you can only assume they\u2019re either so demoralized that don\u2019t have the desire, or they\u2019re under control in some way.\n\n\u201cGood, right on time for you to be awake. So, how do you feel? Hungry I suspect. Well you can have one of those two on the wall, Don\u2019t completely drain them though, I like to keep them around awhile, saves me from having to go out as often\u2026though with you around now, I guess I hopefully won\u2019t have to do that anymore at all.\u201d Isabella remarks while standing in an entryway.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything; you just slowly get up as you\u2019re still feeling a little strange. Isabella goes over to help you.\n\n\u201cHere, I got you. Let\u2019s get you over to the food, you\u2019ll feel much better I think after you eat. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a very basic process, and I\u2019ll guide you through it, then afterwards we can do some other things that are also very basic. I\u2019m sure that will be fun for the both of us.\u201d\n\nIsabella guides you over to the human wretch that\u2019s chained up and tells you where to bite so you don\u2019t just kill the person right away. She\u2019s right of course, it is all very easy. Hell, you don\u2019t even hesitate with doing it. Why you don\u2019t is probably a combination of several factors. If anything you feel like you\u2019re in a daze right now and Isabella is taking the lead. While its entirely possible that she\u2019s got some sort of control over you, it\u2019s more along the lines that you\u2019re just perfectly willing to let her take the lead.\n\nShe promised exactly what she said, she cured you. Why be ungrateful or defiant? Why fight what is now your nature, which is to feed on other living beings\u2019 blood? You ultimately chose this, so you might as well embrace it.\n\nIf this makes you completely \u201cevil\u201d now, you really don\u2019t give a shit. You were dancing on the edge of it anyway, and that didn\u2019t even work out very well. Maybe now that you\u2019ve completely crossed over, maybe things will start going a lot better for you.\n\nThe fact that you and Isabella soon have a round of passionate bloody vampire sex soon after you\u2019re done feeding can only mean things are in fact improving for you\u2026\n\nRight?", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 26\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how things can be going fairly well for you, and you\u2019ll still find shit to be dissatisfied about.\n\nWhat might be worse is the new nature of you \u201cconfinement.\u201d It\u2019s another gilded cage. (Or fancy crypt in this case.) While not much is ever demanded of you, Isabella definitely is treating you less than equal as you have to clean the crypt\n\nOne thing you never knew about vampires is how they can become obsessed with the smallest details. Probably has to do with the enhanced senses. Isabella apparently is a neat freak and due to this quirk she spent most of her time rearranging, cleaning, and generally tidying up her home. An impossible task of course, but that didn\u2019t stop her from trying.\n\nEven the room where she keeps the blood \u201cdonors\u201d is kept clean and isn\u2019t the slaughterhouse that one would expect it to be.\nShe still cleans of course, but you\u2019re doing most of it now. It\u2019s really boring especially since you had to do this to a lesser degree at Ral\u2019s and at least there, you were able to let it go for a week at times. Not to mention it\u2019s fucking impossible to \u201cclean\u201d a vast underground crypt in the first place.\n\nAbout the only thing you don\u2019t have to take care of is her underground garden, which is her own personal project that she spends a lot of time on. In fact, with you around now she doesn\u2019t even have to leave it to get food much anymore. She just has you do that, which is sort of plus, since that\u2019s one of two major things that break up the monotony.\n\nYou initially would lure a citizen of Dert back to the crypt, but in time you started wandering a bit more and realized with all the bandits making hideouts in forest, you might as well give yourself a bit more of a challenge.\n\nSometimes you will boldly face a group of them. The poor dumb bastards never realize they don\u2019t have a chance and you proceed to tear them apart, satisfying your own hunger and leaving only one or two alive to bring back to Isabella.\n\nThe second major thing would be your routine intimacy with Isabella. It\u2019s a little odd, mainly because you\u2019ve got mixed feelings on the emotional side of things. Isabella is very comfortable with the physical aspect, but in a lot of ways she\u2019s still pretty distant. Makes a bit hard for you to return serious affection when you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re just there as a dick for her to use when she\u2019s in the mood.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t really have any real complaints about that aspect that might make this bit of \u201ccaptivity\u201d worse since it\u2019s really difficult to complain when you\u2019re getting quality sex thrown in your direction on a regular basis.\n\nBut since you\u2019re not totally whipped, you\u2019re going to complain anyway. Not to mention you just need more to occupy your time. There has to be more than just feeding and fucking, especially since you\u2019re supposed to be immortal now.\n\nThough you\u2019d be lying if you weren\u2019t worried, she IS vastly more powerful than you after all and can easily subvert your free will if she so desired. (She never has though)\n\nYou wait for one of the rare moments that she isn\u2019t in her private garden to speak with her since even after a year she still doesn\u2019t allow you in there.\n\n\u201cOh, hello. Have you been waiting out here for me the whole time?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cSort of. Oh I brought back dinner. A couple of children from Dert this time. I know it\u2019s risky since it causes more hysteria in the locals when kids go missing, but I was very careful and I figured you deserved something special.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cMmm, you\u2019re always so doting. Well, with your news and the fact I finally got my deathshade growing properly, I\u2019m in a good mood tonight, so we can do that thing you always want to do to me after I eat.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah that\u2019s something to look forward to, but I was actually here to speak to you about something that\u2019s been on my mind lately.\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay then.\u201d\n\u201cNow I\u2019m already prepared for you to say no, but I want to make my argument clear\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what is it?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get mad\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up and get to your point, I guarantee I\u2019m going to start getting mad. Just fucking say it already!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! I want more freedom.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow hold on, I don\u2019t mean I want to leave you! I just\u2026agh\u2026I need more out of life, or unlife as it were.\u201d\n\u201cMore? You have all you need. A home, a nearby food source, a beautiful companion by your side. I mean I\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all great. Really it is. Probably better than I ever could have stumbled upon. It\u2019s like\u2026well okay here\u2019s a good example. You have that garden. That garden that you love to spend all, occupying your free time when you have it. I mean you don\u2019t even let me in there, so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s something pretty special to you. I guess I\u2019m saying I need my own garden. Not literally of course.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, I understand what you\u2019re saying\u2026I suppose I have just taken your happiness for granted.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I am happy, I just need something more to do and no offense, but cleaning this crypt isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\u201cHah, well I figured. I\u2019d hoped that you would have developed a bit of an obsession for it like I somewhat did, but I imagine your servitude to Ral might have dampened that. Okay, so you\u2019re basically saying you want a hobby, fine. But I wasn\u2019t exactly stopping you from getting one. So what did you have in mind exactly?\u201d\n\nWell so far this is going better than you thought, though Isabella\u2019s question brings up the fact that perhaps you haven\u2019t thought this entirely through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m not exactly sure\u2026I was sort of expecting you to be against it. Okay, well anyway I\u2019ve been killing bandits in the forests. Lots of them actually.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI figured you must have found some other food source since you didn\u2019t often eat here. So you have a bit of the bloodlust do you? That can happen with new vampires. As long as you don\u2019t massacre Dert, I don\u2019t care what you do.\u201d Isabella responds.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to go to Holgard once in awhile.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t before? Again, I assumed when you weren\u2019t feeding much here, you might be nipping off to Holgard to eat.\u201d\n\u201cI sort of wasn\u2019t sure if you wanted me to go that far.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, do I really come off of that controlling? Holgard isn\u2019t that far. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a lowly human anymore that is going to take forever and a day to walk there. With your speed, you could go there and be back before dawn. Hell, if you really needed to, it wouldn\u2019t bother me if you stayed there for a few nights. Get it all out of your system. If culling a few extra humans to satisfy your bloodlust is what you need to do, well Holgard couldn\u2019t be a better place to do it. It\u2019s a crime-ridden city where murder occurs daily. You\u2019d fit right in and never arouse suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but it\u2019s not just the killing, it\u2019s I used to be a rogue before all this happened...and I\u2019ve been thinking on those days I do miss them.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what then? You want to go to Holgard to be a common thief?\u201d\n\u201cWell when you say it like that, it doesn\u2019t sound as impressive. It\u2019s more like I just wonder if my desire for it is still there or am I just missing something from a simpler time I guess.\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you doing it during your time with Ral? I know he didn\u2019t keep you on that short of a leash.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I was so miserable that I don\u2019t think I ever really enjoyed it most of the time. About the only time I did, was when I was training\u2026um\u2026another\u2026\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s eyebrow raises as you stop yourself from mentioning Lisa. You quickly change up the conversation a bit.\n\n\u201cMy point is, I haven\u2019t really gotten to enjoy doing it since I left Teckleville. Actually even before that, since I started enjoying it less after my sister left. However, I feel like I should give it one more go to see if it really was something I liked doing, or maybe I just liked doing it with someone who was also interested in it.\u201d\n\u201cYou actually may find such petty thievery much too easy now. After all you have powers that you didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but I also can\u2019t just break into any old house either not being invited and all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but that can be easily gotten around if you can charm the owner into letting you in. There are also public buildings of course like shops. In any case, if this is something you want to pursue, I\u2019m not going to deny you your eccentricities. We all have our interests. I believe this may be left over longings for your old human life, which is natural for new vampires as well. I also think you\u2019ll get bored eventually, but I leave you to work through it. Anyway, was that it?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah basically.\u201d\n\u201cGood, now I\u2019m going to feed on these children you got me, and then we can do that other things. Fairly certain you aren\u2019t going to go anywhere tonight.\u201d\n\nWell she\u2019s right about that.\n\nThe next night you make your way to Holgard and it\u2019s true, thanks to your supernatural speed you get there fairly quickly, you don\u2019t even catch the attention of the guards outside the gate.\n\nYou haven\u2019t been here in so long; you never thought you\u2019d actually miss it. Hasn\u2019t really changed at all though there is one thing you\u2019re noticing and that\u2019s the fact the streets are practically empty. Its not even that late, usually there\u2019s still more activity than this. You see the watch patrolling around, but they\u2019re in groups much larger than you remember. They also tend to eye you very suspiciously.\n\nGranted you\u2019re here for trouble, but you decide that it probably isn\u2019t the best idea if you start off by murdering several Holgard Watchmen so you start avoiding said groups.\n\nIt occurs to you that something here has changed drastically. Last time you heard any news of this place was Heather and she told you there was a war brewing between the religious factions. Maybe things have gotten worse?\n\nIn any case you decide to eat first and head to the lower class districts where there are less patrols and probably easier to get a quick meal.\n\nYou roam the streets, but it looks like even the lower elements have tried to set up some sort of safety plan during this uncertain time. Bums and the like are lingering together. Whores are as well and even performing their trade in groups. The worst part is instead of the Watch, there are Ebony Claw Syndicate members patrolling around and they\u2019re probably even more diligent since some of the ECS are also Fel followers.\n\nYou soon realize that you\u2019re probably going to have to just enter a tavern and just lure someone away and get them in private or just risk the attention and wipe out a small group as quick as possible. Actually you\u2019re keener on the second idea since you\u2019re getting a bit impatient with how inconvenient this has been.\n\nJust as you\u2019re turning a corner a man in a green robe literally runs into you. It\u2019s enough to cause you to stagger since you weren\u2019t paying attention, as you were lost in thought.\n\nThe man himself is on the ground. He looks scared, but strangely not because of you. He keeps looking around.\n\n\u201cBy Yag, you\u2019re a pale one. Wait\u2026 you a vampire?\u201d the man asks.\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no point in me lying since you\u2019re going to be my food soon.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cYeah? Well we that follow Yag all know that eventually we can\u2019t beat the odds forever. In fact tonight the odds were REALLY against me. Didn\u2019t see it ending like this though, certainly wasn\u2019t in the temple betting pool, hah! However I\u2019d suggest you do it quickly before the Dornans get here. They see you and they\u2019ll use you for spell components, that is if the Joachimites don\u2019t get here first and just burn your undead ass.\u201d\n\nThe Yagite priest continues to look around, waiting for what you\u2019re going to do, but it was always obvious.\n\n\u201cWell guess I better follow your advice and make this quick then.\u201d You say and pick up the man and bite his neck. He makes little resistance other than gasping out some last prayer to Yag.\n\nYou haven\u2019t been eating long when you\u2019re interrupted. The Yag priest wasn\u2019t kidding when he said someone would be here soon.\n\n\u201cYagite scum, you\u2019ll pay for\u2026wha\u2026?\u201d a female voice says.\n\nYou look in the direction of the voice and snarl at being disturbed. You see a woman dressed in purple and blue robes and a couple of other members of her temple behind her.\n\n\u201cVampire!\u201d one of them shouts and begins to cast something and you leap into action.\n\n\u201cNo, wait!\u201d the female member says and backs away, but you and her subordinates aren\u2019t listening. You head towards the acolyte that was attempting to cast a spell.\n\nAfter you easily put your fist through his chest, you feel flames at your back, which the other acolyte has cast at you. The flames hurt, but it isn\u2019t nearly enough to save him, you\u2019re just too quick and you rip out his throat. You savior the quick taste of blood before turning towards your last foe.\n\n\u201cStop! Stop! It\u2019s me!\u201d the woman continues to shout as she puts a shield up and that\u2019s when your bloodlust subsides long enough to finally recognize who she is.\n\nIt\u2019s Heather.\n\nYou certainly didn\u2019t expect to run into her on your first night here. In the back of your head, you sort of had a concern that maybe if you ever did, it would stir up complicated feelings about her.\n\nHowever, at this moment the only thing you\u2019re feeling is the desire to slash her open and drink her dry\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Stop your attack", "result": "It takes everything within you, but you stop completely. Heather may not have been your girlfriend or even a friend in the traditional sense, but she was trying to help you once and her company however brief did comfort during that time.\n\nYou can\u2019t just forget all that.\n\n\u201cShit. Heather. Apologies. I\u2026well as you can see, I\u2019ve undergone a transformation since we last spoke.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened? Are you\u2026I mean you\u2019re really a\u2026\u201d Heather starts to say.\n\u201cVampire? Yes. I found a cure to my other condition after all.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026how? I mean not only how did you know, how did you find a vampire that would do it without killing you outright?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, fate sometimes finds a way of finding you and when it does, embrace it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I mean this is a severe change and irreversible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than that cold condition I had. I don\u2019t think you really know how unbearable that got.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I suppose I never truly did. So\u2026is this better then?\u201d\n\u201cFor the most part, I mean I can never see the sun again, but then I never was a day person to begin with. Oh and I have to drink blood from others to survive.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to kill them too?\u201d\n\u201cThe two normally go hand in hand, but considering the types I\u2019m often killing around here, I don\u2019t think anyone is going to miss them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m certainly going to miss my two acolytes.\u201d\n\u201cApologies.\u201d\n\u201cYou said that before. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re dead. \u201d\n\u201cWell, my new condition gets a little intense sometimes. I get in this mode and I just\u2026well you saw what happened. Though I stopped myself for you. That\u2019s the important thing right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026guess. Maybe I should go. I\u2019m going to somehow explain how I got two members killed hunting one pathetic Yagite. Nevermind, take care I guess.\u201d\n\nHeather backs off slowly from you, still keeping her shield up and her eyes on you the whole time.\n\nYou almost want to stop her, but you realize that maybe this is for the best that she reacted in this way. Not wishing to attract any excessive attention with all the bodies around, you take your leave and head back home without bothering to engage in whatever roguish endeavors you originally were intending.\n\nAs you make your way back home, you feel somewhat weird about the situation with Heather. You feel like it should be over and done with, but you can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\n\nWhy? Are you trying to hang on to some sort of \u201chumanity?\u201d Are you thinking about what could have been if things had been different? Do you think there still could be?\n\nYou quickly dismiss all of these thoughts mainly because it\u2019s stupidly suicidal to begin with. Isabella is your mate now and you really don\u2019t have many complaints about her. She\u2019s been more than understanding and helpful even if you don\u2019t feel exactly \u201cclose\u201d to her sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of which, when you arrive back home, Isabella soon comes to greet you. It would seem Isabella decided to wait up for you for a change. You weren\u2019t expecting her to.\n\n\u201cWell that was quick. I at least expected you to stay out until dawn. Did you have fun stealing items and whatever else?\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bother. I mostly ate and then got out of there.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cJust ran into a bit of unexpected resistance. Nothing I couldn\u2019t handle though. The religious factions in Holgard are practically having open battle in the streets, so it\u2019s making things a bit more chaotic than usual. Even the Joachimites have formed mobs to burn what they consider the unholy. Exciting though.\u201d\n\u201cHm, interesting. So does this mean you\u2019re not going back?\u201d\n\u201cEh, not sure yet. I think I need to reassess.\u201d\n\u201cWell whatever you like dear. Come now, let\u2019s lay together.\u201d\n\nThe next few days you stay away from Holgard and go back to hunting bandits and wanderers outside. During this time you think about how it\u2019s probably silly of you to avoid Holgard just because of Heather. Holgard is a big city and while its certainly possible to run into her again, you\u2019re confident that you don\u2019t have any real feelings for her.\n\nIt was just a brief bit of emotion brought on by your surprise to see her. Judging by her own reaction she\u2019s probably never going to want to be near you if she can help it.\n\nOf course this does bring up the question of how you\u2019ll react exactly if you DO see her again. You doubt if you\u2019ll kill her though.\n\nA week passes and you\u2019re back in Holgard. This time though, you decide to engage in some thievery rather than hunting. That was of course one of the things you were wondering if you\u2019d be interested in doing again.\n\nYou spend a few hours breaking into some jewelry stores with relative ease. Seems Isabella was right that you aren\u2019t getting the same thrill from it like you used to. It\u2019s just a little too easy and you suppose it\u2019s just not the same as hunting down something and drinking its blood.\n\nStill, no point in discarding what you\u2019ve got now. You\u2019ve never known Isabella to wear jewelry (or anything else for that matter) but maybe she\u2019ll appreciate the pretties all the same.\n\nAs you\u2019re sneaking back out of one of the stores, a familiar voice calls to you.\n\n\u201cGot anything pretty for me in there? Gotta say, didn\u2019t expect to find you ripping off some trinket store.\u201d Heather remarks standing nearby.\n\u201cWha\u2026Heather? What the hell are you doing here? Are you following me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell somewhat. I\u2019ve actually been looking for you for the past several days since I wanted to apologize for being so stand offish with you. \u201c\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s fine, completely understandable.\u201d You say getting ready to move on.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been casting detect undead regularly since that night just to apologize. I\u2019m guessing since you haven\u2019t back to the city for a while, our reunion was unexpected for you as well. Are you really okay? I mean sincerely?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Just in a bit of a hurry, I just robbed this store and the rogue in me likes to leave the scene of a crime as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right! Yeah, makes sense. Well can I come with you? I really would like to catch up with you. So much has happened and I besides how I acted last time, I sort of want to apologize for how we parted before that too.\u201d\n\nPart of you really wants to say \u201cNo.\u201d and just take off. A very small part of you feels like you should just kill her to avoid complications.\n\nHowever the largest part of you is the one that actually wants to talk with her like an idiot.\n\nGuess which one you follow?\n\n\u201cUh, okay fine. Just let\u2019s go some place secluded.\u201d You say.\n\nYou waste no time leaving the area and soon you and Heather are in some empty non-descript dark alley.\n\n\u201cNot exactly what I had in mind. I figured we\u2019d go to one of the neutral taverns and talk.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like crowds, besides any petty thugs that stumble upon us are going to be up shit\u2019s creek if they start trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI guess you got that one right, though I\u2019d be more concerned with the ECS patrols given their Fel connections, but again I suppose we could take them. Anyway, how have you been?\u201d\n\nHeather asks you in more detail about your vampirism, but you\u2019re somewhat hazy on the details of the hows and whys. (And you certainly don\u2019t mention Isabella) You get the impression Heather knows you\u2019re hiding something, but decides not to press the issue, probably not wishing to potentially anger you.\n\nInstead of interrogating you all night long, she decides to talk about herself and what she\u2019s been up to since you parted ways.\n\nHeather goes on to say that she\u2019s risen in rank at her temple and is practically second in command only to Elder Flynn himself. Though whenever she mentions him you don\u2019t get a tone of fondness.\n\n\u201cFar be it from me to pry, but I get the strong impression you don\u2019t like Elder Flynn anymore.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t dislike him. It\u2019s just\u2026ugh. He\u2019s been too passive in this war of the faith! He keeps wanting to play defensively when we should be going more on the attack! Dorna is the strongest goddess of all and while our temple may be one of the smallest in this city, we make up in quality! I\u2019d put any of ours against ten Felians! And the temple of Fel are arguably our only true competition here mainly because there are so many.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the factions?\u201d\n\u201cNot even worth speaking of. The Yagites are practically finished here. The brainless followers of Karn will eventually follow. The Joachimites would be more of a challenge, but again, they only have numbers on their side and not even to the extent that the Felians have. They would fall as well. I believe we could crush all other factions and make a separate peace with the temple of Fel. It\u2019s not ideal, but at least it would cut the competition down in the long run.\u201d\n\nYou always detected a bit of ambition in Heather even back when you were trading magic items for her help before. It would appear she\u2019s only gotten more so.\n\n\u201cWell, sounds like you\u2019ve got your hands full.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, I do and I don\u2019t get adequate help to perform the tasks I really need to do. Bah, anyway, I don\u2019t mean to unload my troubles on to you. I\u2019m not even sure why I am. I guess it\u2019s the act of a desperate woman.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019ll have to explain that one a little more.\u201d\n\u201c I suppose, I was hoping assuming you\u2019re willing of course that you might help me.\u201d\n\u201cHelp you do what exactly?\u201d\n\u201cTake down a rival faction.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, all by ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cI think we could do it! With your vampire powers and my magic abilities, I know for a fact that we could probably take out the Yagites or even Karnites!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026this whole thing really isn\u2019t my concern.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you like blood right? I mean you\u2019d practically be bathing in it. And given what I saw of you with my acolytes, you definitely like killing. Unless you\u2019re seriously telling me you like easily stealing from shops more.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t deny that. I do like killing and I do like blood. It\u2019s just...\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of Dorna! You can\u2019t help me in the same way I tried to help you in the past? Have you forgotten so quickly of all the risks I took?\u201d Heather says with a raised voice.\n\nShe then realizes that she may have overstepped a boundary when your attitude becomes less cordial.\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t forgotten. I also haven\u2019t forgotten of how you just left me to save your own ass when things were getting too risky for you. I even suggested that we run away together, but no. Your faith was more important and that\u2019s what you chose. Now, you\u2019re seriously getting pissed at me for not wanting to get involved in your personal war that I don\u2019t really give a shit about? I think YOU forget that you\u2019re addressing a vampire. One who is close enough to drain you dry before you could even utter a single incantation to defend yourself right now. I haven\u2019t even used my powers of suggestion on you to make you into my puppet and have you do what I want before ultimately disposing of you. And if I chose to do so, there would be no way for you to stop me. So don\u2019t forget THAT.\u201d\n\nYour firm reminder of who you are to Heather causes her to back off a bit. She even looks a bit embarrassed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right of course\u2026I just\u2026I know\u2026\u201d\n\nHeather immediately brandishes a small dagger.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d you ask fully prepared to defend yourself.\n\u201cI want to prove that my feelings for you, haven\u2019t gone away. I\u2019ve always thought fondly of our intimacy together that day. I\u2019ve always felt saddened as well. Always wondering what might have been. I never dreamed that we could have another chance. But now with you back, maybe I thought we could try again. It won\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019m willing to take that step. I offer myself to you once again. You may do whatever you will to me. Ravish me here in this alley like a common whore, drink my blood until you\u2019ve had your fill, it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that I trust you. Perhaps then, when you\u2019ve had your way with me, you may find that part of you still has feelings for me as well. If you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have spared me at all.\u201d Heather says and cuts her arm.\n\nShe then thrusts the bleeding limb at you. Tempting you like this, is very risky on her part since it\u2019s likely to just cause you to go into a feeding frenzy and kill her outright.\n\nHowever, perhaps she was right about you still having some feelings for her because you keep yourself in check and only take a little of her blood. Heather winces a bit, but when your mouth soon moves to her own she is enjoying it.\n\nYou waste no time in turning her around and lifting up her robe and having your way roughly with her against the nearby wall.\n\nAs you thrust inside her, you whisper in her ear.\n\n\u201cDo you really desire my help?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Do with me, as you like. Just help me crush my enemies in Dorna\u2019s name.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you crush your enemies, but the only name you\u2019ll be praising tonight is going to be mine.\u201d\n\nYou can sense her excitement, her fear, her tension, everything. Something about all this is really doing it for you as well. You\u2019re totally dominating her and that\u2019s even more exhilarating than just killing someone and drinking their blood. This isn\u2019t even like having sex with Isabella either. This is something new you\u2019re experiencing and you\u2019re going to enjoy the hell out of it.\n\nYou keep Heather quite during your intimacy by putting your hand over her mouth. Her stifled squeaks and your own reserved grunts are the only sound until your time is done with her.\n\nHeather takes a moment to catch her breath. She\u2019s probably never quite been treated that way before.\n\n\u201cThat was\u2026uh\u2026(whew) I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA glimpse of things to come. Now, I\u2019ll be back tomorrow night and we can continue with your plans. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find me again.\u201d You respond.\n\nYou leave Heather in the alley to collect herself and head home feeling a bit more positive about your trip to Holgard this time.\n\nWhen you get home Isabella is in her garden, you decide not to disturb her and get some early rest. You figure you\u2019re going to have to save your strength for what you\u2019ve gotten yourself into.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 27\n\nThis religious war has been the most fun you\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nWhile you\u2019ve mostly been taking advantage of the chaos that the city has been plaguing the city again, you have also been working along side Heather in her efforts to take down the other religious factions.\n\nHeather isn\u2019t supposed to be engaging the other factions as much as she\u2019s doing, since Elder Flynn was still against being so aggressive. However, she\u2019s been openly arguing with him and convincing others members to follow her lead on this strategy. Since she\u2019s a respected voice within her group, Elder Flynn has relented a bit.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly been directed towards the Yagites since she wants to make a concentrated effort on one group, but occasionally others are fought as well.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s been keeping all dealings with you as close to the vest as possible. Whenever you work with her, it\u2019s always just her and there are no other Dornans helping. You aren\u2019t sure why, but then you\u2019ve never bothered to ask.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re just in this for the killing and fucking Heather mostly.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re in the process of attacking the main temple of Yag. Their numbers have dwindled to a point where an attack wouldn\u2019t be suicidal. Pathetically easy in fact as you face little resistance and soon leave Heather behind to \u201csweep up\u201d the acolytes that pose no real challenge.\n\nYou burst into the inner sanctum of Yag\u2019s temple. Several followers busily attempt to call forth incantations in order to stop you, but the most damage one does is summon forth a bunch of butterflies to flutter in your face.\n\nThe winds of their \u201cluck magic\u201d are blowing the wrong way constantly. Yag either isn\u2019t listening, doesn\u2019t give a shit or is finding it all pretty amusing. Either way, the advantage is yours.\n\nYou rip into three members and then two more before you\u2019re half way across the room. The Yagite high priest is busily rolling dice on his altar (which resembles more of a craps table) Every now and then he looks up at you, but continues to roll his dice, cursing the entire time.\n\nEventually you reach him and just as you grab him he manages to roll one last time. You both see the results and its snake eyes.\n\n\u201cLooks like you lose.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been losing for quite some time now. Tried to bet big, but it\u2019s all come to this. Such is the way of Yag.\u201d The high priest says\n\u201cYou Yagites are very odd, you certainly don\u2019t want to die, but the few that I have ever spoken with always have a resigned fate when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no point in fighting fate son. When your numbers don\u2019t come up, there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it. We had a good run here in Holgard, but I guess the odds were more against us than we thought. I got one question for you though. What the hell do you have against us? We don\u2019t hunt vampires. We don\u2019t hunt anything. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be after the Joachimites more than us\u2026or are we just an easier target? You the Dornans pet vampire or what? You know those assholes will eventually dispose of you too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s fucking pet!\u201d you snap and start to crush the high priest\u2019s windpipe.\n\nHeather walks in and you turn to look at her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill him yet, I need to interrogate him first!\u201d Heather shouts.\n\nYou drop the high priest to the floor. He coughs a bit and then begins to struggle to laugh.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so fucking funny?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, sure. You\u2019re nobody\u2019s pet.\u201d The high priest laughs.\n\nThis small act of disrespect is enough for you to kick him in the face, putting your foot partially through it killing him instantly.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck!? I told you I wanted him alive to interrogate! The Yagites might be broken by this, but they could have hideouts still in the city somewhere! He probably could have revealed other information as well!\u201d Heather scolds.\n\u201cHeather, I think you\u2019re forgetting who you\u2019re talking to again.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, I know who I\u2019m talking to, and YOU\u2019RE supposed to be following my lead on these matters!\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly grab Heather, lift her robe up and bend her over the altar. Doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019ve established your dominance again. It\u2019s a common routine for the pair of you at this point. You both enjoy it.\n\nAfter you\u2019re done, you\u2019re ready to move on, but of course Heather isn\u2019t done with you yet.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cI helped you wipe out this temple and I fucked you. My job is done for the night.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to leave so damn quickly. I want to make plans for our next major endeavor.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but make it quick and we probably shouldn\u2019t stick around in a temple full of dead priests.\u201d\n\nYou and Heather take your leave of the temple and find a secluded spot to talk about your next moves. Or at least Heather is, you\u2019re just listening.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think our next move should focus on the Joachimites.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d say the Karnite since they\u2019re few in number.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI would, but I believe the Felians are in the process of wiping them out. No need to get in their way and no need to waste time on something someone else is doing anyway. Joachimites are a big problem though and I figure you being a vampire and all, you\u2019d enjoy taking them out all the more.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually indifferent. All these mortals are just blood bags to me. Whether they have some irrational hate for me or not is irrelevant since I\u2019m killing them anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose that\u2019s one way to look at it. Um, it might take awhile for me to call on your help though on this. I need to talk this over with my brothers and sisters and get them on board with this too. Elder Flynn was eventually fine with wiping out the Yagites, might be harder to convince him about the Joachim fanatics though.\u201d\n\u201cSure, whatever. I\u2019ll just be stalking the streets like I normally do. Maybe I\u2019ll bump into a Joachimite from time to time to give us less to worry about in future battles with them.\u201d\n\u201cYeah about that, I was sort of wondering if you could take a break from the city for awhile. Like maybe a few months or so.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cOur relationship is getting a bit harder to hide from the rest of my brethren.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what difference does it make? I thought you lot weren\u2019t supernatural hating fanatics.\u201d\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t, but you don\u2019t understand. If they knew I had a vampire helping me, it would cause unnecessary complications.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, I can\u2019t imagine that your people don\u2019t know at all about me already.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually. If they did, I probably would have been confronted already, especially by Elder Flynn. He\u2019d be asking WHY I had not been sharing you with the rest as a valuable resource.\u201d\n\u201cResource?\u201d\n\u201cYes resource. To most of them, you wouldn\u2019t be looked upon as an individual, but rather a weapon to be used to the fullest degree.\u201d\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re sort of doing?\u201d\n\u201cI am not! Our relationship is more than that! Or at least I thought it was, do you feel differently?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting into this again.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell maybe we should, because lately I feel like you don\u2019t appreciate ALL the risks I take to keep us together! This is like when I was visiting you during your cold curse all over again!\u201d\n\nAnd this was something you were trying to avoid. Heather has an uncanny knack of turning everything around to make it all about herself and be overly dramatic about it as well.\n\nWhile Heather goes into a tirade about how much she\u2019s sacrificing for your relationship, you don\u2019t even bother sticking around, you just leave. You don\u2019t have to listen to this, because you\u2019ve heard it all before, and at this point you\u2019re sort of wondering WHY you\u2019re still putting up with it.\n\nYou guess you have enough fondness for Heather that you don\u2019t want to kill her, but you\u2019re starting to get the real impression that she\u2019s not really relationship material either. Sure she\u2019s masochistic enough to put up with your own power trip bullshit, but you could probably just charm some random mortal if you really wanted to do that with significantly less hassle.\n\nAnd it\u2019s apparent she feeds off of it in some weird way. Maybe she\u2019s a vampire too in her own fashion.\n\nIn any case, you head back home. You start to think maybe you haven\u2019t been appreciating Isabella as much as you should be. Sure, she\u2019s a bit condescending at times when she disapproves of something you\u2019ve done, but she\u2019s centuries old. Of course she\u2019s going to be like that.\n\nIf anything she\u2019s very tolerant of you. In fact she\u2019s helped you more than Heather ever has and unlike Heather she can keep up the pace in the bedroom.\n\nWhy the hell have you even been cheating on her again?\n\nBecause you\u2019re an idiot that still doesn\u2019t know what the hell you want. Makes sense you suppose. Your life has been fairly off track ever since you left Teckleville and you\u2019ve been fumbling around ever since.\n\nThat changes after tonight. You\u2019re going to go home and reaffirm your dedication to Isabella. Especially since you also realize that despite having been with her for a couple years, you still don\u2019t know much about her own past.\n\nWell at least you thought you were. Isabella as it turned out had other plans.\n\nAs soon as you walk into the crypt you find Isabella waiting for you to tell you that you\u2019re leaving.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kicking me out?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cConsidering that it\u2019s almost dawn, you\u2019ll be able to stay here until tomorrow night, but as soon as the sun goes down, I want you out of here.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cBut can\u2019t we talk about this?!\u201d\n\u201cNo. You\u2019ve had MORE than enough time to talk about what\u2019s going on with you, yet you\u2019ve chosen to try to hide your actions. It\u2019s obvious that you have some human whore on the side. Mind you, I didn\u2019t even care at first\u2026even assumed you\u2019d probably stray from time to time. Most likely fucking your prey before you killed them. However I\u2019ve detected the same familiar scent on you for months now. Obviously it\u2019s same the woman.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you knew?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I knew. I\u2019m not an idiot. Or did you not notice that I stopped sharing the bed with you months ago?\u201d\n\u201cI just figured you were really into your garden.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well if you had any concern, you would have known I was sleeping in there. In any case, I figured I\u2019d still give you some time to either confess or even better, eventually get bored enough to kill her, but given I can still smell the stench of her on you even tonight, I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\u201cIsabella, you\u2019re so damn aloof towards me that I don\u2019t even know if you care whether I\u2019m here or not most of the time. I mean if we didn\u2019t fuck, we might as well just be cryptmates. You never talk to me about yourself, and I\u2019m not mind reader, I mean if I had known that me seeing Heather was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHeather? Is that its name then? Tell me, what exactly is so special about this woman that she\u2019s gotten so much of your attention?\u201d\n\nYou explain as short as possible of your odd long-term relationship with Heather. To Isabella\u2019s credit, she listens without anger and doesn\u2019t interrupt.\n\n\u201cI see. Well, I suppose then it does make a little more sense. Here I was thinking it was some random pretty face, however I\u2019m somewhat relieved to hear that there was at least some deeper reasoning behind it all. Perhaps this is the woman for you after all.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cWhat? No! In fact I was just coming over here to reaffirm my love for you! Heather isn\u2019t the one for me!\u201d you remark.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she? Seems like you\u2019ve been spending more time helping her in her tasks than what would be normal. You obviously have fondness for this girl. And you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t really know me that well at all. Perhaps some of that is my fault. Decades of being alone tend to make one reclusive even to those that you have feelings for, but as I said, I was always here and you could have made the effort.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m making it now! I love you!\u201d\n\u201cNo. No you don\u2019t. You had a fight with your girlfriend because she\u2019s demanding something that you don\u2019t want to do so you\u2019re going for the easy way out, by falling back on me. Well, that\u2019s not how relationships work. You sometimes have to do shit you don\u2019t want to do rather than running off at the first sign of trouble.\u201d\n\nIsabella approaches you with a smile and touches your face.\n\n\u201cNow maybe it IS a case that you don\u2019t love this Heather and have decided that she isn\u2019t for you, but in any case you don\u2019t love me and I don\u2019t really love you either. I was just lonely and liked you well enough that I thought you might fulfill that gap and you did, for a while at least. You\u2019re a free vampire and I\u2019ve told you all the basics of what this life is like. Anything else, you\u2019ll have to figure out yourself. Take care okay?\u201d\n\nIsabella, without another word turns to leave you. You decide to make a last ditch effort and put your hand on her shoulder. She spins around so quick that you\u2019re on the floor from a punch to the face before you realize it.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck!? I was just going to kiss you!\u201d you exclaim holding your face in pain.\n\u201cAnd I told you it was over and I meant it. This isn\u2019t going to be one of those rewritten happy endings in a children\u2019s fairy tale where the man kisses the girl and everything is all better again.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cObviously not\u2026shit\u2026\u201d\n\nAs Isabella leaves you on the floor to ponder your misguided judgment of how she really feels about you, you also ponder what you\u2019re going to do when you get up tomorrow night. It\u2019s too much to think about right now so you just go to bed.\n\nThe next night, you gather your meager belongings and leave the crypt as quickly as you can. No sign of Isabella, you assume she\u2019s in her garden, but you don\u2019t want to be around for her to see you again anyway.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure where to go. Your first instinct is to just go to Holgard. Heather told you not to, but why the hell do you really need to listen to her for? Actually you still haven\u2019t sorted out all your feelings about that relationship yet either.\n\nIsabella might have had it right in that you were just running away from Heather because you didn\u2019t want to do what she said. Maybe you could talk with her though. Sure, she\u2019s a bit dramatic at times, but she\u2019s usually willing to listen. She has taken risks for you, so that is worth considering.\n\nOf course part of you just wants to say \u201cfuck it\u201d and leave this area entirely. Seems like nothing good has come of it ever since you left Teckleville.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to Holgard", "result": "You might as well go back to Holgard and stay there until you figure out your next major move. No real reason to leave considering the plentiful food source. You can probably make a home in one of the tombs in their graveyard in the meantime.\n\nNot to mention you\u2019re loathed to leave just because Heather doesn\u2019t want you around for a while. You can\u2019t believe the nerve of her. She\u2019s pretty annoying at times, if she were anyone else, you wouldn\u2019t be putting up with it, but since you are, Isabella might have been correct in thinking you must have stronger attachment to her than you even let on.\n\nIn any case, you make your way back to Holgard and kill a few whores before ultimately fixing up a suitable tomb for yourself.\n\nOver the course of a few weeks you take the opportunity to hunt down a few Joachimites that are stupid enough to wander in smaller groups just so you don\u2019t have to deal with as many of the fanatics in the future.\n\nYou aren\u2019t terribly surprised when you eventually get a visit from Heather.\n\n\u201cHello? You awake? I know you\u2019re in here.\u201d You hear Heather say as she steps inside the tomb.\n\u201cYeah, now I\u2019m awake! Close the fucking door, you\u2019re letting the daylight in!\u201d you shout from inside your stone coffin.\n\nWhen you hear the door close, you slide the slab open and sit up.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want? I\u2019m trying to get some rest, you couldn\u2019t have come around night instead of the middle of the fucking day?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t have been home, what with you massacring Joachimites and all.\u201d Heather says.\n\u201cProbably not. Let me guess, you\u2019re here to bitch at me for being here at all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I sort of know that would be pointless since you obviously aren\u2019t going to listen. In fact I sort of figured after our last talk, you\u2019d be here more often anyway. So are you living in the city now? I thought you lived somewhere outside of it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, things have changed since our last talk, so I\u2019m living here now. You mad about that too?\u201d\n\nHeather shakes her head and sighs.\n\n\u201cStop being an asshole for a moment, I\u2019m trying to tell you that I don\u2019t care. I realize that I shouldn\u2019t have tried to tell you what to do. I apologize. I\u2019m just really stressed about everything on my mind lately.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I guess you did have your reasons. Honestly though, I don\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t just killed the old bastard yet. I mean that IS what your end game ultimately is right? Take over the temple along with having it be one of the two remaining religions in this city?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026but I really don\u2019t like it. Elder Flynn has been like a father to me. I mean in the eyes of Dorna, he basically IS my father in some ways. I really didn\u2019t want it to come to this, but his path to not the right one for the future of our temple. Dorna is a goddess that deserves more attention and respect. We won\u2019t get that if we remain as we are.\u201d\n\u201cWell not everyone has the ability to be a wizard, let alone the discipline or talent.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but that doesn\u2019t mean the non-magical people can\u2019t pay their respects. Dorna is also a goddess of knowledge. It\u2019s very sad that so many are content on remaining ignorant.\u201d\n\u201cThe fools have got to have their fun.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may. Deposing Elder Flynn is not going to be easy. I really need to make sure I have everyone on my side in the temple first and I do mean everyone. Best way to do that is convince them that my way is working and honestly your recent activity has been helping rather than hurting.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course it is, I\u2019m killing the opposition.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I had feared that it might cause unwanted attention before I had time to organize and talk to my brethren first. However, most of them haven\u2019t needed much convincing. I think wiping out the Yagites has caused a domino effect and many are willing to follow my plans.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Elder Flynn?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the other thing. He\u2019s been in meditation for a week now. Granted he\u2019s been known to disappear like that anyway, but the fact that he\u2019s withdrawn for so long during this time is strange. Though it\u2019s another reason why your actions haven\u2019t bothered me. Elder Flynn hasn\u2019t been focusing on outside activities.\u201d\n\u201cSo why not kill him now? Sounds like you\u2019ve got this already wrapped up.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, not so simple. Plus, he\u2019s in meditation, which means he\u2019s currently got magic shields and such around him. He\u2019d also be at his most powerful since he\u2019s been storing up energy.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I think you\u2019re hesitating and overthinking this shit. I say the longer you wait, the worse the harder it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2026that\u2019s why I want you to help when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one with all the magic friends and defenses!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already had experience killing one powerful wizard right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that was sheer luck when I really think about it. And I had help.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll have even more help when the time comes. I\u2019ll still be there, along with the rest of the temple!\u201d\n\nHeather approaches closer and leans into your chest while staring into your eyes.\n\n\u201cPlease I just really need your direct support on this. I know we\u2019ve been having our problems lately, and I know you\u2019ve been going above and beyond. But I really feel like we have something special. If I didn\u2019t believe we did, I would have never given myself so willingly to you. I feel like your strength and ruthlessness of what needs to be done will make me less likely to waver in this task.\u201d\n\nYou look at Heather and see the hopeful desperation in her eyes. You also see her dedication to you. You suppose it is true. Despite all your problems, the pair of you do have a lovers bond and you could do worse than Heather. (And you don\u2019t just think that because Isabella isn\u2019t in your life anymore)\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you directly on this, but if we\u2019re going to do this, it needs to be done as soon as possible. I\u2019m ready to go now and do it for example.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh no, not right now. I still should organize more.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cLook Heather, the old bastard needs to die if you really want to take over. That\u2019s all there is to it. You have to put your sentimentality aside. Now I\u2019ve already agreed to help, but you NEED to play your part.\u201d\n\u201cI will! I will! I just really need to set things in motion and solidify alliances. Give me at least a couple days, okay? Whether everything is good or not, we\u2019ll go through it.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. So, where are attacking tonight? I assume you\u2019ve got a group of Joachimite fanatics in mind.\u201d\n\u201cHm, maybe you should save your strength and just relax with a good meal. In fact maybe you should have little magic with your meal, then afterwards you can satisfy your other appetites. \u201c\n\nHeather cuts herself for you and you indulge in her blood without another word. After you\u2019ve had enough, you proceed to take her up on her other offer.\n\nThe next few nights are uneventful for you and you go for easier prey since you keep in mind of what you\u2019re going to be up against soon. You just hope Heather actually goes through with it and doesn\u2019t come back to you in saying something like \u201cUm\u2026I think we need to wait some more\u2026\u201d\n\nShe shows up after three days have passed.\n\n\u201cThere you are, glad to see it only took you one extra day.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThere were some complications.\u201d Heather remarks nervously.\n\u201cHm\u2026you seem very nervous. I do hope you aren\u2019t going to tell me you need more time.\u201d\n\u201cNo, tonight is the night. I\u2019ve managed to convince most of my brethren to side with me either directly or at least look the other way. Elder Flynn himself has finally left his meditation. He\u2019s not going to go down without a fight, but I believe we\u2019ll be able to take him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, but you still seem really nervous.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous! This is a winner take all gamble and on top of never facing someone so powerful, I\u2019m also facing a man I used to respect. (Sigh) Well like you said, best to just get it over with, stand still.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cast protective magic on you. You might be supernatural, but if you go in without any protection, Elder Flynn is going to just incinerate you with a beam of light.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well okay, anything that will help then.\u201d\n\nHeather mumbles some prayers to Dorna and casts something over you and you\u2019re bathed in some sort of blue light temporarily. It lasts a few seconds and then disappears. After casting the spell, Heather seems a bit calmer.\n\n\u201cOkay, that should do it. How do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different, is it working?\u201d\n\u201cYes, if you felt something then something would be wrong. Okay, let\u2019s go do this dark task. We\u2019re going back to the temple. Those that are in on the plan will be there, along with Elder Flynn.\u201d\n\u201cNothing like killing a man in his own home, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou and Heather make haste to the temple of Dorna and when you arrive a group of young acolytes stand around outside. One of them approaches Heather.\n\n\u201cSister, you\u2019re here. All of us here are ready to follow your lead. Those that do not wish to take part have left and will not stand in your way.\u201d The young priest says.\n\u201cUnderstandable. This is grim business. There will be no retribution upon them afterwards.\u201d Heather remarks.\n\u201cUnderstood\u2026is this the vampire?\u201d the priest says looking at you a bit anxiously. Before you can say anything Heather speaks quickly.\n\u201cYes, and he\u2019s already been informed and will help us.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, Elder Flynn is in the summoning chamber. I believe he\u2019s engrossed in an experiment of some sort. He doesn\u2019t know or suspect anything.\u201d\n\u201cGood, then I guess the best thing to do would be to just rush in there and take him by surprise.\u201d\n\nYou, Heather and all her little friends enter the temple. Heather takes lead and after walking down a few corridors you all come to a solid ornate double door.\n\n\u201cOkay, this is it.\u201d Heather remarks and exhales.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d You say and open up the doors.\n\nAt this point you take the lead. Your hope is that you\u2019ll be so quick that this will be over before anyone realizes it.\n\nYou see an old man at a bunch of tables with various alchemy equipment on them at the far end of the room. You\u2019re already half way across it before he turns around.\n\nThen just as you get almost within range of him, you suddenly freeze in place with a wave of his hand.\n\nAt this moment you\u2019d say \u201cShit!\u201d but you can\u2019t speak either.\n\nYou think that at least Heather and the rest will come in to help you, but after a few seconds of no sounds of shouting or orders, you realize this situation is even worse. Elder Flynn is noticing that you\u2019re realizing that too.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong vampire? Have you finally realized that you\u2019ve been played like a like a cheap lute? I knew Sister Heather\u2019s ambitions long ago. While she did her best to try to keep things secret from me, she should have known that Dorna favors the most knowledgable and wise and in this case, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nElder Flynn waves his hand a bit more and after a few moments you see out of the corner of your eye, Heather levitating slightly off the floor and then being slowly placed back on it. She\u2019s frozen as well.\n\n\u201cThe rest of you hanging about the door over there can leave. You\u2019ve played your part, get back to your studies or whatever tasks you need to do. And close the door too.\u201d Flynn remarks and you soon hear the sound of the doors close behind you.\n\nNow it\u2019s just the three of you alone. Elder Flynn walks over to Heather.\n\n\u201cI looked upon you as a daughter, do you know that? Even though I knew you sought to one day replace me, I had hoped that you would at least be smart about it. Such a waste. You are going to severely pay for your treachery girl. I can\u2019t describe just how much, but you\u2019ll soon experience it for yourself.\u201d\n\nElder Flynn then walks over to you.\n\n\u201cYou on the other hand I suppose are an unwitting pawn in all this. Barely more intelligent than a zombie servant. Fitting, considering you\u2019re little better than one. Vampires are always such slaves to their base needs and yours have lead you to this fate. Take solace in the fact that you won\u2019t have to see your little girlfriend suffer, but I will be using your ashes in an interesting spell I have in store for her.\u201d\n\nYou want to attack, yell, bite, scream, and rip apart Flynn, but all your anger is impotent in your current frozen state.\n\nThen it\u2019s gone when Flynn casts a strong beam of light which incinerates you quickly, though not quick enough for you not to feel the pain before you die.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave", "result": "Maybe Isabella throwing you out is a good thing.

You sub-consciously wanted to get caught\u2026though that was a pretty stupid way to go about it. Isabella could have easily been so pissed at you that she killed you.\n\nHowever as it turned out luck favored the foolish, which is ironic considering you just recently had a hand in slaughtering a temple of Yag.\n\nIn any case, you realize that with nothing tying you to this area anymore, you might as well just leave.

It had left me utterly alone and had driven away the only thing that was ever good in my life. You. The longer I was in my cold exile, the more I dwelled on what could have been with you. I came close to suicide, believing that moment with you would be the last good thing that would ever happen to me. Knowing what I know now, I wish I had gone through with it.\u201d\n\nYou slowly stand up and continue to look ashamed by your actions.\n\n\u201cBut my will to live I suppose was a bit too strong. Indeed some of that was due to you. I thought maybe, just MAYBE if I could fix myself, that I could rekindle what we might have had. Even if you had moved on, it still would have been worth it, I thought. So I followed a rumor, and then a trail, and then eventually found the undead creature that was bored enough to help me. Risky, but I figured if he was going to kill me, what would I really lose? Fortunately he turned out to be rather sympathetic in his own way.\u201d you say.\n\u201cBut WHY did you do this?! I mean you had to have known the results!\u201d Heather asks.\n\u201cAs I said\u2026for you\u2026I foolishly believed that somehow I could be different. That it could survive on animal blood or the blood of creatures, it worked\u2026for awhile.\u201d\n\nYou look at Heather mournfully; Heather still looks a bit cautious, but is looking a bit more sympathetic towards you (Well more sympathetic towards you than she is with her followers laying on the street dead)\n\n\u201cI tried\u2026I tried so hard\u2026I even sacrificed Spikey\u2026I soon realized that I would never be fit to be in your presence.\u201d you say and choke up a little before continuing.\n\n\u201cBut the call of the thirst was just too strong and I found myself heading back towards civilization\u2026I figured at least maybe here in this cesspit of crime, that maybe killing murderers and the like wouldn\u2019t make me as bad\u2026but with each life I take, I find that I\u2019m just getting more detached...I\u2019ve started thinking about even targeting those that aren\u2019t deserving of it\u2026 I almost sought you out for help, but I was too ashamed\u2026 I\u2019m so lost\u2026 Heather\u2026.please help me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can.

I see you and know there\u2019s hope again. Please help me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nYou continue to stare at Heather who now has dropped her magic barrier and begun to move a little closer to you. Your voice and your eyes have managed to get her to lower her guard. It\u2019s not complete, but at this point you\u2019re close enough that it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou lunge and before Heather can do anything else, you\u2019ve easily restrained her and about to bite. She looks at you with wide-eyed terror.\n\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d she utters.\n\nAnd for a brief moment, you actually consider it.\n\n\u201cShhhh, it\u2019ll only hurt a little and then oblivion.\u201d You whisper and then bite down on her jugular like a ravenous animal.\n\nHer blood tastes different than most humans, but in a good way. Might be due to her magical nature. In any case you drink deeply and hold her tight as if you were making love to her, and in a way you are.\n\nHeather struggles at first, but she soon begins to weaken and then ultimately give in until her life force is gone.\n\nAfter you\u2019re finished, you look at her dead face and close her eyes.\n\n\u201cYou finally helped me Heather. May your goddess Dorna embrace you.\u201d\n\nWith bodies all around, it\u2019s sort of amazing that nobody else has stumbled upon you. (Of course maybe someone did and wisely turned around before you noticed.) Not wishing to spend anymore time here, you take your leave and head back home without bothering to engage in whatever roguish endeavors you originally were intending.\n\nAs you make your way back home, you feel somewhat weird about your actions. You feel like you should feel remorse, and sometimes you think you\u2019re beginning to have a twinge of it, but then it\u2019s gone.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have to kill Heather. You weren\u2019t that hungry. You could have stopped yourself. So why did you do it? What was the real reason?\n\nSelf-preservation.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t killed her, you would have surely done something stupid like develop an attachment to her again and that would have led to your death and most likely hers anyway. Either Isabella would have killed you or Heather\u2019s fanatical friends would have.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to complicate your life like that. Better that she serve as food than as a distraction.\n\nLooks like you\u2019re fine with sticking to the basics after all.\n\nWhen you arrive back home, Isabella soon comes to greet you. It would seem Isabella decided to wait up for you for a change, you weren\u2019t expecting her to, but the fact that she did, just confirms that you made the right decision.\n\n\u201cWell that was quick. I at least expected you to stay out until dawn. Did you have fun stealing items and whatever else?\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bother. I mostly ate.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOh? Well hope you got a good one then.\u201d\n\u201cI did. I ate my ex-girlfriend.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s eyebrows rise in intrigue.\n\n\u201cReally? Isabella asks, but not in a jealous way, just curious.\n\u201cWell, I suppose she wasn\u2019t really a girlfriend\u2026we just knew each other and we were intimate once.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI see. And were you so excited that you were intimate again? Perhaps she found your dark charms alluring and in the heat of passion, you couldn\u2019t help yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI manipulated her into dropping her guard after I slaughtered her friends, then I drank her dry\u2026and I didn\u2019t feel anything about it. This woman who once tried to help me, I felt nothing after killing her other than it was necessary. And the only excitement I felt was when I was feeding and holding her warm body close as it slowly turned as cold as mine.\"\n\nIsabella takes your words in and slowly begins to move towards you while caressing her own body.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026is soooo sexy\u2026.I had no idea that you were capable of such a thing. Killing random peasants and bandits is one thing, but this\u2026well that\u2019s something different. I want you inside me, right now.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\nYou sort of wonder if Isabella has always been this horny or maybe this is just her making up for lost time due to a long period of isolation. Either way you\u2019re not complaining.\n\nThe next night you prepare to go out to Holgard again. This time you\u2019re fully prepared to just hunt though.\n\nThe city is about to have yet another major ongoing problem, or maybe a solution depending on one\u2019s outlook on things.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 3C1: The Beast Unleashed\n\n\n\nYear 30\n\n\u201cWell of course there are vampire hunters running around in Holgard now. I told you that you probably needed to start showing a bit of restraint now that the religious factions aren\u2019t killing each other anymore.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cYou said that Holgard was a perfect spot for me to hunt due to all the crime and violence!\u201d you reply.\n\u201cYeah, but still within reason. I mean from some of the tales you\u2019ve told me in the past, it sounds like you just leave a killing field in your wake half the time. As I said, you probably were only getting away with it due to the religious faction war, but now that that\u2019s over with, they\u2019re on to you. Look, you had your fun, but it\u2019s probably time to rein it in a bit anyway. You had like what five years? Honestly, I probably gave you your freedom a bit too quickly.\u201d\n\u201cSo what, are you cracking the whip on me now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I will say that I\u2019m fond of you enough that I would LIKE you to still be around for a long time to come. You might think a few vampire hunters are no problem, but I imagine they aren\u2019t the only ones hunting you. I mean you were taking advantage of the religious faction war, I have to believe that some of them groups aren\u2019t vampire friendly either. Wasn\u2019t your ex a Dornan? Pretty sure those wizard priests might have discovered a vampire operating in the city by now and I\u2019m not even counting the fanatical Joachimites you told me about.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that maybe you should give Holgard a break for awhile if you can\u2019t restrain yourself. Go find another hunting ground that isn\u2019t going to attract attention. I\u2019m sure there are little isolated towns and villages further east of here. I\u2019m sure there are probably bandits preying upon them as well, so you\u2019ve got a wide selections to choose from.\u201d\n\nYou somewhat frown at that suggestion.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to skulk about a village luring peasants to their doom, I might as well be grocery shopping for you in Dert.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I dunno, go wipe out an entire hamlet then, I don\u2019t care. Just don\u2019t be a dumb ass and leave any witnesses. Because I\u2019m going to tell you this as well, it\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re going to insist on playing with your immortality, but it\u2019s quite another if you start fucking with mine. If your actions end up causing a group of adventurers to come barging down here in the middle of the day, waking up my beauty sleep, you are going to wish you\u2019d been staked and beheaded after I get done with you. Understand?\u201d Isabella says with a calm threatening tone that is enough to unnerve even you.\n\u201cYes\u2026dear.\u201d You meekly utter.\n\nIsabella gives you a stern look and then leaves you to your own devices.\n\nIsabella may not have any direct power over you, but she\u2019s still powerful enough to crush you if she wanted to. You don\u2019t actually think she\u2019d kill you, but you don\u2019t doubt that she wouldn\u2019t make your unlife miserable for a very long time.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t so grateful for everything she\u2019s done for you, you might be inclined to leave and not return. However in the grand scheme of things you\u2019re fairly happy with her so there isn\u2019t much incentive to do so.\n\nShe\u2019s usually right anyway. Might be time to settle down a bit. Mass slaughter is starting to lose its appeal anyway. Well not ALL its appeal, but maybe you should change it up, especially if you want to go back to Holgard one day.\n\nFor the first few weeks, you don\u2019t go to Holgard and instead wander further to the east a bit. Honestly, you\u2019ve never traveled in that direction for any extended length of time save for when you released Spikey back into the wild. That was slightly harder than you thought it would be, but at least it was better than Isabella killing him.\n\nYou sort of wonder if you\u2019ll run into him, but you don\u2019t, who knows where he is now. (You hope he\u2019s happily eating people wherever he is though)\n\nYou do know is if you go far enough you\u2019ll reach the borders of the Delantium Kingdom. Of course that\u2019s still quite the ways even with your speed and you aren\u2019t that adventurous.\n\nWhat you do find are a few small isolated villages. Bigger than Dert and nearly the size of the your old home of Teckleville. Same sort of people too, funny how no matter where you go, places like this are the same everywhere.\n\nYou skulk around these minor villages, luring an unsuspecting peasant or two for food, but it\u2019s dull since it\u2019s basically like when you do it back in Dert.\n\nYou encounter nomads, brigands, and raider types of various races. Again, those are more fun since you can let loose a bit more, but a lot of these tend to be on the non-human side and at this point you\u2019ve acquired more of a taste for human blood as opposed to greenskin or some of the other savage races you\u2019ve come across.\n\nUpon your return on these daily travels, Isabella almost never asks you what you were up to. She doesn\u2019t seem to care as long as you aren\u2019t bringing trouble to her crypt. Sometimes you mention what you\u2019ve been up to and she listens, and sometimes asking basic questions back, nothing more though.\n\nA few months pass, and you\u2019re about ready to go back to Holgard just to see if things have died down there a bit, but you decide to stick it out a little while longer and continue doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nYou head to Maldito, which is one of the more remote villages, even compared to most on your list. When you get within sight of it however, you\u2019re surprised.\n\nThe entire village is in flames. You can hear screaming and yelling still coming from the place and the stench of blood and death is thick. You\u2019re getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nYou cautiously move towards the village and find where the majority of the voices are coming from. A mixed group of rough looking orcs, gnolls, and even a few hobgoblins are currently lording it over the remaining peasants they haven\u2019t killed.\n\nCurrently a couple of the women are being raped and they\u2019re torturing the shit out of several of the men. Despite the large amount of savage races, a human seems to be the leader. Figures.\n\nHe is addressing the peasants who are focused on him despite all the horror around them.\n\n\u201cKnow that you lot brought this on yourselves! All you had to do is provide food, basic goods and some time with your daughters, sisters and wives on a regular basis and this shithole of a town would be spared Green Eye\u2019s wrath. Instead you\u2019ve been hiring mercenaries to cut down our men for weeks! NOW you have to pay!\u201d the human bandit says.\n\u201cNO! I swear it! We\u2019ve done no such thing! We would nev\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d the human bandit snaps interrupting the older peasant trying to beg for mercy.\n\nThe human leader soon picks the old man up off the ground and stabs him in the throat before tossing him back on the floor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually give a shit if it WAS you or not! One of the villages in this area did, and when they get the message of what we\u2019re doing to your village, they\u2019ll fall in line, or they\u2019re going to suffer the same fate! Rape everyone in every fucking orifice, kill them all and shove their dismembered corpses on big fucking spiked sticks.\u201d\n\nGrim stuff.\n\nThe odd thing is you actually feel slightly sorry for these pitiful peasants since you probably inadvertently caused this. You were slaughtering so many bandits over last couple of months, you didn\u2019t think that they were actually united any way. You also didn\u2019t think that these bandit types would jump to the conclusions that the villagers were behind it. Though you suppose it makes sense that they would.\n\nAfter years of just ruthlessly drinking the living and seeing them as nothing more than blood bags, it seems odd that you would feel protective of them for some reason.\n\nMaybe, this is how Isabella feels about Dert in some ways. The people in that village are all food to her, but they\u2019re hers and she doesn\u2019t want anyone else fucking with them. You guess you\u2019ve developed a similar attachment. Who knew?\n\nYeah, you\u2019re not going to let bottom-feeding scum throw away perfectly good food\u2026\n\nYou enter the village, you don\u2019t even try to hide. You break the neck of three hobgoblins and put your fist through an orc before anyone even mounts an attack.\n\n\u201cShit! Get your dick outta that bitch, can\u2019t you see we\u2019re being attacked?!\u201d the human bandit shouts.\n\nThe gnolls clumsily attempt to chop you with their long axes, but its all too easy to avoid their blows and shatter their spines, you quickly shut their dog like howls up by stomping their heads into mush.\n\nThe remaining bandits fair no better against you.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too fucking fast! He\u2019s not human! He\u2019s not\u2026\u201d are the last words of a half orc before you finish him off, along with his buddies.\n\nSoon it\u2019s only the human bandit leader left and to his credit; he hasn\u2019t run off (like some of the hobgoblins tried to do)\n\n\u201cLet me guess\u2026vampire?\u201d\n\nYou nod silently.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026I had a feeling it wasn\u2019t just mercenaries after seeing the carnage on a couple of those sites. So are\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re done entertaining this lesser form, you rush forward and rip out his throat mid sentence. You drink his blood and throw his corpse next to the body of the old man he had just killed not a few moments before.\n\nMeanwhile the peasants that the bandits rounded up haven\u2019t even run. They\u2019ve all just huddled together watching you, probably with just as much fear as they had before you arrived.\n\nYou look upon them and they have never looked more like the herd of sheep they truly are. They are prey and always will be in their current form.\n\nYou have a mind to finish them all off, until one brave one approaches on his hands and knees.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you have saved us!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cSaved you? You shortsighted sheep, I only saved you because these assholes were killing off my livestock and I hate to waste food. I\u2019ve been feeding on you lot for months now. Didn\u2019t you even notice how some of you had gone missing?\u201d you say.\n\u201cWe\u2026we assumed perhaps the bandits had taken some of us in the middle of the night. But please, spare us your unholy wrath and we will worship you, my dark lord!\u201d\n\nWell this has turned interesting\u2026\n\n\u201cWorship you say? What exactly are you proposing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, we\u2026we can\u2019t defend ourselves against Green Eye\u2019s bandits and now that you\u2019ve killed this group, he\u2019s just going to send more to finish us off. You could defend us and in exchange we could provide\u2026what you need\u2026.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cI need blood you do know that right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but if it means just a few of us dying as opposed to all of us dying then it will be worth it. Please, I beg you. Whatever you wish, we will provide.\u201d\n\nThis could be just the thing to break up the monotony. It\u2019s also perfect due to the remoteness of it all. You\u2019d have people willing to give themselves to you, and the bandits you can just massacre as usual.\n\nOf course doing something like this might be slightly more involved than you\u2019d prefer. You can also imagine that it probably wouldn\u2019t be as cut and dry as you\u2019re going to want it to be.\n\nLot of factors still at play and you question if you want the headache.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept the challenge", "result": "What the hell it isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve got anything better to do. You\u2019ve been enjoying it more out here than Holgard anyway.\n\nStill you know this isn\u2019t going to be all fun and blood, so you need to start establishing rules.\n\n\u201cRise.\u201d You tell the man groveling before you.\n\nHe does so slowly before you.\n\n\u201cI will accept your obedience, but you must know what this means. This means tribute in blood when I call for it. This means anyone of you here could be called to sustain me in exchange for my protection!\u201d\n\u201cWe understand\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you truly do mortal. However, you soon will. And if you find my terms at any point unacceptable, there will be no negotiation; I will finish the job that the bandits failed to do and wipe out this entire village. Now, let us talk about your bandit problem.\u201d\n\nThe man who is the village\u2019s speaker says his name is Vic and explains the situation with the bandits.\n\nHe says Green Eye, is the unseen bandit leader that is believed to have made his hideout in an old abandoned dwarf mine in the hills nearby. As far as anyone knows, nobody in this village (or any other in the area) has ever seen Green Eye, except the bandits who mention him (or her) from time to time. Still never a physical description either except for the green eye that seems to unnerve them.\n\nVic says he understands that you will not be able to look over them constantly, but something must be done about the bandits soon since they will surely come looking to see what happened to their fellows and if that happens to be during the day\u2026\n\nYou tell Vic to not concern himself with it any longer because you\u2019re taking care of it tonight one way or another. He just needs to remember his promise to you. This village is yours and as such, he needs to get the rest of the people back to rebuilding it as soon as possible.\n\nAfter Vic gives you some basic directions on where the mine is located, you take your leave.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s not that difficult to find now that you know which way to go since you\u2019re catching the scent of foul savage races the closer you get. Eventually you get to the entrance, which doesn\u2019t even have anyone guarding it though judging by the smell and mess, this is definitely inhabited.\n\nThe mine is actually well lit, so you\u2019re guessing there must be more human types in here at least. You soon hear the sounds revelry and then in a large opening you see a group of mortals of varying races. Mostly the savage type like hobgoblin, orc and even an ogre. The human bunch doesn\u2019t surprise you. There are even a couple elves in the mix and at least one race you don\u2019t recognize.\nWhat does surprise you is the equal amount of female members in the group. There are a couple that are obviously bandits as well, but a lot of them just look like they\u2019re there for either \u201cfun\u201d or they have a large amount of children around them.\n\nYou didn\u2019t expect to find a community of sorts here. Makes sense that they\u2019re raiding the other villages for food and basic supplies rather than just valuables.\n\nIn any case, it hardly matters since you\u2019ve got a task to do\u2026\n\nYou kill three bandits before they even know what\u2019s going on, you then kill several of their fun women and the ogre before they all decide to stop trying to defend themselves and start running and hiding. The yelling, screaming and crying fills your ears and you realize with all the tunnels and crevices, it might take awhile to hunt everyone down, so you\u2019re going to make this easier.\n\n\u201cListen up to all those that value their miserable lives! The village of Maldito is under my protection and I am their bloody tyrant. Your actions against it have come to an end! Turn over Green Eye, and I\u2019ll allow the rest of you to slink out of here. Choice is yours.\u201d You shout.\n\nYou voice echoes throughout the mine a bit and then silence.\n\nA moment passes and just when you think you\u2019re going to have to hunt them all down anyway, you hear a thumping noise. Soon, you see a single short figure coming out from down a mine corridor; he carries some sort of rifle and is walking with a limp and a faint green glow is coming from the top of him\n\nYou then get a better look and he\u2019s a dwarf, which you didn\u2019t quite expect to be leading this rabble. He\u2019s dressed in heavy leather armor, though it might be just regular dwarven miner clothing for all you know. He\u2019s got an obvious metal leg replacing his missing one. His rifle isn\u2019t one of the usual designs you\u2019ve seen in Holgard. Has a wider barrel for one thing and looks of much better workmanship. Shiny even.\n\nHis face is that of a usual Dwarf, bearded, long hair and grizzled. Of course the main thing that sticks out about him is his green \u201ceye\u201d which you don\u2019t think is even an eye. It looks more like a glowing gem of some sort. If it has any magic properties, they aren\u2019t affecting you (yet). His other eye is non-existent and covered with a patch, so maybe the green one just helps him see.\n\nIn any case, the man obviously has no fear and has come out to meet you alone, which means he\u2019s either stupid or he\u2019s got something to say and hoping you might be in a mood to listen.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be one of those nights you see\u2026\n\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re Green Eye.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd I take it you\u2019re the one that\u2019s been fucking up my people. Edgrin said that he didn\u2019t think it was mercs and might be something worse like a vampire for example, but\u2026bah what\u2019s done is done now. I assume if you\u2019re going on about that shithole village that means you just killed him and all my people that I sent there to make an example of the place.\u201d Green Eye responds.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, and now I\u2019m here to kill you and everyone else here.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, and I don\u2019t doubt that you couldn\u2019t, though I would at least like to propose a different offer. One that you might find advantageous.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d\n\u201cAs you can see, much like Maldito, we are just a community trying to get by in this life. We are just happen to be predators rather than prey. I\u2019m sure you can identify.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstand, yes. Identify. No. Because if we\u2019re using food chain comparisons, then I would the top predator and you lot are in my way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVery well, I get it. How about this? We completely leave Maldito alone forever. There are more than enough villages in the area that we can shakedown. And to be quite honest, we probably don\u2019t need as much from them anyway now that you\u2019ve killed about half of us.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, those villages are also mine.\u201d\n\u201cCome on be reasonable. You just said that you have direct control over Maldito who apparently are filled with pleading peasants willing to do whatever you want. I mean unless you\u2019re planning on carving out an empire you really don\u2019t need all those villages. I might add, that it\u2019s beneficial to have us around.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how, you\u2019re just another competitor.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but you\u2019ve already made your point to us. I certainly have no plans on tangling with you ever again. Do you really believe that if you kill all of us, that there won\u2019t be another group of assholes to just take our place? Then what? You have to do this all over again and while you probably don\u2019t have any particular problems with that, you might not arrive to save your village like you did this time. These fucking mongrels and greenskins are stupid as shit and never learn lessons most of the time. I\u2019m probably the only thing keeping them all from idiotically just razing the entire area.\u201d\n\u201cSo what your saying, is I should leave you alive so the status quo can stay relatively intact and give myself less hassle in the long run.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to save my own ass, and the sorry asses of my community\u2026such as they are.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s intriguing enough for you to consider since it might be nice to just rule over the town without actually ever having to defend it again or wondering if you\u2019re going to stumble across a burnt husk of a village.\n\nStill, this can\u2019t be a negotiation that you feel comfortable with, without some sort of capitulation on Green Eye\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cThis sounds very nice and all, but at its core, this deal benefits you far more than me. I have no assurance that you\u2019ll keep your word. For all I know you\u2019re going to just bide your time and regroup. Perhaps even attempt to attack me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? What the hell are we going to do to you? We have no weapons to even hurt you with, I mean this rifle is mainly just to give me a sense of false security. You think we have any way to contact hunters even if we were so inclined? In fact I\u2019d argue that the villages you\u2019ve been feeding on would be more likely to do that than us.\u201d\n\nGreen Eye strokes his beard a bit and sees that you\u2019re not moved by his assurances.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think I know what you\u2019re getting at. You want tribute from us. Well how about this? We occasionally take women from the villages for\u2026recreation. Sometimes they go back, sometimes they realize that they like it here better. How about we take maybe one or two for you as a gesture of our goodwill?\u201d Green Eye asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good offer, but a child would be better. The blood of the youth always is.\u201d You say.\n\u201cA\u2026child? You want a kid?\u201d\n\u201cIs that a problem? The people that you sent to Maldito didn\u2019t seem to think so when they were planning to execute everyone there.\u201d\n\u201cThat was different and it\u2019s just that\u2026we don\u2019t normally\u2026I mean\u2026shit. Okay fine, we\u2019ll start taking children I guess. Um, how many did you need?\u201d\n\u201cOh not many. I mean just one every month is fine. Don\u2019t want to depopulate the area after all. And I\u2019d say it\u2019s more than fair to you.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it is. I accept your generous proposal.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you will, because it\u2019s the only option for you. Now then, I\u2019ll be expecting my tribute by the end of this month, have it waiting for me by the entrance, because if I actually have to set foot in this place again, it\u2019ll be the end of this community.\u201d\n\nGreen Eye nods and you turn to leave, though you\u2019re curious about one thing.\n\n\u201cOh, just wondering\u2026how does a dwarf become the leader of a bandit community full of savages anyway?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe mine dried up and I was too stupid to leave obviously.\u201d Green Eye answers.\n\nSatisfied with this answer you leave the mine.\n\nYou return home, nearly at dawn. Isabella doesn\u2019t ask what you\u2019ve been doing since she knows you\u2019ve been doing your usual routine of hunting in the wilderness or preying upon the villages.\n\nYou imagine she\u2019ll start asking questions eventually, she\u2019s probably going to nag you about your actions possibly attracting attention, but for now you\u2019re going to just enjoy your new hobby.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 31\n\nYou finish drinking your fill of the girl and release her though she still clings to you tightly like you\u2019re her entire world despite the fact that she\u2019s already married to some young man in this village.. As usual you have left this one alive since the less outright deaths the better. Besides, the more you feed on these peasants and don\u2019t kill them, the more they seem to be enamored with you. The fools believe your \u201cmercy\u201d is some sort of blessing.\n\n\u201cIs there anything else you require of me, m\u2019lord?\u201d she asks in a mild daze.\n\u201cActually now that you mention it, yeah. Now that I\u2019m done sucking on you, I\u2019ll give you the honor of sucking on me. You know what to do.\u201d You say.\n\nThe girl nods and slowly lowers herself before you.\n\nNow THIS is what being a vampire is all about, or at least what it should be. Lording it over the lessers and reaping the benefits. Not hiding on the outskirts of civilization.\n\nEver since this arrangement you\u2019ve actually been enjoying yourself again. Even more than when you used to go hunting in Holgard, which you haven\u2019t been going to at all anymore.\n\nAs for Isabella, she spends all her time in her precious garden and you\u2019re starting to wonder if she even cares what you do anymore as long as it doesn\u2019t involve messing with Dert or calling attention to your home. The only time she has asked you a question is she started wondering where you were getting all the children from since she was concerned you might be \u201cover farming\u201d Dert, but she seemed satisfied with your answer. She\u2019s benefiting so why should she care?\n\nThe girl finishes servicing you and then you send her home in a better status for her husband than before.\n\nTiring of your own time here tonight, you prepare to leave and exit the \u201chome\u201d that you use when visiting.\n\nBefore you leave however, you\u2019re met by Vic. Usually he knows better than to crowd you like this so it makes you a little wary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s close enough! Encroach on my personal space any further and it\u2019ll be the last! Now what is it that you feel the need to waste my time with?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was just wondering, since I\u2019ve been so loyal to you lord and helpful in in convincing the others to stay loyal\u2026I was just wondering if there would ever come a time that you might bless me with the same gift that you have. Not that I would be nearly as powerful as you of course m\u2019lord. I live to serve after all.\u201d\n\nThis again\u2026\n\nVic has brought this up before, and this topic has come up with more than a few of the ladies you\u2019ve been dining on.\n\nYou of course always give the same answer, that it isn\u2019t a \u201cgift\u201d that can be given so lightly and will only ever go to the worthy. Telling them that you can\u2019t make them vampires because you\u2019re not old enough to do it yet, wouldn\u2019t actually make you look like the \u201call powerful\u201d dark lord that you\u2019ve set yourself up as.\n\nStill, as far as you know you ARE able to make them into ghouls. Isabella explained all this to you in your first weeks as a vampire. She always said making a ghoul wasn\u2019t worth it since they are some of the most pathetic creatures she\u2019s ever had the displeasure of knowing. She made one once and killed it soon after because she found its habits too disgusting and its fawning far too annoying.\n\nOf course Isabella\u2019s personality is a little different than yours. You would probably be fine with more fawning. In fact absolute loyalty might be a plus. As for disgusting habits, well you wouldn\u2019t have to live with them on a regular basis and so what if they eat a few bugs?\n\nHowever, it still isn\u2019t something you\u2019re going to just do right away and would need to think on. After all, you turn one person or multiple people into a ghoul or ghouls, how are they going to act towards the rest of the normal people? Not like you can watch them constantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, now get out of my way!\u201d you say and knock Vic aside.\n\nYou head home pondering the possible ramifications of taking that extra step.\n\nWhen you finally do get home, you find that your night hasn\u2019t gotten less complicated.\n\n\u201cHave fun with your human whores?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cThought you\u2019d be in your garden. That\u2019s where you like to spend all your time isn\u2019t it?\u201d you say, not even answering her question.\n\u201cTrue, but perhaps I\u2019ve been sticking my head in the flowers for far too long and ignoring the situation that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat situation?\u201d\n\u201cThe situation where you\u2019ve apparently dominated an entire village to your will. Maybe even more.\u201d\n\u201cNo, just the one. What difference does it make? I\u2019m not attracting any attention and I\u2019ve been bringing children home to you on monthly basis.\u201d\n\u201cYes, which is why I haven\u2019t said anything, however I\u2019ve been noticing a change in your behavior with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou have? Surprised, considering all the time you spend in your garden.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, if you\u2019re bitching about us not spending enough time together, all you had to do is say something and I would have obliged. Since when have I not helped you out in any way I can? It\u2019s why you\u2019re here in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd THAT right there is the problem!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou treating me like a second class citizen around here!\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? I gave you fucking complete freedom!\u201d\n\u201cYou know that doesn\u2019t matter. Not really in the scheme of things. You\u2019re more powerful than me. You always will be and you will always see me as your lesser. Sometimes it feels like you scold me as if I was some child.\u201d\n\u201cWell when you act like one at times, that\u2019s what happens. And if I really saw you as my lesser, I wouldn\u2019t have even bothered with you in the first place. I saw something special in you, but obviously I was mistaken. Besides all that, don\u2019t give me that I never let you have fun business because it\u2019s not even true in the first place. If anything I\u2019ve been TOO permissive. You\u2019re on a fucking power trip right now and while I get it because you feel like you\u2019re getting the attention you feel you deserve, I\u2019m telling you right now that if you continue like this, it\u2019s going end badly.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand WHY you\u2019re giving me shit for this. You do the same thing with Dert, you\u2019re just less hands on.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. I\u2019m not rolling around in the pigpen with the pork chops! You\u2019re in there, not only rolling around with them, you\u2019re also fucking the pigs. AND don\u2019t even tell me that you don\u2019t do that, because you stink of humans most nights when you come back. Though I\u2019m not so much mad about that bit as I am severely disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying exactly?\u201d\n\u2018What I\u2019m saying is YOU are heading down a path that I\u2019ve seen play out several times with others I was close to in the past. Not really willing to go through it again.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what then? You\u2019re going to forbid me to do this then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, actually I\u2019m not. You\u2019re a free willed vampire, go play with your mortals and lord it over them. That seems to be what is making you happy. What I am saying however is if you insist on doing this though, you\u2019ll be doing it elsewhere because I\u2019m not going to sit by and watch the inevitable, let alone get caught up in it. Obviously you feel stifled here, so maybe you need to go do this anyway.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s done it for you. You\u2019re not going to get threatened by an ultimatum. You and Isabella haven\u2019t been getting along for a while now anyway. If she\u2019s giving you the option for a clean break now, you probably should take it while you can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be gone tomorrow night. I trust that will be okay.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cFine by me. You can sleep elsewhere in the crypt though, because you certainly won\u2019t be sleeping in my bed.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cYeah, probably for the best.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, it was fun while lasted and I hope you succeed in whatever it is that you\u2019re trying to achieve. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nAnd with those cold last words, Isabella turns and leaves you.\n\nWhile maybe you sort of knew this was coming for some time, there is a part of you that\u2019s going to miss Isabella. She did do so much for you, but ultimately you needed your freedom the most.\n\nAnd now you have it.\n\nThe next night, you leave the crypt with what little belongings you still have attachment to as quick as you can. You don\u2019t bump into Isabella; you assume she\u2019s in her garden as usual.\n\nYou make your way to Maldito, where you are met with the usual praise and submissive behavior.\n\n\u201cVic, get all your best builders and tradespeople together, I want a meeting with them.\u201d You order.\n\u201cUm, okay m\u2019lord.\u201d Vic answers.\n\nYou meet with them to let them know that you\u2019re going to be around a lot more often, so you want a proper home, rather than the simple empty one room house they just let you use when you are here.\n\nYour news is met with an overjoyed reaction for the most part, though you get the impression some are just reacting more out of fear of defying you. In any case, you aren\u2019t asking for much in the short term. Just a small underground area underneath the house you stay at.\n\n\u201cOh! So like a root cellar!\u201d one of them beams.\n\u201cYeah\u2026just like a root cellar.\u201d You answer rolling your eyes a bit.\n\nIn any case it\u2019s a simple enough task for them that you figure they won\u2019t take long in doing it. In the meantime, you have the unpleasant task of digging a hole in the forest and sleeping there. The first night is a real wake up call of how much better it was sleeping in a nice soft bed next to Isabella, but you need to get over that.\n\nA month passes and it\u2019s still not finished mainly because one of the more skilled carpenters had a heart attack on the job. You\u2019re pissed about this inconvenience, but it is what it is. In the meantime, when you make your usual meeting with Green Eye\u2019s community, you tell the guard at the entrance that you won\u2019t require a child every month anymore. Instead, they can just bring a girl like Green Eye originally suggested.\n\nBy the middle of the second month it\u2019s still not finished. You have no idea what the hell is holding these idiots up. Vic says something about the structural integrity is shaky and there being a danger over everything caving in. You\u2019re getting irritated to the point that you almost lash out and kill one of them, but then you realize you need these fools right now.\n\nSo you kill the tavern owner instead. Not like serving drinks is a job that requires special skills that you need. Besides, his wife can take over and she\u2019s more compliant to you anyway.\n\nYou start wondering if this would go faster if you made them ghouls. The main problem that you can see is that they\u2019re all weak humans that aren\u2019t even in the best of shape in the first place and require sleep and regular food. If you made them ghouls they\u2019d work for you tirelessly night and day. (They\u2019d be able to see in the dark as well) And they could eat\u2026well anything really.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really much stopping you now, since you now ARE here constantly to monitor their behavior.\n\nThough there is a real desire to still not do it too, since you\u2019d essentially be \u201crewarding\u201d them all for shit work so far. If you were going to do it, you\u2019d rather do for those that deserve it at least.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make some of them ghouls", "result": "You might as well start making ghouls if you\u2019re going to be using this place as your new home now. You\u2019ll feel safer if with absolutely loyal day guards around anyway.\n\nYou call everyone to the village square the following night. It\u2019s a little surprising for everyone, but of course they don\u2019t want to disobey you.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve gathered you all here because it\u2019s come up many times that some of you desire the same gift I have. This makes sense since you would indeed be better in every way and you would also be closer to your god. However, none of you are yet worthy of such a thing. In fact some of you never will be! Yet, I am a merciful master and as such I will bestow a minor bit of my power so that you may get a taste of it. Who knows, maybe in time you will impress me to the point that I will eventually complete your transformation.\u201d\n\nAt this point your words are met with signs of hope and excitement. You expected that, so that\u2019s one less thing to worry about. You\u2019re still wondering which people exactly to choose and how many. You probably want to pick the key members in the community though, so you figure you might as well give Vic what he\u2019s always wanted first.\n\n\u201cOkay Vic, come on over here and we\u2019ll get started.\u201d You say and cut your arm to drain some of your blood in a cup.\n\n\u201cUm, me m\u2019lord?\u201d Vic asks.\n\u201cYeah you! Who the hell else\u2019s name is Vic in this village? Now come on.\u201d\n\u201cUh, that\u2019s okay I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite worthy yet. I believe that there are many others here deserving of your gift more.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? You\u2019ve been begging me to turn you since I took control of this place. You\u2019re just nervous, come on.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I really realize now that I shouldn\u2019t have annoyed with my petty request as I did. I thank you for your generous offer, but perhaps one of the many lovely young women that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVic, stop being a bitch and get over here!\u201d you say raising your voice.\n\nAt this point the crowd is getting agitated with Vic\u2019s stalling and begin pushing him forward, telling him that he\u2019s a \u201cchosen one\u201d and he should be embracing this moment.\n\nVic slowly moves towards your position and then suddenly his eyes roll in the back of his head and he wobbles a bit before falling over.\n\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d you say shaking your head.\n\nOne of the other villagers goes over to help Vic, but after some inspection\u2026\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead m\u2019lord!\u201d the village \u201cdoctor\u201d exclaims.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cHeart attack it seems. I believe all the excitement of being a benefactor of your glory was too much for him.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d\n\nSomething about this doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n\u201cKick his body. In fact I want several of you to stomp on it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cM\u2019lord?\u201d someone asks.\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\n\nNot wishing to anger you, several of the villagers comply. Vic\u2019s body just absorbs the kicks and doesn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cOkay, I guess he\u2019s really dead, set his body on fire, no need to waste anymore time burying it. Actually never mind, there\u2019s a torch right here, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nYou take a nearby torch and go over to Vic\u2019s body. As you slowly lower the flaming piece of wood closer to Vic\u2019s body, you watch his eyes.\n\nYou watch\u2026\n\nThen just as you touch Vic\u2019s body with the actual flame, his eyes open and his entire form changes into a thin smooth gray skinned creature. Its face isn\u2019t anything like you\u2019ve seen before, having only slits for a nose, a simple line like mouth and its eyes are just white orbs.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d it shouts in different voice than before and immediately rolls away and attempts to scramble for safety.\n\nWhile the villagers are confused and scared by all this, you of course keep your cool and easily catch this creature and drag it into the empty house you reside at in the village to interrogate it.\n\n\u201cOkay, what the hell are you?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cPlease! I\u2019m a doppelganger and I\u2019m only doing my job!\u201d it pleads pathetically.\n\u201cBy job, you mean spying and infiltration! I only know ONE person that rules over a ragtag group of multi-racial misfits that might have the balls to do such a thing. How long have you been working for Green Eye?\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger wastes no time in selling out Green Eye. It says it\u2019s been with Green Eye for quite some time, but only was infiltrating Maldito shortly after you threatened Green Eye. It says it was originally masquerading as the head carpenter, but soon changed into Vic (and in both cases obviously secretly killed) when it realized you were serious about making the village your permanent home. It of course has been in contact with Green Eye off and on the whole time.\n\n\u201cSo what the hell is Green Eye exactly planning?\u201d\n\u201cWell originally he just wanted to keep a check on you, but when you made Maldito your permanent home, he got more concerned. I think he\u2019s planning on attacking you directly and most likely destroying the village.\u201d\n\u201cBecause that worked out so well last time. So what then has he hired hunters or something? Should have known he wasn\u2019t going to be above doing that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, actually he\u2019s been crafting silver weapons for everyone. Mostly daggers, but I know for a fact he\u2019s been focusing on silver shot for the few firearms we have.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s he getting all this silver from?\u201d\n\u201cThe mine I guess. Green Eye said it used to be a silver mine before it ran out.\u201d\n\u201cWell apparently it didn\u2019t completely run dry if he\u2019s got enough to scrap weapons together. Gotta hand it to Green Eye, though. He\u2019s been busy and I underestimated his fear of me. Smart of him to not tell me that it used to be a silver mine too. I didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what are you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cKill my enemy of course, might as well start with you. Wonder what doppelganger tastes like\u2026\u201d you say and prepare to bite.\n\u201cNo! Wait! Please! I could help even more! If you attack now, you\u2019d never get Green Eye. He\u2019s got a whole system of hidden tunnels, traps and shit. You might wipe out everyone under his leadership, but I doubt if you\u2019d find him. He knows those mines like nobody else.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d find him eventually.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe, but as I said, he\u2019s probably trapped the entire place too and considering he\u2019s been preparing for you, some of those might even be dangerous to you. Let me go back and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? You sold out Green Eye so quick and you were supposed to be on his side. How quick would you sell me out?\u201d\n\u201cBut this is different, I can see you\u2019re the more powerful force in this instance and I always side with the winning team. It\u2019s what my kind does. Green Eye doesn\u2019t know that you know that you know anything. In fact I can probably get him to meet with you. You\u2019re supposed to pick up your new tribute soon aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so?\u201d\n\u201cWell let ME go and pick it up. Except I wouldn\u2019t go as me, I\u2019ll go as YOU.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going to copy me?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And I\u2019m going to arrive at Green Eye\u2019s place during the day to do it. I will pretend that I\u2019m such a powerful and old vampire that I have the capacity to walk around in the daytime! This will throw them all off so much that they\u2019ll scramble to appease you quickly. When they drag out the girl, I will then claim it isn\u2019t good enough and that I will be back at night to renegotiate the deal with Green Eye personally. He\u2019ll be concerned enough that he\u2019ll meet with you, probably seeing if you have any other weaknesses, since thinking you can walk around in the daytime is going to cause him to discard his original plans. Of course it\u2019ll actually be you who\u2019ll meet him at night, at which point you\u2019ll easily be able to over power him and whoever else is with him. Trust me, it\u2019ll work!\u201d\n\nAn intriguing plan you suppose, you just aren\u2019t convinced though.\n\n\u201cSounds like a shit plan, and I still don\u2019t trust you. I don\u2019t think you can convincingly copy me anyway.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThe hell you say! I\u2019ll have you know that I am one the most skilled of my kind! I can easily copy you, right down to your quirky mannerisms. Especially since I\u2019ve been observing you for awhile now.\u201d The doppelganger says a little insulted.\n\u201cIs that so? Well prove it, and maybe I\u2019ll make a decision based on how good your performance is.\u201d\n\nYou let the doppelganger go and it has prepared itself to display its powers to you. It takes a bit longer to transform into looking like you than when it transformed back to its real form.\n\nThe first thing you realize is you haven\u2019t seen yourself in years. The dop looks like you, or at least what you looked like before you became a vampire, then again you haven\u2019t aged since then so that\u2019s presumably what you still look like.\n\nThe dop then begins to talk like you and act like you. It\u2019s very arrogant, condescending and just an all around dick.\n\nWhich means it\u2019s copying you exactly.\n\n\u201cSee? I can pull this off! Just give me a chance and hey, when Green Eye is dead, I could help you in other ways as well!\u201d the dop exclaims as it transforms back.\n\nIt certainly is an eager creature. You just aren\u2019t sure if you can trust it. And if you can\u2019t trust it, then why take chances?", "action_results": [{"action": "Trust the doppelganger", "result": "You\u2019re not so much trusting the dop, so much as you\u2019re going to take a chance that it fears you enough that it\u2019s being honest. Since if it IS telling the truth and willing to work for you, he would come in pretty handy.\n\nStill, you\u2019re going to be careful as you can about this.\n\n\u201cOkay, first of all, are you absolutely SURE this plan is going convince Green Eye to meet with me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, I am. If he thinks something is wrong, but fixable he\u2019ll more often than not take a personal approach to it even if it might risk his life, just like when he first spoke with you. If I know him, he\u2019ll probably want to appease you so he can give himself more time to re-think a new strategy of how to deal with you if he believes you can walk around in the day time.\u201d The dop says.\n\nYou can\u2019t really tell due to its nearly featureless expression, but it sounds confident in its words. You suppose that will have to do.\n\n\u201cAlright then, we\u2019ll try the plan.\u201d You say.\n\u201cY\u2026you will? Oh thank the gods! I swear I will be loyal to you!\u201d the dop exclaims.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see, but first I need to prepare you a bit.\u201d You say and move towards it.\n\u201cPrepare?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just relax a bit, don\u2019t move and\u2026 brace yourself!\u201d\n\nYou suddenly lunge on the dop who is taken by surprise by your speed. You bite the dop in the arm and drink a little of its blood. It actually tastes pretty terrible and you nearly spit it out.\n\nIn the meantime the dop is making a horrible screaming noise and doesn\u2019t stop until you smack it upside the head.\n\n\u201cStop that, it\u2019s annoying.\u201d You say and release it.\n\u201cY\u2026you bit me!\u201d the dop says rubbing its arm.\n\u201cSure did. Call it an extra precaution in case you get the bright idea to try to betray me. I can always sense where you are now. So if any of this goes south, I\u2019m going to know where to find YOU immediately.\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger might have those empty white orbs for eyes, but you can still see the fear in them. Honestly, while you will be able to sense it if it\u2019s close by, you aren\u2019t going to be able to instantly track it from anywhere. Still, it doesn\u2019t know that.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to betray you.\u201d The dop whines.\n\u201cWell, now I know you won\u2019t. Now you stay here, I\u2019m going to go get one of the villagers so you can blend in again. I\u2019ll drain them and you can walk out like nothing happened. The body can be disposed of later.\u201d you answer.\n\u201cWait which one?\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference does it make? I dunno the tavern keeper\u2019s wife I guess. Might as well considering I already killed her husband. Plus it\u2019s an easy enough task even for you and you\u2019ll hear all the village gossip at lot easier, not that it matters I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cMm, okay. I don\u2019t have to worry about you suddenly picking on me to bite now and I prefer female forms anyway, it\u2019s always easier when the gender matches.\u201d\n\nYou pause for a moment.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026you\u2019re female?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell we doppelgangers are pretty flexible about it all for obvious reasons, but yes, I personally identify as female. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d she says.\n\u201cUm, no not really. I mean you\u2019re just a smooth gray nearly featureless being. It\u2019s not like I can see tits or anything. I mean\u2026I can\u2019t even see a hole down there\u2026or anywhere for that matter; then again I haven\u2019t really been exploring. I guess if you were a guy it would have been more obvious I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOh you solids with your constant exposed reproductive organs. We doppelgangers transcend such concerns since we only display them when necessary such as for sex or expelling waste. Until that time they remain hidden and protected.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well however works\u2026don\u2019t really want to know, but if that\u2019s the case how the fuck was I supposed to be able to tell that you\u2019re female or not?\u201d\n\u201cBy my eyes of course! Those of my kind that identify as female tend to change our eye color to white while those that identify as males tend to change them to black.\u201d\n\u201cWhat color are they normally?\u201d\n\u201cOh gray.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Very illuminating. Next time I run into one of you doppys, I\u2019ll try to remember all that.\u201d\n\u201cErm, could you please not call me a doppy? It is considered offensive to my\u2026\u201d\n\nYou glare at the doppelganger as your patience wears thin.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026nevermind. Just happy to serve and being included, sir.\u201d She says submissively.\n\nYou leave the house and find that a minor crowd has gathered from a safe distance. They\u2019re probably wondering what exactly happened, time to make up a story.\n\n\u201cIs that\u2026thing gone m\u2019lord?\u201d someone asks.\n\u201cYes, of course it is. Didn\u2019t you hear its death scream? I interrogated it first though. Apparently those bandits I thought I took care of have regrouped and will be trying to attack again. However, we know the truth now and can prepare. I\u2019m going to track them down and finish them off for good, however I\u2019m still going to bless some of you and when I do, you will be charged with helping the defense of this village. I trust you all will be up for the challenge should it come to that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course m\u2019lord! We all will!\u201d\n\u201cThen we will start tomorrow night, for now though I wish to spend time with you. The rest of you go home and worry no longer about any of this.\u201d You say and point to the tavern owner\u2019s wife. She goes over to you immediately.\n\nAs the crowd disperses and obeys your command, you head into your home with your victim.\n\nYou don\u2019t bother with the foreplay and get straight to the feeding. You\u2019ve done this with her several times already, but this time will be different for her. As usual she puts up no resistance and even as you\u2019re obviously killing her she still whispers \u201cI love you\u201d in your ear and holds you tightly.\n\nYou finish her off and drop her body to the floor. Meanwhile the dop was watching the shadows. You look at her and from her body language she cringes a bit.\n\n\u201cGeez\u2026 you really are ruthless. I mean I\u2019ve seen you on occasion drink people, but\u2026never quite like that. She said she loved you and you just\u2026look I just want to remind you, I am definitely NOT going to betray you.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it, now stop wasting time and take her form or whatever it is you do.\u201d\n\nThe dop wastes no time and soon there is a \u201cnew\u201d tavern keeper\u2019s wife\u2026actually you find out her name was Kayla. The doppelganger knew her better than you actually did, despite you feeding on her on a regular basis.\n\nAfter \u201cKayla\u201d leaves to get more acquainted with her new role, you look around to make sure you can dispose of the real one safely. You aren\u2019t sure why you\u2019re bothering being so secretive since the villagers would probably be fine with a doppelganger if you told them to be fine with it.\n\nHowever, you do think it\u2019s probably a good idea to slowly introduce such things to them. While they may accept you as a master, they may be less willing to accept some other non-human lurking about as well.\n\nAt least not until you make some of them non-human.\n\nThe next night you start again with what you originally planned. This time you pick a married couple at random and decide to see how it goes. You give them both some of your blood which causes them to gag a bit and then generally feel \u201cweird.\u201d\n\nThe pair of them eventually stagger back home, and you tell Kayla to keep an eye on them both since you won\u2019t be able to observe them during the day.\n\nA couple days and nights pass and you repeat the process with them and just when you\u2019re starting to get frustrated, they start to show a change. The pair of them become more fawning than usual towards you and you don\u2019t even have to do anything. They\u2019re also paler and beginning to move in a less normal fashion. It\u2019s more of a loping gait. Their appetite becomes a lot less normal as well.\n\nYou think you\u2019ve finally changed them into ghouls. You\u2019re glad it didn\u2019t take as long as Isabella once suggested it would if you attempted it.\n\nHowever, you soon discover all her warnings were correct. First off, they ARE very annoying with how much they\u2019re underfoot all the time. Still, they are very obedient and they soon finish digging out the area meant to be your new resting place under the house. It\u2019s crude, but you figure it can be worked on continually. For now though it\u2019s functional enough that you don\u2019t need to sleep in a hole in the ground in the forest nearby.\n\nKeeping them subdued when you\u2019re asleep is another matter however. While you attempt to tell them to stand guard over you, they\u2019re little like children in that they get bored and have short attention spans.\n\nWhile they haven\u2019t actually attacked anyone yet, they\u2019re acting aggressive enough that it won\u2019t be long. This naturally causes some of the other villagers to be wary and now that\u2019s potentially messing up your relationship with them.\n\nTo counter act this, you give a few intimidating speeches, re-hyponotize a few of the key villagers again and have the two ghouls whipped before the mob and scold them for their behavior. The pathetic creatures soon learn that they aren\u2019t going to be chewing on their neighbors anytime soon. Still, it does make other villagers less eager to want to become ghouls now, though you\u2019re sort of wondering if it\u2019s worth it anyway.\n\nWhile you\u2019re trying to keep a precarious balance of humans and non-humans together through your powers and plain old fear, Kayla reminds you that it will soon be time for her to meet with Green Eye\u2019s people and start part one of that plan. You originally thought you might send one of the ghouls with her, but that would probably just confuse them, or they\u2019ll fuck up the plan and they might even eat Kayla. So she\u2019s going alone. You\u2019re still fairly concerned about this, but this is what you\u2019ve decided on, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nYou don\u2019t even go to sleep that day; you stay awake mostly pacing in your underground sleeping area. You send Stinky and Fatty (Your new names for your ghouls since you never bothered to learn their real names) to go fetch you a \u201cdrink\u201d so you can keep your strength up. You also tell them to keep an eye out for Kayla.\n\nAt any moment you fully expect to hear the sounds of an attack above you. You aren\u2019t going to be able to help, so you hope Stinky and Fatty are up to the task.\n\nHowever, the pair of them eventually come back with Kayla who is back in her human form.\n\n\u201cHere she is master!\u201d Stinky says excitedly.\n\u201cDid we do good?\u201d Fatty adds.\n\u201cYeah, now get the hell out of here. Go dig up one of the corpses in the forest and reward yourself or something.\u201d\n\nYou hardly need to tell them twice and they both leave you alone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m back and it\u2019s done. I made enough trouble that Green Eye will be willing to speak with you tonight. I didn\u2019t really want to be at Green Eye\u2019s any longer than I had to anyway, let alone directly confront him. Fairly certain that gem eye of his sees through disguises. In fact, I highly suggest that you not talk to him and just attack as soon as you see him, lest you fall under his command.\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? I\u2019m a fucking vampire. I am the one who commands.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know you\u2019ve got powers of your own, but it\u2019s that gem eye. It\u2019s magic. How the hell do you think he got that motley bunch to work for him?\u201d\n\u201cYou seem immune considering you\u2019re selling him out.\u201d\n\u201cWell I imagine that might be a combination of being a doppelganger, along with not being in his presence for an extended period of time. Whenever I was though, I felt the urge to serve him. I mean think about it, he managed to convince YOU not to wipe out his group the first time around. How the hell did he do that? I like to think I\u2019ve gotten to know you well enough that you\u2019re not really a man that takes chances on potential future threats so you sparing him and everyone else seems a bit out of character.\u201d\n\u201cI spared and took a chance on you.\u201d\n\u201cTrue I suppose, but still\u2026I dunno I\u2019m just saying you probably shouldn\u2019t speak with him just to be safe.\u201d\n\u201cYour concern is touching. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s dark about now, I\u2019ll be heading out with the ghouls then.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well did you need me for anything else then?\u201d\n\u201cNot right now and assuming you haven\u2019t set me up, I will remember your actions on this task.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave of Kayla to go get your ghouls. You find them quite easily in the forest nearby finishing off a corpse. One of them hits the other and points at you.\n\n\u201cThe master is coming! The master is here!\u201d Fatty says excitedly and runs up to you until you smack him down.\n\u201cI need the pair of you to accompany me to an important meeting. When we get there though don\u2019t do anything until I say so.\u201d\n\nFatty and Stinky follow you happily as you make your way to Green Eye\u2019s mine. You feel like you\u2019re walking into a trap the entire time, but at least you\u2019ve got some help. Normally you wouldn\u2019t even be concerned, but you haven\u2019t rested or fed too much so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a full strength either.\n\nEventually you see the mine and you also see a short figure surrounded by several figures at the entrance. They don\u2019t look like his usual men though. They\u2019re all female and look very cowed for one thing.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell considering you arrived here in broad daylight demanding your tribute and then saying it wasn\u2019t good enough, I figured I\u2019d offer you a selection. All of these girls are from the nearby villages.\u201d Green Eye says.\n\u201cWhat if I want them all?\u201d\n\u201cWell then I guess you\u2019re getting them all, far be it for me to fight a vampire that can walk around in the daytime. Interesting trick. Didn\u2019t know you guys could do that. Almost hard to believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell you saw it with your own eye.\u201d\n\u201cActually I didn\u2019t, I got the report second hand from one of my men. Granted I trust him\u2026or rather I trust that he believes what he saw, but let\u2019s just say, I have some questions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to answer yours.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I\u2019m going to ask anyway, because I strongly think something weird is going on here and I\u2019d rather we talk than it come to violence.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would, because you\u2019d be on the losing end of that deal.\u201d\n\u201cMost likely, but are you so sure? I see you\u2019ve brought two friends with you, meaning you\u2019re smart enough to not take this meeting lightly.\u201d\n\u201cChoose your next words carefully dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cI always do. I have a hunch that we\u2019re both being set up to kill each other. I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve been talking with that treacherous dop haven\u2019t you? I bet that\u2019s even who impersonated you. It\u2019s a liar you know. All of their kind are, and I should have known better than to have one in my community. Our relationship has been cordial and can remain that way. I will even increase the tribute. We don\u2019t have to fight.\u201d Green Eye says.\n\nSomething is very weird about all this. Green Eye seems a lot more relaxed than you are right now and with how much he\u2019s talking; it feels almost like he\u2019s stalling you for some purpose. Maybe he\u2019s got his men hiding elsewhere to ambush, but there really isn\u2019t any place to hide nearby.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s pointed out potential treachery of the doppelganger makes you suspicious though. For all you know Green Eye\u2019s telling the truth.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack", "result": "Whether you\u2019re getting set up or not isn\u2019t the issue. The fact remains Green Eye has obviously still been spying on you at best and gearing up to kill you at worst. You can deal with Kayla when you return because you don\u2019t intend on dying tonight.\n\n\u201cKill everything!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cSHIT! FIRE!\u201d Green Eye shouts back.\n\nStinky and Fatty both advance forward and every one of the girls that looked so submissive, suddenly draw pistols out from their clothing and Green Eye raises his own large barreled rifle.\n\nWhat happens next is a bit of a blur. Your speed, your ghouls and the nervousness of the girls helps you avoid most of the shots, however at this close range you still catch one to the leg.\n\nThis is enough to cause you to stumble long enough for Green Eye to pick his shot, which would have probably hit you in the head, if it wasn\u2019t for Fatty taking the silver bullet straight to his body and ripping his gut open and tearing up his insides.\n\nYou roll out of the way to avoid being crushed by the falling ghoul, and scramble to get to Green Eye who is already in the process of taking his next shot. Meanwhile most of the girls that fired at you are either running, or they\u2019re being mauled by Stinky.\n\nYou grab one of the girls that was trying to run and throw her hard into Green Eye. His shot goes wild as she hits him. By the time he recovers, you grab his rifle and then break it over his head. He falls and then you grab the girl you just threw and sink your teeth into her neck for a quick taste that you don\u2019t even finish. You then toss her dying bleeding out body aside and refocus your attention back to Green Eye who is trying to get back up.\n\n\u201cOBEY VAMPIRE! O\u2026\u201d he shouts as one last attempt to stop you.\n\u201cNot likely.\u201d You answer and then rip out his green gem eye.\n\nGreen Eye (Now No Eye) screams in agony as you crush the gem. You aren\u2019t entirely sure if it ever had an effect on you, but no point in taking chances.\n\nHe tries to pathetically kick at you from his prone position, but even with silver lodged in your leg, you easily move out of the way.\n\nHe shouts a bunch of curses at you, some that are probably dwarven, but you finally put an end to his flailing with repeated stomps to his head.\n\nIt\u2019s done. Green Eye is dead and all the bitches that were shooting at you are either dead or run off. Stinky is busily eating one of them, unconcerned with her dead husband lying nearby. You guess she\u2019s probably just happy eating and that you\u2019re alive.\n\nYou have no idea if you rest of Green Eye\u2019s people are lurking in the mine or if they fled ahead of time. Chances are, without Green Eye\u2019s leadership, whatever remains of the \u201ccommunity\u201d isn\u2019t going to stay together anyway. You suppose you could go hunt them down if they are in the mines, but honestly you\u2019re a little wary that Green Eye might have set up a system of traps or something to get you in case he failed. You see no reason to bother playing in tunnels trying to avoid traps and ambushes with a wounded leg.\n\nInstead you start destroying to support beams around the entrance and eventually you cause a cave in. If anyone is hiding inside, they\u2019re going to have a hell of a time digging their way out.\n\n\u201cCome on Stinky, let\u2019s go home.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDid I do good?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cA lot better than Fatty, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nStinky makes a weird laugh and snuffles about looking for a choice piece of meat to take with her on the way home.\n\n\u201cOh that reminds me\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nWhen you get back to Maldito, you toss the mushy decapitated head of Green Eye towards the feet of a nearby villager who is standing \u201cguard\u201d as a night watch. He\u2019s a little horrified by the head, but stays put wondering what this all means.\n\n\u201cRejoice citizens, Green Eye and his band of cutthroats truly are no more. I have finished them off utterly. Spread the word.\u201d You announce.\n\nYour words and actions of course get the desired effect of praise from the villager, who immediately runs off to tell everyone (and considering that it\u2019s fairly late, waking most of them up).\n\nYou tell Stinky to go find something to do since you\u2019ve got something important to take care of. She complies and runs off back into the forest.\n\nYou head to the tavern and apparently it\u2019s a slower night since not many are in. Kayla is cleaning a glass with a bored expression Everyone though looks when you enter.\n\n\u201cEveryone except Kayla leave. Celebrate the death of our enemies outside.\u201d You say.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to say it twice, everyone obeys and Kayla puts down the glass she\u2019s cleaning.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026I take it you killed Green Eye?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cHe had some interesting things to say about you before I did.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Probably was trying to save his own skin.\u201d\n\u201cProbably, but I get the impression he wasn\u2019t completely wrong. Tell me the truth, did you sort of set that up hoping that we\u2019d probably kill one another? Maybe just side with whoever came out the winner?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I knew you\u2019d win. I mean you obviously had more power than Green Eye who was essentially a crippled dwarf with a bit of magic to help him. As I said, I am loyal to you now.\u201d\n\u201cNow. Interesting choice of words. Sort of implies you might not be in the future.\u201d\n\nYou stare at Kayla who begins to look very nervous.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026um\u2026you gonna kill me too?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cShould I kill you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cProbably not doing myself any favors, but I suppose if you wanted to play it safe, you should. However, I of course would rather you didn\u2019t. I said I could continue to help you and I meant that. There are other villages nearby, and I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t take those over as well. I can help.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right. The little pose as me, walking around in the daytime trick to make out like I\u2019m a REALLY powerful vampire.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a bad idea, you have to admit. It\u2019ll keep the rest of the ignorant villages guessing of when you\u2019ll show up or not. Plus you\u2019ll be able to directly take tribute, instead of relying on Green Eye now.\u201d\n\u201cStill don\u2019t see why I really need you. I mean I could easily put the fear into any village all by myself. I can create ghouls for the daytime.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you trust your creatures completely to not mess things up? I think we both know the answer to that. Perhaps they do learn in time, but honestly you can\u2019t afford to wait around forever for them.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, this sounds all very nice, about you wanting to serve and all of that, however WHY?\u201d\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you want to serve me, why are you helping? You can transform into anything. Surely you could probably say go to the Delantium Kingdom and pose as an aristocrat\u2019s wife and live a safe pampered life without much concern. Why risk serving a vampire for not much reward and the threat of violence done upon you? In fact why were you serving Green Eye for that matter? I can\u2019t imagine that was much better.\u201d\n\u201cWell as I pointed out, Green Eye\u2019s magic gem had a little to do with my servitude to him. As for you, well you already bit me. You made it quite clear you could find me anywhere now so what\u2019s the point in me even leaving? I might as well try to make the best of this situation. Also, on top of being afraid of you, you\u2019re using your vampire powers on me, compelling me to stay.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve done no such thing actually. And if I were, you wouldn\u2019t even be aware of it. Well at least I don\u2019t think you would be.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not aware that you\u2019re doing it. You are very alluring you know, and I have no idea why because you\u2019re even more\u2026abrasive than Green Eye was.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re wondering if Kayla\u2019s on to something, maybe your powers are getting stronger and you have a more \u201ccommanding aura\u201d now. You know you always felt it a bit with Isabella and it didn\u2019t really ever go away until she made you independent.\n\nYou also wondering if you\u2019re starting to miss Isabella in some way. Not really on the physical side of things since you got the village girls for that (Though they aren\u2019t as good as Isabella of course) but just in other ways. For example, while you definitely don\u2019t want a return to someone being above you, you are starting to find it a bit boring talking with people that are quaking in fear all the time. You didn\u2019t think you would, but then you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be in this position either.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s ALL on me huh? Somehow I\u2019m really not buying it. I feel like you have some sort of agenda.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, I suppose if you feel that way then I guess your choice is clear. Could you please try to not make it painful?\u201d Kayla asks a bit meekly.\n\u201cWill you stop with that already? I\u2019m not going to kill you\u2026well at least not today. I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you probably weren\u2019t rooting for me to get killed though you probably wouldn\u2019t have been that broken up about it if I had. Also I\u2019m intrigued enough by you that I\u2019d like to keep you around. It\u2019s somewhat more interesting to speak with someone who isn\u2019t completely fearful of me every once in awhile.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve made it quite clear on many occasions that I am quite afraid of you.\u201d\n\u201cEh, yeah, but it\u2019s not the same as the rest of the mortals out there. Not to mention I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as afraid as you claim you are. But that\u2019s okay, since we seem to be on the same page with future goals, speaking of which we should start talking about those.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, you\u2019re in charge after all.\u201d\n\nYou and Kayla begin you discuss your plans.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 34\n\nMaldito; the village of ghouls and your ruling capital.\n\nThough you aren\u2019t exactly sure now if what you\u2019re ruling is worth all that much.\n\nGreen Eye was terrorizing the villages in the area long before you showed up and was still terrorizing them for you when you arrived. It wasn\u2019t hard to intimidate them into submission.\n\nIf you killing their former tormenter wasn\u2019t enough to do it, then you being a vampire certain was. Kayla posing as \u201cyou\u201d in the daytime, was just overkill.\n\nMaldito was eventually ghoulified completely, so if a village steps out of line, you\u2019ve got an \u201carmy\u201d to threaten them with. Though once again, it\u2019s overkill considering you could wipe out every one of the villages yourself. The ghouls are just if you need something done in the daytime instead.\n\nGhouls really are the most loathsome creatures you\u2019ve ever had to be around. Everything about them disgusts you. Their habits, their sycophantic behavior, their smell, everything. They\u2019re lower than humans and you\u2019re surrounded by them, but at least their loyalty is certain and they watch during the day.\n\nThis is what \u201cruling\u201d does to you, makes you paranoid. Even with as scared as you have the rest of the villages, you still believe that one of them is going to get brave enough to actually do something about it.\n\nMaybe to some degree you\u2019re even hoping one will just to break up the monotony.\n\nStill it\u2019s all yours and you don\u2019t answer to anyone. You aren\u2019t sure if these are really the \u201cbest times\u201d though. Something is missing. You spend a lot of time trying to remember the \u201cgood old days\u201d but really when were those?\n\nCertainly wasn\u2019t when you were enslaved by Ral, though you suppose your brief time with Lisa was the exception. You still wonder what happened to her, hopefully she\u2019s doing better than you, if she\u2019s still alive.\n\nWasn\u2019t when you had to spend time as a magically altered freak either. Once again, your only bright spot with that was Heather trying to help you. You\u2019ve been thinking about your brief reunion with her in some of these moments of introspection and you still don\u2019t feel bad about it, but you do think that she probably didn\u2019t deserve it. Just bad timing.\n\nWhen you were with Isabella? Well there were a lot of good times you\u2019ll admit, but if things were truly that good, you wouldn\u2019t have left. You can only imagine if Isabella saw you now, she\u2019d probably just be shaking her head at you. She\u2019d probably even be right to do so. She always did know better, but then you were meant to be free and that\u2019s always been your problem.\n\nEven now, ruling all these worthless peasants, you still feel like a prisoner. You haven\u2019t really been free since your days as a petty thief with your sister.\n\nNow THOSE were the good old days. You wish you could go back to those times if only for a little while.\n\nAs you sit in your own underground lair (Now properly built) you sense someone living approaching. It\u2019s Kayla. You still don\u2019t know her real name, but dops don\u2019t really have them anyway so you just continue calling her by a dead tavern keeper\u2019s wife. She doesn\u2019t even use that form anymore and just stays in her \u201cnatural\u201d one when around Moldito. She only uses human forms (or yours) outside the village.\n\nYou\u2019re still a little mystified of her exact intentions. She\u2019s been with you for a couple years now and hasn\u2019t shown any sign of leaving or betrayal. You can\u2019t imagine that she\u2019s entirely happy with her lot. She\u2019s not a ghoul and she isn\u2019t a fearful ignorant human either. You\u2019re in charge and YOU\u2019RE not entirely happy, so why would she be?\n\nShe has said in the past that she\u2019s happy serving you, but really have a hard time believing that. You\u2019re a tyrannical dick. Unless, she\u2019s in love with you, but that would be weird. You actually have been actively not using any sort of suggestive powers on her just to see how she acts. Besides, she\u2019s never given that indication though again, maybe you\u2019re just bad at reading the signs of a doppelganger.\n\n\u201cUm, am I disturbing you sir?\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cNot really, just living up to the stereotype of the brooding vampire I suppose. What\u2019s going on?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cUh, dunno how to tell you this, so I might as well come out and say it, but I was doing my usual routine in one of the villages and apparently they\u2019ve caught the attention of hunters.\u201d\n\u201cHunters?\u201d\n\u201cYes, apparently a group of them were investigating the village of Ulig recently. Now I don\u2019t know if anyone said anything outright, but due to all of their suspicious behavior they might have inadvertently told the hunters something anyway. Many of the villagers I overheard seemed to be worried that they did that accidently.\u201d\n\u201cWell how many of these hunters were there and where are they?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re currently in Sibogri, but they may be coming here soon. I dunno exactly how many there are, but apparently a sizable group. Ten maybe? Maybe more. I feel like this really can\u2019t be a coincidence and someone must have told someone about all this.\u201d\n\u201cWell obviously, if there are that many. I don\u2019t even think there were that many when they were in Holgard and that was a huge city. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is so many due to them hearing rumors of a day walking vampire.\u201d\n\u201cApologies sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you apologizing for?\u201d\n\u201cThe daytime thing I know was mainly my idea and I was just apologizing to you for bringing this upon you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding? This is probably the most excitement I\u2019ve had in awhile. Besides, I imagine that hunters would have come around here eventually.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad or concerned about all this?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, it\u2019s actually a motivator.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Well what were you planning on doing then?\u201d\n\nWell that is the question isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe obvious thing to do would be to fight, but given how you\u2019ve been feeling lately, you could probably very well just leave. Where would you go? You have no idea, but it\u2019s an option.\n\nIn the meantime\u2026\n\n\u201cKayla. Why are you still here?\u201d you suddenly ask.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave sir. Apologies.\u201d Kayla responds.\n\u201cNo, not that! I mean why are you still here?\u201d\n\u201cIs\u2026this a test?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Look, what I\u2019m asking and there is no right or wrong answer here, is why are you still here? I mean are you in love with me or something similar?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026not exactly\u2026it\u2019s complicated. Can we talk about something else?\u201d\n\u201cBesides the hunter thing, this day is becoming the most interesting one in years. I should have asked this question years ago. What\u2019s so complicated? You either are or you aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKayla is silent for a moment due to the awkward spot you\u2019ve put her in. You can see her trying to come up with an answer and after some thought\u2026\n\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s still not simple, but I can try to explain if that will please you.\u201d Kayla answers.\n\u201cWell better than nothing I guess. Go ahead.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cAs a doppelganger, we do tend towards those with power. Eventually we tend to imprint upon them unless someone better comes along. I suppose that explains why I was with Green Eye for so long. However, I was also planning to kill him eventually and take his place. That\u2019s sort of what we do.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re basically admitting to me, that you were planning on killing me all along.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. Look, you just admitted that you were planning to kill me. I think it would be in your best interest to explain in more detail.\u201d\n\u201cI honestly haven\u2019t really been planning to kill you though. I mean I assumed I would at some point, but considering I\u2019m already impersonating you most of the time and reaping some of power thrill directly when I\u2019m doing it, the feeling isn\u2019t as strong. Muted in fact.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that you created a bunch of ghouls that I wouldn\u2019t be able to control since they know I\u2019m not really you. Not to mention I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to kill you, so I\u2019m sort of stuck and now it\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m comfortable in my position and don\u2019t really feel a desire to leave. I mean I could, but I\u2019d probably feel really lost for a while as I tried to find a suitable role equal in status to this one and that\u2019s not the greatest feeling for a doppelganger.\u201d\n\nWell more enlightenment on the race of doppelgangers, but you notice she didn\u2019t entirely answer the original question. Doesn\u2019t matter you suppose, you\u2019re going to do what you want anyway, but there is one more important question.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if I fight these hunters, you aren\u2019t going to suddenly switch sides again?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNot likely sir. Hunter types tend to be nomadic and have no real hierarchy. Also they are constantly seeking out vampires and the like to kill. I already know enough about vampires that I don\u2019t want to be hunting them on a regular basis. I\u2019m with you sir.\u201d Kayla responds.\n\nWell, that\u2019s something you guess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNever expected anything different sir. So how are we going to go about this?\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cWe need to gather a bit more information. If they aren\u2019t staying in the villages themselves, then that means they must be making camp in the forest. Maybe send Stinky\u2026no wait not her. Send Lurky, to scout the nearby forest area. He tends to be quieter and smells less pungent than most of the other ghouls. I want you to keep doing your usual routine of blending in at the other villages. Try to gather as much information as possible. As for me, I\u2019m going to start building up the defenses on this place. Probably should have done it years ago.\u201d\n\u201cYou think you have time to build a wall?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I once was a rogue and I knew how to set traps. Didn\u2019t do it often, but I knew how. If the hunters storm this place, it isn\u2019t just ghouls and me; they\u2019re going to have to deal with. The only thing I\u2019ll need to worry about are the ghouls accidently setting them off, but I think I can probably make them understand where they can go and where they can\u2019t. Let the rest of them know though, that I\u2019m going to address them all as soon as it goes dark, so they all better be around.\u201d\n\nKayla nods and goes to carry out your orders. Meanwhile you work on a few things until it\u2019s dark so you can address your ghouls.\n\nYou address what\u2019s going on to your ghouls who of course all listen intently. They\u2019re actually eager to go fight right now, but you tell them there will be time for that soon. You tell them to start digging holes and placing sharpened sticks, spikes and then camouflaging them.\n\nNot all the houses are used in the village anymore since the ghouls seem to all like just staying outside and only really enter the bigger village hall if the sun especially bothers them. You deicide to trap some of these abandoned homes since you imagine the hunters will be meticulous enough to search every home.\n\nYou spend the next few days doing this and then eventually you get a report from Kayla who has some interesting news.\n\n\u201cWait, so they\u2019re torturing people?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah and they apparently got people doing this in several villages. They aren\u2019t letting anyone go either.\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cHow many of these assholes are there?\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t have an exact number, but it\u2019s looking like more than ten. Maybe fifty and I don\u2019t think this is just hunters, the Church of Joachim is getting mentioned a lot, along with terms like purging and cleansing.\u201d\n\u201cShit, this is a fucking crusade. How the hell did we not see something this large coming?\u201d\n\u201cWell we are a bit isolated even compared to the other villages, but I apologize sir, I probably should have noticed something sooner.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s done now. Lurky hasn\u2019t even come back yet, so who knows if he\u2019s still alive. This is starting to look like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. What the hell am I really fight for anyway?\u201d\n\nKayla doesn\u2019t respond, she just shifts a bit nervously at your rise in temper.\n\nYou think about your options, and just flat out leaving seems like a perfectly valid one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fight", "result": "It may not be much and you may not entirely be satisfied with it, but this is your home for now and if you\u2019re ever going to leave it, it\u2019s going to be on your own terms, it won\u2019t be due to getting run off.\n\nYou calm down a bit and gather your thoughts.\n\n\u201cOkay, if these are also Joachimites that we\u2019re also dealing with, they\u2019re also going to have holy men and possibly even a little magic. We can\u2019t really afford to just wait for them to come to us, because I\u2019ve run into these fanatics back in Holgard and they will absolutely kill every villagers if they think it\u2019s Joachim\u2019s will.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the human gods, and nothing about Joachim, but from what I heard, I don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cWell generally the Joachimites are supposed to be pacifists, but occasionally you get a very militant sect and they can make a follower of Karn look like pussies by comparison. In any case, this could work in our favor. If they\u2019re torturing the hell out of the villagers, those same villagers are probably looking for their undead savior. Meaning me. Now I could go at night, but I\u2019d like to keep up the illusion of walking around in the day. So I want you to take about twenty ghouls including Stinky and go wipe out any hunters or Joachimites at Ulig for starters. I also want you to encourage the villagers to start resisting the fanatics a lot better than they have been doing obviously.\u201d\n\nKayla doesn\u2019t look confident in your orders.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cProblem?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhile the ghouls leave me be and some of them will even listen to me if I say the orders come from you, but you\u2019re asking me to herd twenty of them into battle. I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to listen to me like that.\u201d\n\u201cJust say I\u2019m giving the order or hell, bring Stinky and I\u2019ll tell her and she can relay the rest\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh, not that sir. I\u2026um\u2026the ghouls don\u2019t like me. Never have. I think they believe I shouldn\u2019t be so close to you when none of them get to be. I mean if it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019d attack me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course they would, but I\u2019m here, so they won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to be totally obedient to me. Even when I\u2019m in your form they don\u2019t like it. I believe they find my scent offensive.\u201d\n\u201cWait, they\u2019re offended by YOUR smell? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever detected any sort of scent from you. It\u2019s as bland as your near featureless appearance.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s problem. I\u2019d probably have more success if I smelled more like you.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you getting at exactly? You saying you need to rub up against me or something?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was suggesting something a little more than that. If we could be physically intimate, I believe I could adequately copy your scent and commanding presence\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve practically got an army of religious fanatic vampire killers beating down your door and Kayla wants your dick. You\u2019d laugh if this situation wasn\u2019t so serious\u2026actually you laugh anyway.\n\n\u201cAre you seriously telling me you want to have sex with me right now?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI know it seems like a weird time given all that\u2019s going on, but it really would help with the task you\u2019ve assigned to me.\u201d Kayla responds.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see...fuck it. If it\u2019s going to help, let\u2019s get to it. However, you\u2019re going to have to change first. I mean maybe you\u2019re a beauty right now to other doppys, but you\u2019re just not doing it for me in your natural form.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable. Um, is there any particular form you would like?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, surprise me? Wait, on second thought, don\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\u201cI think I know of a form that will please you. I\u2019ve heard you describe her enough to me that I think I can copy her.\u201d\n\u201cWait, who are you\u2026oh.\u201d\n\nAnd before your eyes, you see Kayla transform into the image of Isabella, well ALMOST the image of her. She\u2019s not a perfect match since she\u2019s only working by your description and one major thing that\u2019s standing out is the eyes. Her eyes are still those blank white orbs.\n\n\u201cWell? Does this work?\u201d Kayla asks a bit hopefully.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019ll have to, because we don\u2019t have time for you to get it perfect. Well let\u2019s get this done. Now is there anything I should know about? I mean you aren\u2019t going to start transforming into a gray blob or something in the middle of this are you?\u201d\n\u201cNot unless you want me too sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood and no I don\u2019t. Okay, come over here.\u201d\n\nKayla comes over to you and the first thing she does is kiss you on the lips and puts her arms around you. It\u2019s weird, for multiple reasons. Least of which is because you\u2019re embracing something that looks like \u201cIsabella\u201d but obviously isn\u2019t her. While you appreciate the attempt at illusion, those white orb eyes are destroying it.\n\n\u201cHold on, stop.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cNot as such, but\u2026you\u2019re going to have to turn around and bend over for this.\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n\nDuring the act, Kayla takes every opportunity to insist that you rub her body and press up against her as much as possible as she wants to get your full \u201cessence.\u201d While she said she wasn\u2019t going to turn into a gray blob during this, she starts having a very \u201csquishy\u201d feeling to you. It\u2019s almost like her body is partially melding on to yours.\n\nShe tells you to hold her tighter and goes on about how good this all feels to her. You\u2019re a little reluctant to do so since it isn\u2019t like Kayla\u2019s a vampire and you could easily break her if you used all your strength, but then again, you partially feel like you\u2019re fucking water. And that of course makes you concerned that she\u2019s going to envelope you or something.\n\nNone of that happens though, and after an \u201cinteresting\u201d time with Kayla, you feel even weirder about it all and there\u2019s a sticky gray coating on most of your body.\n\n\u201cEw.\u201d You quietly say to yourself.\n\u201cThat was wonderful! I\u2019ve never known someone so intimately like that! I could really feel all your power! It was all so intoxicating! Mmmm.\u201d Kayla says and continues to rub up against you and putting your arms around her body.\n\nShe\u2019s in complete ecstasy and while you\u2019re not surprised due to your magnificent sexual prowess, there\u2019s shit that needs to be done.\n\n\u201cLook, you think you can take lead the ghouls now?\u201d you say and start separating yourself from her. (Which isn\u2019t easy since you seem to be literally sticking to her)\n\u201cYes, I think it should be easier now.\u201d\n\u201cGood, get going. I want this done.\u201d\n\u201cVery well sir.\u201d\n\nKayla looks a little disappointed that you\u2019re already shoving her out the door, but you had no plans on making this a permanent \u201cthing\u201d anyway. It\u2019s going to be a little weird now though.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t want low morale so\u2026\n\n\u201cKayla, just remember if it starts looking bad, make a strategic retreat. I can always make more ghouls, but I can\u2019t replace you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy thank you sir! And I will, but hopefully it won\u2019t come to that.\u201d Kayla responds with a smile before transforming into you and leaving.\n\nWell, now things are going to be even weirder, but you\u2019ll worry about that later.\n\nAll you can do now is wait and hope that the attack is successful.\n\nAs it gets dark, you start to grow impatient and begin to suspect the worst, but Kayla returns. Not many ghouls follow her, but she\u2019s back. She knows how much you hate interacting with \u201cyourself\u201d so she transforms back into her natural form.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back, I was just about to go to Ulig myself. I trust it was a success?\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt was, though as you can see, there were many casualties. Most of the ghouls I took with me died, including Stinky. A lot of the villagers were also massacred as well, but I believe they are more determined to fight against the fanatics after my speech to them.\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s the start. I\u2019m going to head to Yilbov. It\u2019s the next closest village to us and hopefully they don\u2019t know what\u2019s gone on in Ulig yet, but I trust you let nobody escape.\u201d\n\u201cNo, none of them fled in the first place. They fought to the death.\u201d\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to give them.\u201d\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t you want anyone to go with you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to do this myself and stealthy because they\u2019re probably going to be even more alert for trouble. Better if I go alone rather than having ghouls tipping my hand. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve done it this way, so it\u2019ll be fun for me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish sir. Just be careful. The hunters and Joachimites we encountered were well prepared. Silver shot, silver weapons, even bombs.\u201d\n\u201cNot surprised but\u2026\u201d\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to complete your sentence, you see a ghoul running towards you. It\u2019s Lurky. He looks severely wounded.\n\n\u201cMaster! Master!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cLurky? Thought you might be dead. What the hell happened to you?\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI almost was! Caught and tortured! There are many many hunters and those crazy worshippers in the forest! A large camp!\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cLots! Well\u2026none now.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you telling me that YOU killed them all?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t even kill one! Had help! Someone like you!\u201d\n\u201cSomeone like me? Wait\u2026another vampire?\u201d\n\nBefore you even put the pieces together, a familiar figure arrives and gets all the ghouls attention in town. It isn\u2019t due to her naked body though, it\u2019s because this is a woman of great power and dominance.\n\n\u201cSir\u2026is that\u2026\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s her and if she\u2019s here, it can\u2019t be good.\u201d\n\nIsabella has arrived and judging by the look of distain on her face, she\u2019s not in the best of moods.\n\nShe throws several ghouls out of her way and tells them to back off. They comply, but the fact they\u2019re all in awe of her and ignoring you completely is telling of how much power she\u2019s currently displaying. Even Kayla looks a bit entranced by her.\n\nIsabella approaches you and you just stand there like prey.\n\nFortunately she just slaps the hell out of you. You take it since you don\u2019t have much choice and nobody is rushing to help you either.\n\nYou rub your face and address Isabella.\n\n\u201cHello Isabella, you\u2019re looking as lovely as \u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking flatter me, I know how good I look! Ugh\u2026this place\u2026its crawling with ghouls. I don\u2019t know how you can stand the filth or the smell. I feel dirty just standing here. I understand you need humans to kick around, but I thought I taught you better than to associate with ghouls. Have you REALLY looked at the company you\u2019re keeping?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m well aware Isabella.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? Because I think if you thought about it, you\u2019d realize that hanging around with humans, ghouls, and\u2026shit\u2026I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d Isabella says temporary distracted by Kayla.\n\u201cI\u2019m a doppelganger. Heard much about you. Pleasure to meet you at last.\u201d Kayla says with a little bow.\n\nIsabella turns back to you.\n\n\u201cWell, at least you have someone around here with a little class I guess.\u201d\n\u201cIsabella, what are you even doing here? I thought you never wanted to see me again.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cAnd I would have been glad to oblige. However, your actions here had consequences. Severe ones. Did you really think that you could just conquer a bunch of villages and it NOT cause any attention? My home is ruined thanks to you.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose its more fool me for not paying more attention to your actions, I just didn\u2019t expect you to stir up a fucking crusade. The large group of Joachimites and hunters marched through Dert and burned the entire village. The poor dumb bastards never even knew there was a vampire living nearby.\u201d\n\u201cThey destroyed Dert?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and by the time I found out about it, the crusade had already moved on towards your area. I might have known sooner, but I had already stocked up on villagers previously and had food for a while. In any case, my reliable food source was destroyed and I went to hunt the assholes who did it. Eventually I caught up with them and found your minion getting tortured. After killing most of them with only one or two managing to get away, I turned my attention to him. Of course your loyal minion told me everything that he didn\u2019t tell his captors for obvious reasons, however I sort of suspected you were the cause of all this anyway. I warned you and you didn\u2019t listen. You never listen\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd you feel like you\u2019re in the crypt again\u2026\n\nStill, as usual she\u2019s sort of right. Doesn\u2019t mean you like it though.\n\n\u201cOkay, I get it. So I take it you\u2019re here to help?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHelp? Well that is an interesting dilemma. If you weren\u2019t involved, I\u2019d probably finish off the rest of these fanatics and hunters myself and be on my way, but considering that you are involved, I\u2019m tempted to just take off and leave you to deal with the rest of the situation. I\u2019ve probably killed enough of them to qualify as revenge and it\u2019s not going to change the fact that I need to find a new place to live since my livestock has all been killed.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just go to Holgard or prey upon travellers nearby?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I suppose I could, but ugh\u2026that\u2019s not ideal. Then again neither is looking for a new home. In any case, I\u2019m still not convinced on helping you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026Miss\u2026Isabella? If I may\u2026\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cActually under normal circumstances, you may not, however since I\u2019m more willing to listen to a complete stranger right now rather than my ex, you might as well dare to address me. Say what you have to doppelganger.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cI\u2026we\u2026would be most grateful for your help. While you may have eliminated a great camp in the forest, there are still many enemies currently occupying the villages in the nearby area and as you said, one or two from the camp you destroyed got away. I can only imagine they are already on their way to warn their fellows which means they will be more prepared. I think we would be able to handle this situation much easier with your superior skills assuming you wish to help us, oh great mistress of the night.\u201d\n\nIsabella cocks her head to the side listening to Kayla trying to appeal to her sense of vanity.\n\n\u201cWhere did you find this one? It\u2019s good at this. It\u2019s respectful without being excessively annoying like a ghoul or quaking in fear like a human, and it almost comes off as sincere. It may even be sincere. However, I\u2019m not actually interested in hearing your minions beg on your behalf. I\u2019d rather hear YOU do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for? I mean you either care enough about your revenge or you don\u2019t. I mean I was planning on taking care of this myself before you showed up anyway\u2026\u201d\n\nKayla suddenly goes over to you.\n\n\u201cSir, I really think we should take her help. There are an awful lot of hunters still alive and we would probably lose less humans and ghouls with your ex helping us. It will just be better in the long run.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Ask Isabella for help", "result": "It would be the pragmatic thing to do. Isabella is a lot more powerful than you are and at the very least, it\u2019ll make all of this go a lot easier and quicker. You put up with Isabella\u2019s superior attitude for years, you can put up with it for this small moment.\n\nAlso there is a small part\u2026well a little more than small actually, that misses her.\n\n\u201cIsabella, and I do mean this sincerely, I would like your assistance on this task. I fucked up, and should have thought about consequences of trying to carve out some sort of empire of sorts. Especially when I don\u2019t have much help to begin with. I got drunk with power and overly confident about everything. So again, if it will appease you, I\u2019m begging for your aid.\u201d You say.\n\nIsabella looks at you as you try to look as humble as possible to her.\n\n\u201cNice. Not as convincing as your doppelganger though.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m being sincere! I really do want your help!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know you do and I even know you mean it, but my concern is, are you actually going to LEARN from any of this? I seriously have my doubts about that. Chances are when all this is over, you\u2019ll go right back to doing the same thing, perhaps even believing that you\u2019ll do it better next time.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not helping.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, stop presuming my actions!\u201d Isabella snaps.\n\nThere\u2019s a pause and then Isabella shakes her head.\n\n\u201cBy the gods I\u2019m too sentimental for old flames sometimes\u2026\u201d she says to herself.\n\n\u201cI will help you, but this is the last time! If you decide to continue acting like an idiot after this, you\u2019re on your own. Okay, give me the lay of the land so I know exactly where we\u2019re attacking.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Isabella is given a map of the area and told where certain places are specifically, she seems uninterested in the specifics and repeatedly says she\u2019ll take care of most of the remaining villages tonight and any remaining ones she\u2019ll deal with tomorrow night.\n\nIn the meantime you proceed with your own plan of going to Yilbov. Kayla stays behind with the ghouls.\n\nBy the time you get to Yilbov, it feels like a very familiar scene. Namely when Green Eye\u2019s men were pillaging Maldito, though minus the rape and double the torture and burning alive.\n\n\u201cFOLLOWERS OF THE EVIL SPAWN MUST BE PURGED! THE WILL OF JOACHIM DEMANDS IT! NOW REPENT AND ACCEPT THE MERCY OF JOACHIM BEFORE THE RIGHTEOUS FIRE CLEANSES YOUR FILTHY SOUL!\u201d\n\nSeveral villagers are tied to stakes and begging for their lives. Some are saying they were forced to serve you, others claim ignorance, and none of it does any good of course. The fanatics are burning some infidels tonight and that\u2019s that.\n\nMeanwhile there are several hunters patrolling the village in groups of two. You manage to actually take out four of them before alerting everyone to your presence. It was a good try at least.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S THE VAMPIRE! KILL IT! KILL IT NOW!\u201d the head zealot shouts and quickly burns the rest of the villagers tied to stakes.\n\nGunfire, crossbow bolts, and silver throwing knives are all fired or hurled in your direction. It\u2019s a bit chaotic with all the villagers running around, but at least some of them are taking hits for you, though perhaps not voluntarily.\n\nYou take down several Joachimites, before the head zealot calls forth a beam of light from his hands and aims it at you.\n\n\u201cFEEL JOACHIM\u2019S BURNING LIGHT, DEMON OF THE NIGHT!\u201d\n\nYou feel it all right too, and it hurts like hell when it briefly hits your chest. You quickly get a nearby villager to use as a shield, but it doesn\u2019t work, you soon smell flesh burning as the beam burns right through the villager.\n\nYou get temporary relief by ducking behind a house. The problem lies with the zealot being on a high platform in an open area and his spell seemingly following you without error. You peek behind the corner and see that he\u2019s still yelling about killing you all the while his victims are screaming and burning close around him.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering your best move to get to him, you get shot in your side by a hunter. His next shot would have been your head had you not been quick enough to dodge. You rush the hunter and break his neck with ease and trying to ignore the pain of the silver now lodged in your body.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026need to finish this asshole. What this\u2026oh this might work.\u201d You say and find a spherical metal object on the body of the hunter. It\u2019s a firebomb.\n\nYou grab it and the body of the hunter and go to face the zealot again.\n\n\u201cYOU CANNOT HIDE BLOOD LEECH! THE LIGHT WILL ALWAYS FIND YOU!\u201d the zealot says as his light beams hit the body of the hunter.\n\nYou smell the burn and it won\u2019t be long before it goes through, but you hopefully don\u2019t need that long.\n\nYou throw the firebomb at the zealot, which misses, but it didn\u2019t need to hit him and you weren\u2019t aiming at him anyway. You just needed it to hit one of the burning villagers near him.\n\nBefore you know it an explosion occurs showering the entire area with wood, flames, and body parts. You continue to use the body as a shield. Last thing you need is a random piece of wood flying into your heart.\n\nAfter the destruction has died down a bit, the remainder of the Joachimite fanatics clumsily try to bash your head in with silver cudgels. They fail and join the rest of the dead.\n\nAnd there are certainly a lot of them. This village is in complete ruins. Most of the villagers are dead or hiding, a few though are angry.\n\n\u201cYOU! You brought this upon us all! Even Green Eye was better than this! You\u2019ve been preying upon all of us and it stops today!\u201d someone shouts and then you feel a silver bolt in your back.\n\n\u201cAgh! Fuck! Ungrateful wretches!\u201d you exclaim and turn your attention to the group of peasants that have grabbed hunter weapons to finish you off.\n\nThey have about as much success as they did. Your wrath is swift and brutal. After putting down the minor peasant revolt, you address any villagers still around, but hiding.\n\n\u201cIf you still wish to live under my protection, you had best find shelter in the nearby village of Ulig. If not, then I suggest you take to the wilderness now, and forget about this place for the rest of your short lives.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave of the village and head back home. A little slower than usual due to all the silver in the side of your body. You\u2019re going to have to get Kayla to help fish the stuff out.\n\nEventually you get back home and find that Isabella is already in your lair and speaking with Kayla! They\u2019re seemingly having a friendly conversation as well.\n\n\u201cOh that doesn\u2019t surprise me, he\u2019s always been like that. I think his parents must have\u2026 oh speaking of which, look who just came back. Sheesh, you look a little worn.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cUm, welcome back sir! I was just talking with Isabella.\u201d Kayla says a bit more nervously.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been finding Kayla an excellent conversationalist and it\u2019s rare I find those.\u201d\n\u201cHm, while you two were talking I\u2019ve been getting shot full of silver! I thought you were going to help!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI did and I finished.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026but\u2026you couldn\u2019t have! How many villages did you get to?\n\u201cThree. Five was how many you had right? You already dealt with one and I assume you just dealt with the other. Also, I managed to save most of your little humans in the process. You know what your problem is? You have too many villages to look after. You should just group all your followers in one big place. It\u2019ll be easier for you to rule that way, if you\u2019re going to insist on doing this.\u201d\n\nYou have no words you just sit down still in pain. You think Kayla is going to ask if you\u2019re okay or go see to you, but instead she continues to hang around Isabella.\n\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s a good idea Isabella. See? Isn\u2019t it good you begged her for help?\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cBest idea ever obviously.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay I know what the problem is, your girlfriend isn't showing you proper attention, am I right?\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you answer.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Kayla stutters.\n\nIsabella looks at the pair of you back and forth.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what you two are right? I mean I\u2019ve gotten a vibe between the pair of you and I\u2019m usually not wrong on these sorts of things.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d you say.\n\u201cUm\u2026I suppose it\u2019s complicated.\u201d Kayla responds.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so complicated? Not like anyone else is in the middle of this\u2026wait, he\u2019s not fucking a ghoul is he? Because that would be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking a ghoul!\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? You two are fucking right?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d you say.\n\u201cUm\u2026it\u2019s complicated.\u201d Kayla responds again.\n\nIsabella start to laugh a bit and you\u2019re getting annoyed. Kayla just remains silent.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so fucking funny?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYou of course. We\u2019re not together, do you actually think I care what you\u2019re fucking now?\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, look since I\u2019m not going to get a straight answer from you, I\u2019ll ask your girlfriend. Have you two been intimate? Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we have, but it was only once and I sort of talked him into it because it was part of a plan.\u201d Kayla answers.\n\u201cOh this just gets better. Talked him into it huh? I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t need to try very hard.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve had a good laugh, but I don\u2019t see why this is any of your concern.\u201d You say.\n\nIsabella stands up and gives you a serious look.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why, because your actions have had consequences in my life for quite some time. From the moment you showed up at my crypt begging me for Gray Moss for Ral, to the moment when you had that frozen curse and even now you brought a crusade on my doorstep. You\u2019ve been quite troublesome since we met, but I\u2019ve been talking with Kayla here and I\u2019ve found some illumination which I didn\u2019t expect to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be despite it all, I\u2019ve always helped you out because I like you. And because I do, I\u2019m going to go back on my word and help you again.\u201d\n\nAnd before your eyes, Isabella spins around and with one quick move she rips Kayla\u2019s head off and throws it across the room and into the wall behind you. You stand up as Kayla\u2019s headless body leaks gray goo from the body.\n\n\u201cSHIT! What the fuck did you do that for?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t actually love it did you?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cNo! But\u2026she was a useful servant!\u201d\n\u201cShe was serving nobody but herself. I talked with that one long enough to see that. You can\u2019t trust doppys.\u201d\n\u201cThought you said you never saw a doppelganger before.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t, or at least not one in its natural form, but in any case I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t know anything about them. You don\u2019t live for centuries without reading tomes and books about things every now and then. That doppy had sex with you, meaning it most definitely gathered enough of your presence to take the next step, which was to copy you perfectly, dispose of you and take over.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, that can\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. Have I ever lied to you?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose not, but still\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHell, it was getting friendly with me when you weren\u2019t here. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it would have turned into you and then later some where down the road tried to get close to me in your form. Wouldn\u2019t have worked of course, I would have known that it wasn\u2019t you. Anyway, I should get going, it\u2019ll be dawn soon and I\u2019m going to have to dig a hole in the ground. It\u2019s so undignified, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I told you I was just here to help. What, you weren\u2019t hoping I killed the doppy because I wanted to get back with you did you?\u201d\n\u201cWould it really be so bad?\u201d\n\nIsabella walks over to you and kisses you.\n\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019re obviously in different places right now. Tell you what, assuming you survive another century, come find me in the Delantium Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cYou not going back home?\u201d\n\u201cNo, because you\u2019re most likely going to still be fucking around here and possibly drawing attention to yourself again, plus it\u2019s not going to be the same with Dert gone. Besides maybe I need a change of scenery anyway. Going to miss the garden, but I can make another one elsewhere, better maybe. Who knows? See you around.\u201d\n\nYou watch as Isabella walks toward the exit of your lair, but before she leaves she stops.\n\n\u201cBefore I go, tell me. When you were intimate with the dop, did she look like me at the time?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cWell\u2026 sort of\u2026but not quite. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI knew it.\u201d\n\nIsabella laughs and leaves.\n\nIt\u2019s been an eventful night and you\u2019ve got a lot to do tomorrow night, but for now, you\u2019re going to get some rest.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Refuse Isabella's help", "result": "Considering Isabella has seemingly already wiped out a majority of the fanatics, your task is going to be a lot easier now. She\u2019s already helped enough; you aren\u2019t going to beg her for more help especially if she\u2019s going to be telling you what to do the whole time.\n\nYou still like her and all, but there was a reason you didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cIsabella, I appreciate the assistance you have already given, but I think we can all handle it from here.\u201d\n\nIsabella briefly looks insulted, but she quickly hides it. Seems she figured you\u2019d give in.\n\n\u201cI see. Well if that\u2019s how you feel about it, then I shall take my leave. Good luck I suppose. I mean that in general, since even if you do succeed I doubt you\u2019re actually going to learn any sort of lesson from it all. I can imagine that the same thing will happen again five years down the road and I\u2019m certainly not going to be anywhere near here when it does. Guess I\u2019ll see what the Delantium Kingdom is like this time of year. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Isabella takes her leave.\n\nKayla suggests that you reconsider, but you tell her to remember her position, as it isn\u2019t her call in the first place.\n\n\u201cVery well sir didn\u2019t mean to overstep my boundaries.\u201d She says.\n\u201cI\u2019m going Yilbov, I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d You say and take your leave as well.\n\nBy the time you get to Yilbov, it feels like a very familiar scene. Namely when Green Eye\u2019s men were pillaging Maldito, though minus the rape and double the torture and burning alive.\n\n\u201cFOLLOWERS OF THE EVIL SPAWN MUST BE PURGED! THE WILL OF JOACHIM DEMANDS IT! NOW REPENT AND ACCEPT THE MERCY OF JOACHIM BEFORE THE RIGHTEOUS FIRE CLEANSES YOUR FILTHY SOUL!\u201d\n\nSeveral villagers are tied to stakes and begging for their lives. Some are saying they were forced to serve you, others claim ignorance, and none of it does any good of course. The fanatics are burning some infidels tonight and that\u2019s that.\n\nMeanwhile there are several hunters patrolling the village in groups of two. You manage to actually take out four of them before alerting everyone to your presence. It was a good try at least.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S THE VAMPIRE! KILL IT! KILL IT NOW!\u201d the head zealot shouts and quickly burns the rest of the villagers tied to stakes.\n\nGunfire, crossbow bolts, and silver throwing knives are all fired or hurled in your direction. It\u2019s a bit chaotic with all the villagers running around, but at least some of them are taking hits for you, though perhaps not voluntarily.\n\nYou take down several Joachimites, before the head zealot calls forth a beam of light from his hands and aims it at you.\n\n\u201cFEEL JOACHIM\u2019S BURNING LIGHT, DEMON OF THE NIGHT!\u201d\n\nYou feel it all right too, and it hurts like hell when it briefly hits your chest. You quickly get a nearby villager to use as a shield, but it doesn\u2019t work, you soon smell flesh burning as the beam burns right through the villager.\n\nYou get temporary relief by ducking behind a house. The problem lies with the zealot being on a high platform in an open area and his spell seemingly following you without error. You peek behind the corner and see that he\u2019s still yelling about killing you all the while his victims are screaming and burning close around him.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering your best move to get to him, you get shot in your side by a hunter. His next shot would have been your head had you not been quick enough to dodge. You rush the hunter and break his neck with ease and trying to ignore the pain of the silver now lodged in your body.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026need to finish this asshole. What this\u2026oh this might work.\u201d You say and find a spherical metal object on the body of the hunter. It\u2019s a firebomb.\n\nYou grab it and the body of the hunter and go to face the zealot again.\n\n\u201cYOU CANNOT HIDE BLOOD LEECH! THE LIGHT WILL ALWAYS FIND YOU!\u201d the zealot says as his light beams hit the body of the hunter.\n\nYou smell the burn and it won\u2019t be long before it goes through, but you hopefully don\u2019t need that long.\n\nYou throw the firebomb at the zealot, which misses, but it didn\u2019t need to hit him and you weren\u2019t aiming at him anyway. You just needed it to hit one of the burning villagers near him.\n\nBefore you know it an explosion occurs showering the entire area with wood, flames, and body parts. You continue to use the body as a shield. Last thing you need is a random piece of wood flying into your heart.\n\nAfter the destruction has died down a bit, the remainder of the Joachimite fanatics clumsily try to bash your head in with silver cudgels. They fail and join the rest of the dead.\n\nAnd there are certainly a lot of them. This village is in complete ruins. Most of the villagers are dead or hiding, a few though are angry.\n\n\u201cYOU! You brought this upon us all! Even Green Eye was better than this! You\u2019ve been preying upon all of us and it stops today!\u201d someone shouts and then you feel a silver bolt in your back.\n\n\u201cAgh! Fuck! Ungrateful wretches!\u201d you exclaim and turn your attention to the group of peasants that have grabbed hunter weapons to finish you off.\n\nThey have about as much success as they did. Your wrath is swift and brutal. After putting down the minor peasant revolt, you address any villagers still around, but hiding.\n\n\u201cIf you still wish to live under my protection, you had best find shelter in the nearby village of Ulig. If not, then I suggest you take to the wilderness now, and forget about this place for the rest of your short lives.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave of the village and head back home. A little slower than usual due to all the silver in the side of your body. You\u2019re going to have to get Kayla to help fish the stuff out.\n\nWhen you return Kayla does indeed tend to your wounded body. She\u2019s very attentive and even offers you some of her blood to keep up your strength and help with the healing process since there aren\u2019t any humans around.\n\nYou take her up on her offer, since while her blood is horrible tasting, you can\u2019t afford to be a chooser right now. You tell Kayla that tomorrow morning she needs to take ALL the ghouls to one of the villages and wipe out all the enemies there as well.\n\nYou rest up for most of the day, hoping that the attack goes successfully and a counter attack doesn\u2019t occur while you\u2019re trying to rest.\n\nFortunately Kayla returns, unfortunately she\u2019s gotten half of the ghouls killed in the process. The other half is in various conditions ranging from somewhat bruised to missing a few body part.\n\nKayla also says that most of the village was destroyed and not even by the fanatics. There were too many ghouls for her to control properly and some of them ran amok. By the time she got them all back under control and eliminated the fanatics, most of the villagers were either dead or they fled.\n\nSo while you officially won, you lost the village, worse, you lost the humans in it. Kayla is obviously no general, and while yelling at her makes you feel slightly better, it doesn\u2019t really solve anything. You just realize you\u2019re going to have to redouble your efforts at the fourth village.\n\nLater that night you head to Goloki with your ghouls and you have more success, but probably not much more. In fact, it\u2019s a good thing you took your ghouls otherwise you might have been in trouble.\n\nYou\u2019re wounded several times and lose a good number of ghouls. You do manage to keep more villagers alive. After drinking a few of them to heal yourself somewhat, you tell the survivors to head to Ulig. You think after all this is over, you\u2019re just going to have your people in one village. It would be a lot easier to rule them that way.\n\nYou eventually stagger back to Moldito and once again Kayla tries to tend to you as best she can. She asks if you\u2019re sending her with the remainder of the ghouls to attack the last village in the morning, but given her last two attempts resulted in heavy losses, you tell her, you\u2019ll just take care of it tomorrow night.\n\nAfter giving a few general commands to her, you go to your room to try to rest. This is taking it out of you more than you thought it would. It really is a good thing Isabella took out the main camp, but you\u2019re starting to wonder if you let your pride get in the way of making things easier.\n\nYou quickly dismiss such thoughts and eventually close your eyes to rest.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you sleep for, but you\u2019re suddenly woken up, by the sounds of battle above you.\n\n\u201cShit! Don\u2019t tell me they counter attacked\u2026\u201d you say to yourself getting up.\n\nNobody has come down to your lair yet, not even Kayla or ghouls, so you assume that they\u2019re defending. Must have been sudden if nobody informed you.\n\nIts still daytime, so there\u2019s little you can actually do except wait for someone to come to you. You could go up and try to give orders from the ground floor inside your home, but that\u2019s a dangerous position. A couple of those bombs that the hunters like using so much could blow it up and if not get you completely in the blast, it would destroy the house on top of you and probably expose you to the sun. You\u2019re also not healed completely, so it would be better to just save your strength and wait for them to come to you.\n\nIt is frustrating just waiting around though. You start wondering if the traps you set are working, how many hunters you\u2019re going to have to deal with and if Kayla\u2019s dead or not. You chalk up Kayla being dead since she probably would have come to you by now and while she can look like you, she isn\u2019t actually you, and doesn\u2019t have your powers to stand up to the hunters.\n\nEventually you start to hear the sounds of footsteps coming down the stairs. Multiple ones. This is it.\n\nYou wait for the first hunter that turns the corner and put your fist through his chest. However no sooner have you done that when two Joachim zealots blast you with that burning light spell to your face.\n\nDespite being half blind and your face on fire, you kill one of them and a hunter that stabs you in chest (But fortunately missing your heart), but then you hear the other zealot shout some prayer of some kind and you suddenly feel a great sense of terror. Something you haven\u2019t felt since you were human.\n\nPart of you feels the desire to run, while another part of you feels the desire to just quake in fear and freeze.\n\n\u201cYOU CANNOT RESIST THE WILL OF JOACHIM! FEAR HIS BURNING STARE AND DIE UNHOLY CREATURE!\u201d\n\nThis is soon followed up by multiple gunshots to your body and head. Silver burns through your body and you fall to the ground. You have truly never felt so helpless.\n\nYou roll over and attempt to crawl away, but someone hacks at one of your legs and practically severs it. Your cry out in agony.\n\n\u201cChop the vile thing\u2019s head off and be done with it!\u201d someone shouts.\n\u201cHey look behind us.\u201d Someone else says.\n\u201cTilderman? I thought you were dead\u2026wait what\u2019re you doing?\u201d another voice asks.\n\nYou then hear the sound of a metal clank on the floor. Several people shouting \u201cSHIT!\u201d and then a deafening blast.\n\nThe blast probably would have killed you outright had it not been shielded by the hunters closer to it. As it stands you\u2019ve only lost part of your legs (One of which was partially severed anyway) part of your back it literally on fire and you\u2019ve got burns on most of your body.\n\nYou have just enough strength to roll over a couple times to put the flames out, but you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to heal from this. Miraculously your hearing isn\u2019t completely gone and the muffled ringing goes away pretty quickly.\n\nCharred body parts are all over the corridor and the smell of burned flesh and blood is filling the air along with smoke and powder.\n\nYou hear a single set of footsteps approaching, and you certainly hope it isn\u2019t another hunter, because you\u2019re not in much condition to fight right now.\n\nYou then see a figure step through the smoke and by the way they\u2019re dressed and armed with a repeating crossbow, they do indeed look like a hunter, however you see the eyes which are those familiar blank white orbs.\n\n\u201cKayla?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt is I.\u201d she answers.\n\u201cThank the gods\u2026except for that asshole Joachim.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t thank them yet sir.\u201d\n\nKayla points the crossbow at you.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026are you serious?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cVery serious sir. Your usefulness to me is at an end and I\u2019ll never have a better opportunity to kill you. Without any more ghouls around, now I don\u2019t have to worry about them either. The number of villagers is at a manageable number and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be even more pliable now, especially without their ruler eating any more of them. In a few more years, who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll go try to find that Isabella and rekindle our relationship. She seemed much more powerful than you anyway.\u201d\n\nWith those last words, you see Kayla transform into you and then fires multiple silver bolts into your heart.\n\nAs your body seizes up and goes into a paralysis, Kayla takes a saber and finishes you off with a chop to your neck.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Leave", "result": "You know when something looks like a losing battle. This is mostly on you anyway, you let yourself get too much attention with your actions and now you\u2019ve got an army of fanatics on your ass.\n\nYou let your pride get in the way and thought you knew better; well this is what happens. You\u2019re starting to think Isabella was right. You could kick yourself for fucking up your relationship with her now; then again her being right doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t being domineering.\n\nIn any case, you can\u2019t go home again and you probably should just move forward anyway. Maybe you need to go some place new entirely, like the Delantium Kingdom or something.\n\nWithout another word, you go gather what little personal belongings you still regard as important.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving. Not going to stick around for this. Not worth it and I\u2019m sick of the headache anyway.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cBut sir! You can\u2019t just leave all this!\u201d\n\u201cSure I can, watch me.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat, do you want to run this place?

I\u2019ll just get ready to go too.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not coming.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me, you\u2019re not coming and neither are the ghouls. Going it alone again for awhile.\u201d\n\u201cBut what am I supposed to do?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, do whatever you like. You\u2019re released from my servitude, in fact I said you could leave on your own many times before, so you were always free to leave. Ugh, still gotta wait for night fall.\u201d\n\nAs you prepare for a long wait, Kayla begins pacing a bit and then starts trying to convince you to fight, but it\u2019s not working and the more she\u2019s trying to convince you the less patient you get with her.\n\n\u201cKayla, your voice is beginning to anger me. I told you to leave.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI just really believe that you can win against these interlopers. Then after you win, your reputation will be so fearsome, nobody will ever attempt to invade you again.\u201d Kayla says.\n\u201cI seriously doubt that.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you fight sir. I mean you didn\u2019t get all this by just standing back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you seem a little too eager for me to try. Why is that exactly? And don\u2019t tell me how much you believe I can win, because it\u2019s more than that. You seem to just not want me to leave your side given that you were also willing to leave.\u201d\n\nKayla gets a bit quiet and then sputters a bit before gathering her thoughts.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026okay you got me sir. I\u2019m in love with you and I should have just outright admitted it before. I was just embarrassed because\u2026well I know you would never have such feelings for me like that. Apologies sir, I will leave.\u201d\n\nKayla turns to leave.\n\n\u201cHold on wait. Come back over here. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but maybe I\u2019ve been lying to myself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSir?\u201d Kayla asks.\n\u201cMaybe I do have some feelings for you as well Kayla. I just didn\u2019t want to admit it due to everything.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean me being a doppelganger?\u201d\n\u201cWell part of that I suppose, but more because none of my past relationships have ever worked out well. Maybe I\u2019ve let that cause the distance between us as a master and servant, but perhaps we should attempt to become more.\u201d\n\u201cOh sir! Do you really mean it?!\u201d\n\u201cYes. Whatever I ultimately decide to do, we\u2019re going to do it together from now on. Now come to me my love, I want us to finally embrace intimately.\u201d\n\nKayla rushes excitedly to you and puts her arms around you. You look deep into her blank white eyes.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to turn into a more pleasing form sir?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I want to do this to you in your natural form.\u201d\n\nKayla\u2019s normally featureless face displays a wide smile, which might be a little unnerving if you weren\u2019t who you are. She\u2019s very happy. Good. She was a loyal servant for a long time so she earned a happy last moment.\n\nYou then twist Kayla\u2019s head around and tear it off completely. You then toss the head aside as gray goo leaks out of the body.\n\nObviously she was up to something and leaving her alive might have just caused problems for you in the long run. Better to play it cautiously, especially with all the attention you\u2019ve attracted. Last thing you need is someone pretending to be you and you don\u2019t have direct control over it.\n\nYou continue to wait in silence until darkness falls and that\u2019s when you take your leave. You don\u2019t even bother giving your ghouls any last orders or anything like that. You just run off as quickly as possible in the night.\n\nYou still have a distance to travel and you don\u2019t really know how you\u2019ll fair in the Delantium Kingdom, but it can\u2019t be too much worse than what you\u2019ve already been through.

I\u2019ve tasted greenskins better than you!\u201d you say spitting out most of the gray stuff.\n\nThe dop attempts to get away after your temporary distraction, but it\u2019s a futile endeavor, you catch it and ignore its last pleas for mercy before breaking its neck. You aren\u2019t actually sure if that\u2019s going to kill it, so you decapitate it just to be sure.\n\nYou leave the house and find that a minor crowd has gathered from a safe distance. They\u2019re probably wondering what exactly happened, time to make up a story.\n\n\u201cIs that\u2026thing gone m\u2019lord?\u201d someone asks.\n\u201cYes, of course it is. Didn\u2019t you hear its death scream? I interrogated it first though. Apparently those bandits I thought I took care of have regrouped and will be trying to attack again. However, we know the truth now and can prepare. I\u2019m going to track them down and finish them off for good, however I\u2019m still going to bless some of you and when I do, you will be charged with helping the defense of this village. I trust you all will be up for the challenge should it come to that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course m\u2019lord! We all will!\u201d\n\u201cThen we will start tomorrow, for now though I wish to spend time alone.\u201d\n\nYou spend the rest of the night wondering if you should just go ahead and attack tomorrow night or wait around to turn some of the villagers into ghouls so you have help. As much as you hate to waste time to let them get better equipped, you decide if the mines are as trapped and treacherous as the dop claimed they were, it probably would be to go in with help, if only to use as fodder.\n\nThe next night you start again with what you originally planned. This time you pick a married couple at random and decide to see how it goes. You give them both some of your blood which causes them to gag a bit and then generally feel \u201cweird.\u201d\n\nThe pair of them stagger back home. You then repeat this process with five more villagers before you need to stop as it\u2019s a drain on your own strength.\n\nA couple days and nights pass and you repeat the process with all of them and just when you\u2019re starting to get frustrated, they start to show a change. The seven of them become more fawning than usual towards you and you don\u2019t even have to do anything. They\u2019re also paler and beginning to move in a less normal fashion. It\u2019s more of a loping gait. Their appetite becomes a lot less normal as well.\n\nYou think you\u2019ve finally changed them into ghouls. You\u2019re glad it didn\u2019t take as long as Isabella once suggested it would if you attempted it.\n\nHowever, you soon discover all her warnings were correct. First off, they ARE very annoying with how much they\u2019re underfoot all the time. Still, they are very obedient and they soon finish digging out the area meant to be your new resting place under the house. It\u2019s crude, but you figure it can be worked on continually. For now though it\u2019s functional enough that you don\u2019t need to sleep in a hole in the ground in the forest nearby.\n\nKeeping them subdued when you\u2019re asleep is another matter however. While you attempt to tell them to stand guard over you, they\u2019re little like children in that they get bored and have short attention spans.\n\nWhile they haven\u2019t actually attacked anyone yet, they\u2019re acting aggressive enough that it won\u2019t be long. This naturally causes some of the other villagers to be wary and now that\u2019s potentially messing up your relationship with them.\n\nTo counter act this, you give a few intimidating speeches, re-hyponotize a few of the key villagers again and have a few of the more aggressive ghouls whipped before the mob and scold them for their behavior. The pathetic creatures soon learn that they aren\u2019t going to be chewing on their neighbors anytime soon. Still, it does make other villagers less eager to want to become ghouls now, though you\u2019re sort of wondering if it\u2019s worth it since it\u2019s taking your strength to upkeep all the ghouls which is in turn taking more of a toll on your villagers anyway.\n\nWhile you\u2019re trying to keep a precarious balance of humans and non-humans together through your powers and plain old fear, you also keep in mind that it will soon be time to meet up with Green Eye and his crew. You just hope you\u2019ll have the element of surprise to a point where it won\u2019t matter how many silver weapons they have.\n\nWhen the night finally comes, you head to Green Eye\u2019s mine with your ghouls who happily follow.\n\nWhen you arrive, the lone hobgoblin guard stands there at the entrance with the child tribute. You can already sense the rise in the savage\u2019s heartbeat when he sees you arrive with your ghouls. The child of course is already scared.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026we have your tribute as usual.\u201d The hobgoblin says.\n\u201cYeah, about that. Don\u2019t really need the kids anymore. There\u2019s been a change in recent developments.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, in fact I\u2019ve decided to make the whole tribute process simpler by getting rid of you all\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the hobgoblin to process what you mean exactly. His eyes widen and he turns to run, but you catch him before he gets anywhere and break his neck.\n\nYou turn to address your ghouls who are already in the process of advancing. The boy who is tribute is frozen in fear.\n\n\u201cHold on, wait\u2026ah damn it! Fatty! Fuck, I was going to tell you lot to leave the boy alone so he could tell the tale to his village of how I saved him from the bandit scum. Never mind now I guess.\u201d\n\nYou smack your ghouls around to get them to stop feeding on the boy and the hobgoblin so you can get the rest of this task finished.\n\nYou once again enter the mine and once again you come to the large open area where most of Green Eye\u2019s people are gathered. No sign of Green Eye, but in the meantime, you\u2019ll be wiping out the rest of his people.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long for your ghouls to start howling and leaping into battle with abandon. You don\u2019t bother reining them in. Green Eye\u2019s people are for the most part unprepared, but there is some resistance. With the silver weapons, they probably would do a lot better than last time against you, but since you brought a bunch of ghouls, they do about as well as last time.\n\nThe battle in the main cavern is quick and bloody, several of your ghouls go chasing people down in various tunnels. The rest of them start feasting on the dead already in the immediate area.\n\nWhile you hear sounds of fighting and screaming coming from various tunnels, you still have not seen Green Eye; it would appear your hunt for him is going to begin right now.\n\nSince you\u2019ve already been warned about the place being trapped, you figure it probably would be a good thing if you took some of your ghouls directly with you. Of course it might be a good idea to leave most of them here to guard this area just in case Green Eye tries to escape this way when you\u2019re looking for him.\n\nYou decide you can probably afford to take two and leave the remaining two here. The other three that went running off will probably wander back here eventually.\n\nYou then give your orders and you pick the tunnel that you remember seeing Green Eye walk from the last time you were here.\n\nYou cautiously walk around even keeping the ghouls slightly back, since while they are expendable, you don\u2019t want to just lose them unless you have to. So far though, and you aren\u2019t coming across anything out of the ordinary. This is good in that there aren\u2019t any dangers that have been nearly killing you, but bad in that you haven\u2019t uncovered any secret passage ways or rooms that Green Eye might be hiding in.\n\nEventually you stop hearing any noise of combat. Either your ghouls killed everyone or you\u2019re getting far enough a way from you original location.\n\nLater, you\u2019ve already gone down several dead ends and while you\u2019re not lost, you are getting frustrated since there doesn\u2019t seem to be any clue of where Green Eye is. You start to curse yourself in that it might have been a good idea to try to leave one of his people alive to point you in the right direction. Even leaving the dop alive and dragging it with you, would have helped.\n\nYou start to get paranoid that maybe Green Eye has doubled back somehow and managed to escape so you start heading back to the large cavern near the entrance.\n\nThe problem is you do it so fast that you aren\u2019t as cautious this time, and while you passed through several tunnels that weren\u2019t trapped, you don\u2019t take into consideration that Green Eye didn\u2019t sneak around and trap them after you already passed through.\n\nEven then, you might have been quick enough or had the danger sense to avoid something amiss, but your ghouls are another matter.\n\nNo sooner have you heard the \u201cSpong!\u201d noise that you quickly look to where you need to take cover.\n\nA huge rumble occurs in front of you and before your eyes you see both of your ghouls gets crushed by a cave in by an explosion. You are actually blown back a bit and quickly scramble up when you also see that this isn\u2019t just a cave in, but a cascading effect.\n\nYou have no choice but to run back deeper into the mines, though you\u2019re so busy trying to get away, you end up taking a tunnel you haven\u2019t explored.\n\nYou run down the unexplored tunnel trying to avoid getting buried and hoping you outrun it or find an exit of some sort.\n\nYou find an exit, but it\u2019s down.\n\nOnce again, not paying attention, you fall down a pit. You attempt to grab on to the sides of the smooth wall, but you only succeed in ripping your fingernails off in the process and it disappears eventually anyway as you fall into a larger underground cavern and slam hard into the rocky ground below. Your yells of pain echo throughout the cavern.\n\nYou\u2019ve most definitely broken several bones in your legs. You\u2019ll regenerate, but it\u2019s going to be slow, especially without any fresh blood around, unless there are some rats around.\n\nAs you start to look for something like that, you feel more rumbling. At first you think it\u2019s ceiling collapsing on you here, but then you realize the sound is coming from below.\n\nThis silver mine closing down wasn\u2019t due to it running dry, it was more because there was an infestation of giant insect things in the lower parts of it, which you have now discovered.\n\nThe chittering becomes louder and eventually several many legged, many eyed things burst forth from the ground.\n\nYou fight about as best as you can in your situation, but you\u2019re weak, crippled and overwhelmed.\n\nYou die screaming in the darkness as you are devoured.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Leave them human", "result": "You\u2019re not rewarding these people any more than you have to. These mortals are just going to have to work harder.\n\nThe rest of the month passes and fortunately they seem to be making better progress with the project, should be done by next month at least.\n\nBefore that happens you go over to Green Eye\u2019s mine to pick up your tribute. There\u2019s a single hobgoblin guard at the entrance with a girl looking down the entire time.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the new tribute. Green Eye says he hopes she is suitable and assures you that she has not been touched by anyone here.\u201d The hobgoblin remarks.\n\nYou look at the peasant girl who is obviously frightened out of her mind, but too terrified to run or do anything.\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d You command and lift her chin up so she looks into your eyes. You say a few commanding words to her and soon she loses all will of her own. She then walks away from Green Eye and holds you tightly.\n\n\u201cShit, wish I had that ability. It would make a whole of things much easier with the missus.\u201d The hobgoblin remarks.\n\u201cTell Green Eye, the tribute was suitable.\u201d You say and then leave with your tribute to head back home.\n\nThe third month rolls around and at last your humans have finished your home. You inspect it and find nothing out of place. It looks like it was reinforced with several pillars and they even tried their best to make it look \u201chomey.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like it m\u2019lord? We tried to make sure that everything would be comfortable for you and later we can expand on it if you wish.\u201d Vic asks in his usual toadying manner.\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s fine, and get back! You are entirely too fucking close!\u201d you shout, slapping him.\n\nHonestly it\u2019s a far cry from Isabella\u2019s crypt, but it\u2019s better than sleeping in a dug out hole in the ground in the forest. You\u2019re in a mildly jovial mood so you decide to celebrate by spending the night in it not doing much of anything except feeding on and fucking a couple of the village girls. There are no objections obviously.\n\nNight passes into day and while you\u2019re fast asleep, you\u2019re suddenly awakened by the noise above you. At first you think it\u2019s just the villagers being noisy, but by the sounds of yelling and screaming, something else is going on.\n\n\u201cShit...\u201d you say to yourself already knowing what might be going on.\n\nSince you drank one of the girls dry last night, you tell the remaining living one to go take a quick peek at what\u2019s going on. She does so and as soon as she pops her head up from the trapdoor, a gun blast is heard and her body drops from the top of the ladder and on the floor in front of you. Most of her face is blown off.\n\n\u201cYubin, you bleedin\u2019 idjit! Ya supposed ta shoot da pale man! Quick! Reload! Reload!\u201d you hear an orc shout.\n\nThose backstabbing\u2026they are going to rue this day\u2026\n\nYou quickly make your way up the ladder and find yourself facing several of Green Eye\u2019s boys.\n\n\u201cShit! Daggers!\u201d the closest orc shouts.\n\nYou make quick work of the orc shouting orders and then the one immediately next to him. Several of the humans and halfbreeds attempt to stab you next, and the last one of them just manages to sink his blade into your shoulder before you break his neck.\n\nThe pain is more than you expected it to be. It doesn\u2019t just feel like a sharp pain, but more like a hot burning sensation all throughout your shoulder and top part of your arm.\n\nYou pull it out and see why. The blade is silver.\n\n\u201cSonof\u2026Argh!\u201d you utter when you feel a blast of gunshot in your back from Yubin who was busily reloading his musket just outside the doorway to the house. The silver in the shot is enough to drop you.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dead yet! Shoot him! Shoot him again!\u201d you hear Vic shout.\n\u201cI can\u2019t! I\u2019m outta da stuff! I\u2019m gettin\u2019 outta here!\u201d Yubin\u2019s remarks and then runs off.\n\u201cShit. HEY! Get Big Tooth over here, we need his help! It\u2019s the man who killed his brother anyway!\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe Vic is working with Green Eye\u2019s bandits. When did this happen? Was this always the case? Was it the long con? Did he have some secret meeting recently?\n\nIn any case it doesn\u2019t matter. Vic and several of the bandits have already returned to the house. One of the bandits, Big Tooth is an ogre. Vic orders him to drag your ass out of the house while the others attempt to help. Normally, you\u2019d be strong enough to resist, but you\u2019re partially paralyzed from the silver shot lodged in your spine and it isn\u2019t healing anytime soon.\n\nBig Tooth drags you by both legs and while you struggle, even taking down one of the bandits along the way; it doesn\u2019t take long before Big Tooth\u2019s strength (which is also enhanced due to his anger that you killed his brother last year) manages to get you to the doorway and that\u2019s when you start feel the burn of the sun.\n\nYou snarl and try to hang on to anything so as to not get dragged all the way out, but the other bandits start hacking at your hands with their silver daggers causing you to eventually lose your grip after losing several fingers.\n\nBig Tooth gives one more pull and you are at last fully exposed to the sun. You roll around screaming in agony as your skin begins to burn.\n\nAll around you the village isn\u2019t doing too much better, what with some of it being in flames and all. Green Eye\u2019s men are finally finishing the job you prevented them from doing last year.\n\nYour last thoughts are of how Isabella was right about this not ending well, just before Big Tooth stomps your burning skull into nothing but bloody brains and bone fragments.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Just kill them all and be done with it", "result": "As much as the idea of ruling over this miserable lot like a king appeals to you on some level, the fact is you don\u2019t really want to be bothered micromanaging. You imagine it\u2019s why Isabella doesn\u2019t bother directly controlling Dert. It\u2019s much simpler for her to just let them live their own lives and only intervene when absolutely necessary.\n\nWould have been nice to have killed the bandits before they fucked up the village, since then the peasants wouldn\u2019t have known about you. Now that they do, you can\u2019t very well just let them live. One of them would surely blab at one of the other villages and the whole point of this, was to lay low in the first place.\n\n\u201cRise.\u201d You tell the man groveling before you.\n\nHe does so slowly before you.\n\n\u201cYour terms\u2026\u201d you start to say.\n\u201cYes?\u201d he asks with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.\n\nYou grab him by the throat and break his neck with ease. The light goes out of his eyes and he slumps to the ground.\n\n\u201cAre not acceptable.\u201d You add.\n\nThe rest of the peasants are paralyzed with fear or crying. Most of the crying comes from the children though. This gives you an idea.\n\n\u201cListen up sheep! Do not attempt to escape, I guarantee you will not make it. I\u2019m fast and strong enough to kill and catch everyone here! Your lives are forfeit this night. If I had not come here, the bandits would have finished you off. You have nobody to blame but yourselves for being so weak. However, I have a counter proposal to make this necessary deed at least somewhat less horrific.\u201d\n\nYou stare at the peasants for a bit, making sure you\u2019ve got their full attention, though they really aren\u2019t going anywhere at this point. Actually you aren\u2019t sure if they ALL decided to run and scatter if you actually would be able to catch and kill all of them, but so far they\u2019re so scared they believe anything you say.\n\n\u201cProvide no resistance, and I will make your deaths quick. Also, some of you have children. I will spare the children and take them away from here so they won\u2019t be defenseless against the bandits or the surrounding wilderness. This is the best offer you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know you\u2019re telling the truth and that you\u2019ll not harm the children?\u201d one asks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. But think of it this way, resist me and I\u2019ll make sure the children die FIRST before your eyes. Comply and at worst you can die wondering if I kept my word.\u201d\n\nThat certainly got most of their attention. In typical fashion, most of the parents are more than willing to sacrifice themselves for their children. Even some of the ones who don\u2019t have any are compliant.\n\nAmusingly some beg if you can turn them into a vampire instead. You respond that none of them are worthy of \u201cthe gift.\u201d You of course aren\u2019t going to tell the truth that you can\u2019t make any of them into vampires if you wanted to anyway, since Isabella has explained that you have to be much older than you currently are before you could even attempt it. You might be able to make them into ghouls at best, but from what Isabella has told you about ghouls, you\u2019d rather not have such disgusting creatures fawning all over you all the time either.\n\nParents attempt to calm their children, but it\u2019s a lost cause, most of them are too upset. You push the parents aside and have them group the children together. You speak in a calming voice to them all. It\u2019s hard to focus on all of them like this, but fortunately children seem to be more susceptible to vampiric suggestion.\n\nSoon, the children are in a dazed like condition.\n\n\u201cSee? Now they won\u2019t even experience the horror of watching me kill you all. Shall we begin?\u201d\n\nWithout another word, you unleash terrible violence upon the peasants. Despite their promise to comply, most of them try to run anyway. Human instinct you suppose. Though it doesn\u2019t matter much since they stupidly don\u2019t scatter very far you easily catch the lot that do run anyway.\n\nOthers do thankfully comply. Some of these are the parents who are tearfully spending their last moments with their children (even if they are currently hypnotized).\n\nAfter you finish off the last mewling mother and drink her dry, you turn your attention to the children who are thankfully still under your suggestion.\n\n\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s go children, we\u2019ve got a lot of ground to cover and unfortunately you lot don\u2019t run as fast as me\u2026hmm. Maybe that cart will do\u2026\u201d\n\nYou load all the children onto an undamaged cart and push it as fast as you can. It\u2019s slower than if you were by yourself, but then its also faster than if they all had to follow you on foot.\n\nDifficulty comes when you reach the forest since you have to start maneuvering between trees, eventually you have to stop, but it\u2019s not too bad since you\u2019re almost at your destination anyway.\n\n\u201cCome on kids, we\u2019re running from here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tedious task of herding these children and having to slow down for them, but eventually you reach your destination. Just in time too since it\u2019s almost dawn. You\u2019re just glad you haven\u2019t attracted any unwanted attention during this whole thing.\n\nYou make your way down the steps and probably due to all the footsteps, Isabella comes to meet you. She looks like she was prepared for a fight too.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?! With all the footsteps I heard, I thought it was some group of hunters or something!\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWell this should make you a bit happier.\u201d You answer and present the children behind you.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this then? Children? Where did you get them from? Not Dert I hope.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not from Dert, not from Holgard either. They\u2019re from a place that actually no longer exists.\u201d\n\u201cDid you finally lose control and wipe out an entire village? So much for laying low.\u201d\n\u201cNo I only wiped out half of one. Bandits already fucked up the place before I even got there. Killed them and the remaining villagers. The only witnesses are these children, which I thoughtfully brought home to you.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Just for me huh?\u201d\n\u201cWell I know you really like child blood and it isn\u2019t like I\u2019m going to have the patience to stretch the little bastards out like you do, so they\u2019re all yours.\u201d\n\nIsabella is very happy with you right now, she embraces you lovingly and gives you a playful bite which you return.\n\n\u201cMmm, I knew I picked you for a reason\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust one request though. Could you keep the kids hypnotized? I mean I know you tend to do that with your food anyway, but uh, I sort of promised that no harm would come to them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What deal is this? I thought you said you didn\u2019t leave anyone alive.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, and I mean officially I\u2019m NOT harming the kids since I\u2019m giving them to you, but\u2026 I dunno\u2026I\u2019d feel a little less like a liar if the kids don\u2019t feel any pain while you drink their blood.\u201d\n\nIsabella smiles a bit at your odd sense of \u201cmorality.\u201d\n\n\u201cAww, that is so adorable. You have a twisted code of honor. Very well, but you didn\u2019t really need to worry about it anyway, last thing I need to hear are children caterwauling throughout my crypt. I know some vampires love to hear their lunch beg and scream and claim it makes the blood taste better. Not me. I prefer my food to just be silent so I can eat in peace. In any case, let me get these lovelies locked up and I\u2019ll be meeting you in the bedroom. I hope you aren\u2019t too tired from your earlier actions, because I suggest you prepare yourself.\u201d\n\nWhether you were tired or not, wouldn\u2019t make any difference to you anyway.\n\nYou make your way to the bedroom thinking that while you might not be a king over some groveling peasants, you\u2019ll certainly be king in here and that\u2019s a whole lot more fun.\n\nWhen Isabella comes to the bedroom, she stands in the doorway just staring at you for a moment. At first you think she\u2019s just taking in all your manliness, but then she beckons you off the bed.\n\n\u201cYou come with me, I got something else in mind. Something special\u2026but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll still get to that.\u201d\n\nYou do so and soon realize that she\u2019s taking you to her garden. She\u2019s NEVER done that.\n\nWhen you enter, the garden is quite sizeable and bathed in a glowing blue light. You always knew there was a light source in there due to the glow you could see whenever Isabella exited it, but now you know it comes from some sort of luminescent fungus that is all over the walls and ceiling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sunlight, but it works well enough. Come walk with me.\u201d Isabella says and takes your hand to enter her garden.\n\nThe garden is unsurprisingly very well cared for. There are all sorts of flowers, though you\u2019ve never been an expert on such matters, but you\u2019re fairly certain there are types of plants here that don\u2019t normally grow in this environment. You weren\u2019t aware there was a small reservoir of water here either, almost like a pond, but then you imagine that would make having a garden here a lot easier with a water source.\n\nIsabella doesn\u2019t say anything and just takes you through the garden. She begins pointing to the various plants and giving small histories of them. She also starts to tell you about her own memories of when she first saw these various plants and flowers.\n\nIt becomes a very intimate history of her life and who she is. It\u2019s actually all very enlightening mainly because even after all these years you STILL didn\u2019t know much about her past.\n\nAll these years you believed her to be some sort of royalty. Perhaps even a princess of some sort of long lost Empire. But no, her beginnings are actually very humble, possibly even more humble than your own.\n\nShe was a simple peasant girl that worked in a flower shop. Then one night she caught the eye of a vampire who was of minor royalty (Though trying very hard to keep it secret from the general public). He revealed his true nature immediately to her, but insisted that he had no intention on hurting her.\n\nIsabella explains that she at first complied with him out of fear, but eventually she didn\u2019t mind spending time with him. She says she doesn\u2019t know if it was because he was working his dark charms on her, or that she was young and foolish, but she said whatever the reason, she did come to love him.\n\nShe says she never really knew why he chose her. She suspects her looks helped initially, but it wasn\u2019t like she was special in that regard. He could have easily had any upper class lady, but then perhaps he knew that marrying one of them would have drawn more attention to himself while marrying a lower class girl might just be grateful for the uplifted standing and if he had to silence her, well who would care?\n\nStill, marrying someone of such lowly birth raised eyebrows anyway. Didn\u2019t take long before everything started to fall apart and those that would seek to harm him started focusing on various eccentricities, oddities and other things that caused people to start to wonder.\n\nFor a time, Isabella mostly stayed on his castle grounds spending much of her time in the gardens. She said it was the only place that put her at ease since she knew even with as much power as her husband had, there would be no way he could fight all the forces gathering against him.\n\nOf course he wouldn\u2019t leave either. He would fight and die. Isabella was prepared to die with him, but he realized that none of this would be her concern if he hadn\u2019t dragged her into this life in the first place.\n\nSo he did the only thing he could think of to save her, he gave her the gift of immortality and told her to live her life as she saw fit. She didn\u2019t want to leave at first, but he insisted and perhaps to some degree Isabella did love her own life more than him.\n\nIsabella left in the middle of the night, just before the siege of his castle started. A few months later she had heard that he had died and they had a priest of Joachim dowse his burnt corpse in holy water after removing his head.\n\nIsabella goes on about a few other bits of her life, but her origins are what are most fascinating. Makes you wonder why now all of a sudden she\u2019s decided to tell you.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m finally comfortable with you. Sure, you mess up every now and then, but ultimately you listen and do something special for me. I know living with me hasn\u2019t been easy because you probably were always wondering where exactly you stood with me. Well tonight I revealed my soul to you\u2026so to speak. You must understand that this was very difficult for me. I\u2019ve tried this before, and it\u2019s never ended well.\u201d Isabella says.\n\u201cWell, I guess you have probably had a very eventful past.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYou only know a minor bit of it, but enough about the past, I want to embrace the future. Embrace me here in the garden, in the soil and amongst the plants. Maybe we\u2019re dead, but I want to make love with life surrounding us.\u201d\n\nRather poetic. You can\u2019t say all this doesn\u2019t emotionally move you somewhat.\n\nYou and Isabella proceed to be intimate in the garden and it\u2019s definitely the most positive experience you\u2019ve ever had.\n\nYou might have thought in the past that you were in love before, but now you truly know it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes..", "result": "Year 34\u2026\n\nThe more Holgard changes the more it stays the same.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing everyone has such short memories here. Then again, hard for anyone to worry about vampires when nobody actually found you. Most of the real hunters have moved on. There\u2019s still the Joachimites, but they\u2019re more likely to go burn a poor old woman as a witch before they actually go hunting for a vampire. Lot easier for one thing.\n\nNowadays Holgard is back to being under the plain old paranoia it normally suffers from. You\u2019ve heard rumors of that the Delantium Kingdom is going to try to reclaim this city, but that\u2019s about the only major thing and it\u2019s not likely true anyway.\n\nStill, laying low in the backwoods and only coming here occasionally was a good idea. Of course you tend to spend more time with Isabella now since the two of you are a proper couple now. You find stories about her old life fascinating (Though you tend to want her to gloss over any bits about ex-lovers) though you know who would really find them interesting, your sister. You bet she could make an entire opera or something out of Isabella\u2019s life. Probably a couple of them.\n\nYou\u2019ve sort of been thinking about your family lately and how they might all be doing. You assume that they\u2019re all still alive of course. You sort of miss them all as strange as that may seem given what you\u2019ve done and what you are now. Your last shred of humanity you suppose.\n\nRegardless, you\u2019d never be able to visit them even if you weren\u2019t wanted for murder in your hometown. Or rather, you could go back because nobody could stop you or you could be stealthy about it, but you don\u2019t think you should. It\u2019s a closed chapter in your old life and going back in person would just cause more problems.\n\nStill, you wonder if you shouldn\u2019t get a message to your mother. You\u2019re sure she\u2019d at least like to know if you were doing okay. You\u2019d send one to your sister, but who knows where she is.\n\nMaybe you could write a letter and send it off via one of those courier services. You suppose you better put a quill, ink and parchment on the list of shit you need to get along with the items Isabella sent you to get at the flower nursery here.\n\nFunny that after everything that\u2019s occurred in your \u201clife\u201d you still have to do a little roguery the occasional store every once in awhile. You guess the more you change the more you stay the same as well.\n\nYou of course find it much simpler now. It also no longer gives you the rush that it once did, but then that\u2019s no surprise, you\u2019ve come a long way since those simple rogue days.\n\nYou head to the nursery and easily break in like you\u2019ve done many times before. You imagine the old couple that run this place wonder where they\u2019ve misplaced their various seeds, supplies and such on many occasions.\n\nAfter grabbing the things Isabella sent you to get, you start rummaging through the small office there to find potential writing supplies, then you suddenly sense something living nearby and it\u2019s not the plants.\n\nAt first you wonder if it\u2019s one of the old couple that runs this place because if it is, you\u2019ll just stealthily sneak out as you\u2019ve done before. (No point in killing a business owner of where you do most of your \u201cshopping\u201d)\n\nHowever, you can see that this figure is not carrying a lantern of any sort and is actively trying to stay hidden in the darkness. The form is definitely female and they haven\u2019t noticed that YOU\u2019VE noticed them yet.\n\nThis person is obviously following you and while it would be a simple matter of just killing her, you\u2019d like to know why first.\n\nYou maneuver around behind furniture and aisles a bit and then just when you get behind this person, they turn around and attempt to dodge you. Quick, but not quick enough to avoid your grasp. You easily disarm them and finally get a good look.\n\nThe face is older, but you\u2019d still be able to recognize it anywhere. You\u2019re still taken aback though.\n\n\u201cLisa?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLong time no see.\u201d Lisa says unruffled.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI might ask you the same. Even when you weren\u2019t a vampire you weren\u2019t exactly stealing flowers.\u201d\n\u201cLong story, but I\u2019ve questions of my own. Like why you were following me. However, I\u2019d rather continue this discussion elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cSure, but are you going to let me go first? Your grip is like fucking iron and it\u2019s obvious that if I wished you any harm, I\u2019m far outclassed.\u201d\n\nYou remember a similar situation like this with another \u201cex\u201d however that was a little different. You didn\u2019t really have a proper relationship with Heather like you did with Lisa and also that was when you were a bit of a \u201cwilder\u201d vampire. You\u2019ve started having a little more restraint since those earlier years.\n\nYou release Lisa who heads outside and you follow her out before relocking the door.\n\n\u201cYou re-secure the places you break into now?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cNot usually, but this place is a bit different. Alright, let\u2019s get in that alley and you can tell me everything.\u201d You say and start motioning Lisa to follow.\n\u201cAn alley? I thought we\u2019d go to a tavern at least if we\u2019re going to catch up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really mingle with the crowds unless I have to anymore. Besides, I actually feel safer in an alley than a tavern given how many eyes are in those places.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable, I guess it makes sense for you to lay low given that there\u2019s a price on your head.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I figured you knew that already. I mean it\u2019s not on your head personally; it\u2019s just on the Vampire of Holgard. I was very surprised when I found out that might be you.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?! I thought all that shit had been forgotten about and you\u2019re a hunter?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m an Ebony Claw assassin. Maybe the general public forgets shit when it dies down, but the ECS NEVER forgets.\u201d\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t even been targeting ECS members.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been getting that impression, but so far you\u2019re the only vampire I\u2019ve been able to track in this city.\u201d\n\nThis is nuts. Lisa is an Ebony Claw assassin. You always wondered if she joined while you were away, but she took a very different path than you thought. You guess she learned how to take care of herself all too well. Strange to think that she was once just a simple peasant girl that longed to see the world. But then Isabella was once a simple peasant girl at one time too.\n\nAnd the fact you\u2019re finding out you have a contract on your head is even more of a shocker. Though you suppose that you may have very well killed some of their members during the religious faction war, but you haven\u2019t been killing any of them recently, at least not that you know of.\n\nIs someone setting you up?\n\n\u201cWait, how long have you followed me and how the hell did I not know it before?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, well I AM a very skilled assassin and I kept my distance for a long time. In fact it wasn\u2019t until I figured out it was you that I decided to get close like I did. Had you been any other vampire, I would have been executing you from afar. No way I\u2019d really want to tangle with a real one up close no matter how good I am. As far as how long I\u2019ve tracked you, well I\u2019ve noticed you come here over the course of a few months now. I know you must have a lair somewhere nearby but it\u2019s probably not actually in the city. In any case since I\u2019m fairly certain it isn\u2019t you, I can only imagine it might be another one. Someone you know?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that, I only know one other and she\u2019s a bit\u2026reclusive. Look are you even sure if it\u2019s a vampire?\u201d\n\u201cWell from all the information I\u2019ve been given the ECS leadership here seems to believe it to be the case. Hmmm, maybe a new approach is in order. I think you should come with me so we can straighten this all out.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you seriously expect me to go walking into an ECS hangout? You just told me I got a contract on my head!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to tell me you\u2019re worried? Judging by your skills, you\u2019d be able to wipe out everyone there. Honestly, the Holgard branch of ECS is hardly anything for you to worry about, that why they got me from the Delantium Kingdom. I\u2019m just suggesting though that maybe it still might be a good idea to clear this all up directly. I mean after all I\u2019m not the only assassin and as good as I am, I\u2019m nothing compared to a Fel touched shadow blade assassin. Now someone like that might actually give you problems. They\u2019re also less likely to bother getting down to the truth and just carry out a hit. Better to clear things like this up, trust me. The ECS is not an organization you want on your ass.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re sure Lisa has a point, you really aren\u2019t sure about all this.\n\n\u201cLook, I know this is pretty strange for you seeing me like this under these circumstances. I know it\u2019s been a long time and we\u2019ve both moved on in very different life directions, but I still remember the good times we had. So for old times sake, will you trust me on this?\u201d\n\nYou look at Lisa and despite the fact that the years have taken their toll on her and cynicism has taken root in her demeanor, that last bit she said reminded you of the young girl you once were very fond of. Once again some things remain the same.\n\n\u201cVery well, since this is you, I\u2019ll go, but as soon as I sense I\u2019m going to get attacked, I\u2019m killing everyone there. I mean if I\u2019m already on a contract list, I might as well give them a reason at this point.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have anything to worry about. Mantis is the current ECS leader here. He\u2019s a sonofabitch, but he\u2019s pretty reasonable.\u201d\n\u201cMantis\u2026that name sounds familiar. I think I spoke to him once when I tried to ask the ECS for help with an affliction I had.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You tried to cure your vampire condition?\u201d\n\u201cUh, no. This actually was a different condition I had due to Ral on top of being geased. The vampirism ended up curing me of it actually\u2026yeah things got a bit complicated for a while after we parted ways. In any case, I don\u2019t remember him being that high up or all that reasonable.\u201d\n\u201cWell the original old leader, Rook moved on to bigger things and well, the ECS tends to have enthusiastic violent promotions so to speak and eventually Mantis made his way through the ranks. Still with all the extra responsibility he\u2019s learned to be a little more patient I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t we all\u2026\u201d\n\nYou and Lisa make your way to Mantis\u2019s hang out which apparently is still the Poisoned Blade Inn. She mentions he prefers to stay at the \u201chub\u201d of things\n\nAlong the way, Lisa asks why you never met her again since she waited a long time for you; you explain Ral\u2019s experiment and what happened exactly to you. Lisa listens intently and offers her sympathies.\n\nShe says that during that time you were out of action she had to deal with the Holgard civil war. She mentions this was when she joined the ECS. She said after it was all over, the ECS transferred her to the Delantium Kingdom and there is where she learned to be an assassin.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019ve been in the Delantium Kingdom all this time huh? Guess that\u2019s why I never ran into you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou looked for me?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cInitially I did, but as I said, I eventually figured you moved on or were dead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want me anyway by that point.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026I dunno. I was falling in love with you even when you were forced to work for Ral. I\u2019m certain I might have been able to look past what you are now. It isn\u2019t like I\u2019m in any position to judge you morally after all. Well looks like we\u2019re getting close to it.\u201d\n\nBefore you can reply, you sense several figures lurking nearby.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some balls showing up here!\u201d a voice shouts and before you know it a person literally materializes in front of you and Lisa.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to catch you a bit off guard, but you react quick enough to attack your assailant, though apparently not enough to land a hit. This person cannot possibly be a normal human. You wonder if this is one of those Fel touched Lisa mentioned.\n\nYou then hear a shot of a pistol, followed by a burning sensation in your upper back. You collapse to the ground on one knee in pain and feel like part of you is on fire.\n\nGood thing you aren\u2019t human. However, Lisa\u2019s the only one behind you, and it\u2019s obvious that she just shot you in the back. You aren\u2019t sure if it was an accident or if she\u2019s just lead you into a trap.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accident", "result": "Considering that Lisa is supposed to be a well trained assassin that knew what you were before you even met her, seems like if she was going to do any real damage, she would have at least loaded her pistol with silver shot or something similar.\n\nYou\u2019re going to chalk it up to an accident for now, besides you\u2019ve already got someone right in front of you trying to kill you.\n\nYour attacker in front of you attempts to stab you in the face while you\u2019re still hurt, but you dodge, grab his wrist and make him stab himself in the stomach while breaking his arm at the same time.\n\nStanding up again, you sense another person nearby and sure enough they once again appear right in front of you.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d you hear Lisa shout and you hear several more shots fired off. Seems like Lisa has herself one of those fancy repeating pistols.\n\nThis time however you avoid getting hit, but dodging to the right while your attacker is hit twice in the chest.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you hear Lisa shout and another Fel assassin materializes in front of her. She\u2019s not quick enough and you see her fall to the ground when the assassin shoots her with crossbow.\n\nYou\u2019re about to run over to help, but another assassin with a shock of white hair appears and throws a lit firebomb in Lisa\u2019s direction before running off.\n\nYou jump to catch it and throw it to the left, and it ends up going right through a window of the Poisoned Blade Inn.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026so much for diplomacy\u2026\u201d you say and run back to avoid the upcoming blast. Lisa is currently struggling with her attacker, but by the time you get the both of them, the bomb finally goes off.\n\nThe impact of the blast knocks you down and the three of you are rolling on the ground on top of one another. At some point in the chaos you feel a blade in your ribs from the person who is on your back. Since this person isn\u2019t very heavy and you can feel the tits on your back, you\u2019re assuming this person is a woman.\n\nFor Lisa\u2019s sake, you hope that this is a female EC assassin\u2026\n\nYou smash your head as hard as you can backwards into the assassin\u2019s face. It\u2019s enough for her to lose her grip. You notice that he other figure crawling from underneath you is indeed Lisa, so happily you know she didn\u2019t just accidently wound you again.\n\nThe female assassin tries blink away or whatever it is they do, but you catch her arm just as she turns herself invisible. Well not invisible to you though. You pull the blade out that she shoved in your rib and shove it into her ear, then you drop her.\n\nWhile all this is going on, a few EC members have been running out of their now fiery hang out screaming and burning. Lisa is leaning up against a nearby wall looking down at the bolt in her thigh.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cWell after you shot me in the back, it all became pretty chaotic.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that\u2026shit\u2026I need to take this\u2026\u201d Lisa says and takes out a vial of something and swallows the contents, and then pulls out the bolt.\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, come on, we gotta get that bastard\u2026the Watch is probably coming anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what bastard?\u201d\n\u201cMantis, of course. He probably got away through a trapdoor to the sewers, come on there should be a sewer entrance around here. Maybe we can still track him.\u201d\n\nLisa starts limping away as fast as she can, but stumbles.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026that poisoned bolt is still fucking me up\u2026I\u2019ll be alright. I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Here.\u201d You say and just pick Lisa up over your shoulder and get out of the immediate area before you have to massacre the Holgard Watch.\n\nAfter ducking into alley a couple blocks away from the chaos, you finally put Lisa down who is looking slightly better. While you don\u2019t think she set you up, given all that\u2019s happened you are getting the impression that Lisa has not told you everything.\n\n\u201cAlright Lisa, out courtesy for what we once had, you got ONE chance to explain yourself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOr what\u2026(ugh) you gonna drink me dry?\u201d Lisa says wincing at the pain of her wound and unconcerned about your tone.\n\nYou pick Lisa up by her shoulders and your more monstrous threatening face becomes visible. She tries her best to not look scared, but you can sense the fear.\n\n\u201cYou need to drop the tough girl act, right now. Because I\u2019ve done a hell of a lot worse than kill an old girlfriend since the last time you saw me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah? Well maybe you\u2019d be doing me a favor if you did. At least it would be you then.\u201d\n\nYou can see the desperation now in her eyes and it\u2019s enough to calm you down.\n\nWell you guess not all of the \u201chuman\u201d has left you.\n\n\u201cLisa, just tell me what the hell is going on already, because I\u2019m getting the impression that I\u2019m not the one that needs to worry about a contract on my head.\u201d You say.\n\nLisa keeps it together and tells you the story.\n\nThe contract is actually on her head, specifically Mantis put it on her a few years ago, or at least set it up. She mentions he\u2019s been a thorn in her side shortly after she joined the ECS. At first he would constantly hit on her when she was stationed in Holgard.\n\nThen when she got transferred to the Delantium Kingdom to become a better trained assassin, she thought she was done with him, but eventually he was also in the DK for awhile making upwardly mobile moves of his own. For whatever reason he continued to harass her and trying to make things harder for her.\n\nHe eventually returned to Holgard when another member, Rook, was promoted. Mantis took over the ECS in this city and now had direct ties to Fel Temple as well. With all this extra influence and power, he set things in motion to set her up on some job that resulted in the death of another high ranking ECS member.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s been on the ECS hit list. She knows it was Mantis though that was behind it all and she fully intends on killing him.\n\nYou take all this in and ask one question.\n\n\u201cOkay, so where did I come in on all this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Not initially anyway. You might have missed me, but I actually was in Dert for a brief period of time. I was sort of hiding, pondering my next move, along with making peace with my father since I didn\u2019t exactly leave that village on good terms. It\u2019s funny; when I got there I actually missed how boring it all was. At least I didn\u2019t have a crime syndicate trying to kill me when I lived there. Didn\u2019t know there was a vampire living in the graveyard nearby though.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you saw me? I\u2019m usually so careful.\u201d\n\u201cYou were careful, but you\u2019re also probably used to the people in Dert not wandering near there at night. I was actually there lost in thought about my own situation and that\u2019s when I saw someone skulking out one of the tombs. It was actually a little unnerving since while I\u2019ve experienced some out of the ordinary shit in my life, undead was not one of them. I couldn\u2019t quite make out your face at first, but for a very brief moment I saw it in moonlight and the resemblance was unmistakable. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean I thought you were dead, but not like this!\u201d\n\nLisa holds on to her side and pauses for a moment before continuing.\n\n\u201cSo I followed you since you seemed to have purpose about what you were doing. You\u2019re very quick of course so I probably caught up to you in Holgard just as you were getting ready to leave it. From there I got a good look at you and knew there was no mistaking who you were.\u201d\n\u201cSo wait, why didn\u2019t you contact me then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I saw you bite some hooker and drink her dry, that\u2019s why! I sort of figured that it might not be the best idea to confront you. I didn\u2019t even follow you back to the Dert cemetery, I just stayed in Holgard since I figured I needed to get on with my revenge. That was a couple months ago.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like you should have gotten on with it before now.\u201d\n\u201cWell I still had to do some reconnaissance. Get myself prepared and all that other shit.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like it would be very dangerous being here in the manticore\u2019s den and all.\u201d\n\u201cActually it seemed like it was easier. Mantis may have security up the ass, but he tends to keep it all around himself. Sort of makes other parts of the city under less watch by his people.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but still seems like something you\u2019d want to do quick and get the hell out as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, there was no easy way to do it. If I tried what we just did, I would have gotten cut down easily and Mantis himself is a Fel worshipper or at least he pays enough lip service that he has powers of his own. He\u2019s never alone either in the rare moments he leaves his place. I couldn\u2019t reliably ask for any help on this, but then I randomly noticed you enter the city again. So I followed you again and every other time you came here since despite how stealthy you are, you tend to follow a routine. Always saw you go into that plant nursery and tonight\u2026well I thought I\u2019d risk getting your help.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, but why didn\u2019t you just tell me that? Why all the subterfuge?\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t sure if it was going to work at all first. Second, I got the impression that maybe you\u2019d be more willing to help if YOU were in trouble rather than me. Third, I\u2019ve relied on subterfuge so much in life now, that it just comes naturally.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I understand, but this really would have been easier had you just told me. I mean I would have helped if you had just asked flat out.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? Even though you have a special vampire lady in your life?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know I have a special vampire lady?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned you only knew one other vampire and that SHE was reclusive. I\u2019m willing to bet she\u2019s the one that also made you. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an interesting story.\u201d\n\u201cIt is. She really helped me out and in time it became more.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not looking for a rekindling or anything, but is it possible that you could\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026no. I mean trust me, I would if I could since I think it would make shit a whole lot easier for you, but yeah, I can\u2019t transform anyone into a vampire. Not old enough yet. Best I can do is ghoul and trust me, you definitely don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Well figured I'd ask, shit\u2026I\u2019ve spent so much time resting, Mantis is probably long gone by now.\u201d\n\u201cWould he have left the city?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but he\u2019s probably at one of his many safehouses or even the Fel Temple. And even with your help, I realize I\u2019m in no condition to assault any of these places. I\u2019m going to have to heal up and try again. It\u2019s going to be difficult staying low now that I\u2019ve made my presence known. Look, I appreciate the help even though I tricked you into it, but this really isn\u2019t your concern. You have your own concerns and our paths split long ago. You are under no obligation to help me any further.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Lisa", "result": "While you don\u2019t like that you were lied to, there\u2019s not much for it now. While you aren\u2019t sure if someone saw your face, at least one of those assassins got away and is probably undoubtedly going to say that Lisa had help.\n\nYou might as well help Lisa, if only to potentially save your own ass trouble in the future. Plus, you\u2019d be lying if you didn\u2019t feel a little something to actually want to help her.\n\n\u201cWhile I wished you had told me the truth immediately, I\u2019m not going to just leave you hanging because honestly, I think this is a suicide mission for you. You can\u2019t take down this Mantis without some help.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not going to turn down your help and I will fully appreciate it, but you helping me isn\u2019t going to be a problem is it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you mean with my special lady vampire as you put it? Well, I\u2019m inclined not to tell her, but I probably shouldn\u2019t since she\u2019s not an idiot and will find out anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t she be upset with you?\u201d\n\u201cYou might think that, but I dunno she\u2019s been around a long time and certain things don\u2019t necessarily bother her the way you might think they would. I mean I\u2019ll explain the situation\u2026and well I guess I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to mess your shit up so if you can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s perfectly fine. I mean this is my problem and we aren\u2019t together anyway. However, if you can help, meet me in five days at the Holgard graveyard at night. I need to heal up a bit and probably track down where Mantis is actually hiding out at now anyway. Who knows, maybe if we\u2019re really lucky that firebomb killed him after all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll leave you to it. Take care in the mean time and hopefully we\u2019ll meet up later.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave of Lisa and get out of Holgard as quick as possible.\n\nWhen you get home, Isabella immediately notices you look a little battle worn.\n\n\u201cYou run into trouble dear?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cRan into an old\u2026acquaintance. It was a mess and uh...well there\u2019s still unfinished business.\u201d You answer awaiting the storm.\n\nIsabella looks at you for a moment.\n\n\u201cOkay, first question. Did you at least get my supplies?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cYes, I have them right here.\u201d You say handing over your pack to her.\n\u201cGood. Second question. This acquaintance, wouldn\u2019t happen to be a girl would it? Possibly even an ex from your mortal life?\u201d\n\u201cShe is. Or was. She was a girl from Dert that I was with during my time enslaved to Ral. I lost contact with her during my time getting experimented on by Ral.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? Odd that you\u2019ve never mentioned her before.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about my old flames with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou really think I\u2019d get jealous about that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just felt it was respectful not to bring them up.\u201d\n\u201cHah\u2026nice answer. You always do know how to say the right things. Okay, so I guess my next question would have been are you fucking this mortal, but I\u2019m going to guess that\u2019s a no, so just tell me what\u2019s going on and why you\u2019re involved.\u201d\n\nAs short as you can, you explain your entire night; you also add that part of the reason you want to help is you think that in all the chaos one of the assassins got away and while probably not recognizing you they will definitely know there was another helper and the last thing you want is to bring chaos home.\n\n\u201cI see. Well under normal circumstances, I\u2019d say kill this little mortal bitch for lying and present her head to the Ebony Claw since she got you into this mess in the first place. However, I get that you probably don\u2019t want to do that and knowing the ECS, that might not help anyway. Pftt. The Syndicate. I remember when they were still just a petty gang of thugs in the fledging Delantium Kingdom at one point. Okay, you\u2019re supposed to meet her in five days right?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cYes, in the graveyard there.\u201d\n\u201cHow original. Okay, since this is potentially going to impact our home and life together, I\u2019m going to help you and your little human ex out. However that means I\u2019m going to do some of my own investigation.\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay! That\u2019s great! I mean this will definitely make everything easier. I guess we can\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe? Oh no no no no my dear. I\u2019m going to do this by myself. I work better alone in situations like this. You are going to stay as far away as possible from Holgard.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re not going to attack the ECS yourself are you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, I\u2019m just going to do my own reconnaissance because I haven\u2019t been to the city in decades and it might help if I knew the lay out. Not to mention I can probably gain information that you or this Lisa girl would not be able to. You just take a break and I dunno, collect dinner from Dert while I\u2019m out. Then in five days we\u2019ll meet up with your human.\u201d\n\nIsabella\u2019s reaction to this wasn\u2019t at all what you were expecting. You thought that maybe she\u2019d be mildly annoyed and maybe she\u2019d be fine with you taking care of this due to potential repercussions. You didn\u2019t however expect her direct help. You guess it makes sense as you are mated after all, but the fact she doesn\u2019t want you to get in her way is puzzling.\n\nWell in any case, she trusts you, so you trust her and if this is how she wants to do it, then this is how its going.\n\nYou spend the next four nights basically hanging around the home. You go to Dert once to lure a couple of people to the cells, but for the most part that\u2019s it. Meanwhile Isabella nearly leaves immediately when the sun goes down and then stays out until it\u2019s nearly time for it to come back up.\n\nShe never elaborates on what she\u2019s doing except to mention that Holgard has only gotten worse since the last time she was there and says the whole city should be cleansed from the map for the good of everyone.\n\nOn the fourth night she comes home a little earlier and is entirely in the mood to have a round of wild rough sex. You aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s prompting this, though it could be the potential idea that you\u2019ll all be going into battle soon. Either way, you\u2019ve never complained before so why start now?\n\nFinally the fifth night arrives.\n\n\u201cGet up my love. It\u2019s time to end this.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\nAs you and Isabella make your way to Holgard, you start to ask her questions about what she was doing during her time in Holgard, but she just smiles and says to not worry about it since she\u2019ll reaveal all when you get to the graveyard.\n\n\u201cYou trust me don\u2019t you?\u201d she asks.\n\u201c\u2026well I trust that you aren\u2019t planning anything sinister for me, but I must admit all this secrecy is a bit concerning.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou worry too much.\u201d\n\nEventually you get to the graveyard. Lisa isn\u2019t really hanging around in plain site, but you can sense she must be around, Isabella on the other hand calls her own immediately.\n\n\u201cLittle human, come on out from behind the fifth tomb from the left with the broken statue on top of it. Don\u2019t worry it\u2019s safe, nothing but us vampires out here.\u201d She says.\n\nReluctantly and very cautiously Lisa steps out from her hiding space. Her guard is up causing Isabella to roll her eyes.\n\n\u201cHonestly, your ex offers to bail your ass out after you lied and you give this sort of welcome? And please, if I wanted to kill you, you\u2019d already be dead so put that away.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cI take it this is your better half? Didn\u2019t expect her to actually help. Where are her clothes?\u201d Lisa remarks putting her weapon away.\n\u201cIsabella has long since abandoned the desire to wear such things.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI thought maybe it was just her way of bragging of how beautiful she was.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I\u2019ll take that as a compliment, human. And I suppose you were probably pretty back in your younger years. I can see how he would have had a fondness for you.\u201d\n\nThis is getting weird, so you step in before it turns worse.\n\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019re both pretty princesses, now let\u2019s get on with this. The both of you have been stalking these city streets so what\u2019s the situation?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure. I mean I\u2019ve interrogated a few EC members and done what investigating I could without alerting the EC of my presence. All I know is Mantis is indeed alive and he\u2019s either in a safehouse down in the sewers under Dagger Row or he\u2019s hiding out in the Temple of Fel. I\u2019m really hoping it\u2019s the safehouse, because I don\u2019t fancy the chances of attacking a Fel Temple and I doubt if we\u2019ll even be able to sneak in. I mean these are followers of the God of Shadow.\u201d\n\u201cOh he\u2019s definitely in the Fel Temple, in fact we should go make our way there now.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re saying he\u2019s there for certain? How do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m better than you human, that\u2019s why, now are we settling this or what?\u201d\n\u201cIsabella, you have been fairly mysterious about what you\u2019ve been doing here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise for you dear. Both of you just follow my lead in all this and we\u2019ll all get home before the dawn.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re probably old and\u2026\u201d\n\nIsabella glares at Lisa for that remark. Meanwhile Lisa looks like she just pissed herself.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 powerful, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDear, tell your human to stop speaking before this act of kindness becomes for naught.\u201d Isabella remarks in an annoyed tone.\n\u201cI think you better just keep quiet Lisa.\u201d You say.\n\nThe three of you make your way to the Temple of Fel. Isabella gives exactly zero fucks as she walks naked through the streets of Holgard. As expected she gets more than a few looks by the few folks still out at night, but nobody says anything. Not lewd comments, not protests, nothing. Not even the group of watchmen that you walk by say anything. Isabella\u2019s powers of mind control are in full affect.\n\n\u201cYour girlfriend isn\u2019t exactly subtle.\u201d Lisa whispers to you.\n\u201cYeah well when you\u2019re that powerful, you tend to not give a shit about things. I\u2019m actually less concerned about the Watch and more concerned about EC assassins, Fel touched or not. I feel like being so obvious like this we\u2019d be getting attacked by now given that they\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they won\u2019t, I told you, all will be revealed when we get to the temple now cut the chatter and keep up.\u201d Isabella snaps.\n\nThe rest of your journey is uneventful until you get close to the Fel Temple and that\u2019s when you see a group dressed purple and blue robes. Dornans? What are they doing here?\n\nAn old man steps from the group when the three of you approach.\n\n\u201cIsabella, always a pleasure to see you.\u201d He remarks with a bit of a upbeat tone.\n\u201cYes, yes, Flynn I know you love me, but we\u2019re here on important business. Is all the shit sorted out with the Felians? Because I was planning on getting this done with quick.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cYes, The Felians are more interested in keeping the religious peace rather than protecting one of their Ebony Claw associates. So yes, they are completely willing to turn this Mantis character over and apparently his treachery has been exposed by whatever limited process that their shadow magic does anyway, so this appears to be a settled affair as soon as you meet with them.\u201d Flynn remarks.\n\nYou and Lisa are overwhelmed with surprise. You can\u2019t believe this.\n\n\u201cWait. That\u2019s it? We\u2019re not fighting anyone?\u201d you say.\n\u201cMantis is just being turned over? Just like that? I\u2019m actually cleared?!\u201d Lisa adds.\n\u201cYes, you may provide your undying thanks to me later, for now though let\u2019s continue.\u201d Isabella remarks eager to get on with it.\n\nAs the three of you start to leave, Flynn calls out.\n\n\u201cIsabella\u2026\u201d Flynn says, causing Isabella to turn around exasperated.\n\u201cFlynn, look, I thanked you for this already, but that\u2019s all it was okay? Nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cBut I just thought\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know what you thought and you were wrong as usual. This is why I always went for Ral instead of you back in the day. You were a spineless worm that thought just being a compliant was good enough for me. Goodbye Flynn.\u201d\n\nIsabella looks at you.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know you went out with the leader of the Dornan temple.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah well I used my ex to help out your ex. Come on.\u201d\n\nThe three of you head to the Fel Temple, which you see a single cloaked figured looming at the bottom of the steps of it. Near him is a crumpled figure. You notice that this is the same assassin with the shock of white hair throwing around firebombs last time. He nods at the three of you.\n\nThe crumpled figure on the ground is Mantis, he\u2019s alive, but he doesn\u2019t look too good. He\u2019s pale and emaciated looking and he\u2019s shivering the entire time while mumbling nonsense quietly. Certainly looks different than the last time you saw him years ago.\n\n\u201cGreetings again. I am here on the behalf of the Master of Shadows as he has other important matters. As I remember you are the one called Lisa?\u201d he asks, pointing to her.\n\u201cI am\u2026what did you do to Mantis?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cOnly what was required to keep order and peace. This man attempted to use Fel to hide his actions, but he didn\u2019t realize that he can\u2019t hide his actions from Fel who sees all things hidden. Things might have gone better had he not resisted. Perhaps even a compromise could have been reached, but as you can see he chose otherwise and by the time he begged for mercy\u2026well it was far too late.\u201d\n\nLisa steps forward.\n\n\u201cAnd what about me?\u201d Lisa asks.\n\u201cYour name has been cleared\u2026well more or less. I\u2019m sure thanks to your actions, you have most likely angered other EC members and you will most likely still have to watch your back, such is the nature of the business. However, the general order of elimination will be lifted and more importantly, Fel is not seeking retribution. Still, you may want to watch yourself for awhile.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it then.\u201d\n\u201cThat is indeed it for this situation. I leave you with your revenge, though perhaps it may be a mercy now. And since you have caught the attention of Fel, perhaps if you ever feel you\u2019re up to the challenge, you would be more than welcome to join the shadow of Fel. You will find that being obedient to him, will make you much more efficient in your tasks.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\nThe man then turns around and then suddenly cloaks into invisibility, though you can still sense him until he goes back into the temple.\n\n\u201cOkay, looks like that\u2019s done. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\u201cWait. I don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d Lisa says.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t mortal, think of this as your lucky night.\u201d\n\u201cActually I can think of a way.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou best pick your next words with care.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\n\u201cNo, not that! It\u2019s just before all this shit happened, I was thinking about home and getting a message to my family. Lisa, do you remember my stories to you about Teckleville?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, I do remember.\u201d Lisa remarks.\n\u201cWell, do you think in between your assassinations, you could go see my family and assure them that I\u2019m doing okay? I mean I\u2019d do it\u2026but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSay no more. I\u2019d be more than willing to relay a general message of your happiness.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Lisa.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you. I mean that and will never forget this.\u201d\n\u201cAlright now we really are going. Say goodbye to your little human and for her sake she better never cross your path, let alone mine ever again.\u201d Isabella remarks.\n\nYou and Isabella leave Lisa to her revenge on Mantis. You turn to look one last time and see her finish him off.\n\nOdd night, you were expecting a huge and very likely deadly battle, but it all worked out very easy. In any case, you follow Isabella who probably is anxious to get back to her garden. She\u2019s been away from it for far too long for her.\n\nYou know she went out of her way to help you and you also know that she\u2019s annoyed that she had to, but you also know that she must care about you very much that she did.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you love this woman.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave Lisa to deal with this", "result": "Maybe if Lisa had been upfront with you it would be different, but you really don\u2019t like being lied to and given that Lisa is telling you that you don\u2019t need to help her and she\u2019s got this, you don\u2019t feel exactly obligated.\n\n\u201cOkay, if you say you got this then I\u2019ll take my leave. Just be careful all right and good luck.\u201d you say.\n\u201cI will, and it was good to see you again\u2026I\u2026I wish things had been different.\u201d Lisa says with a mildly sad tone in her voice.\n\u201cYeah, me too sometimes.\u201d\n\nYou leave Lisa behind in the alley and make your way as quickly as you can out of Holgard. You\u2019re ready to be done with this night.\n\nWhen you get home, Isabella immediately notices you look a little battle worn.\n\n\u201cYou run into trouble dear?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cRan into an old\u2026acquaintance. It was a mess. It\u2019s settled though.\u201d You answer not really wishing to go much into it, but prepared to explain if you have to.\n\nIsabella looks at you for a moment.\n\n\u201cOkay. Did you at least get my supplies?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have them right here.\u201d You say handing over your pack to her.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the type of relationship you have with Isabella. She trusts you. If you say it got taken care of, then it\u2019s taken care of.\n\nYou avoid Holgard for a while. While you don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any danger, the last thing you need is to run into some other old face causing shit for you. It would be just your luck that you\u2019d run into Tych again.\n\nMonths pass and you eventually go to Holgard again to pick up some things for Isabella. Not that you\u2019re doing much mingling or listening to rumors, but you know enough that the Ebony Claw Syndicate is still firmly in control of the underworld here so you guess Lisa didn\u2019t exactly bring them down, but then she was only trying to kill one specific person.\n\nYou have no idea about this Mantis though, if he\u2019s dead, alive, or what. Same for Lisa. In any case you hope she got her revenge at least.\n\nYear 35\n\nYou wake up to the sounds of several feet coming the stairs. You can\u2019t tell how many, but you already are getting the push by Isabella who is awake and ready for a fight.\n\n\u201cGet up! We\u2019re being attacked!\u201d she shouts.\n\nYou get up and you\u2019re already hearing shouting from the foyer.\n\n\u201cFucking hunters! I\u2019ll water my garden with their blood for intruding on my home!\u201d Isabella shouts and is already gone to meet the invaders. Screams soon follow.\n\nYou head out to join the fight and there is a whole lot more light than usual thanks to all the torches. After striking down a few of them, you notice an ebony claw tattoo on some of them.\n\nThese aren\u2019t hunters.\n\n\u201cShit! There\u2019s two of them! Why didn\u2019t someone check this?!\u201d one of them shouts.\n\nMultiple gunshots are fired at you and Isabella and in these narrow catacombs, even as quick as you are, you\u2019re still catching a few bullets. Unfortunately, the Ebony Claw has prepared well and loaded their firearms with silver shot. It hurts like hell, but you fight through the pain and take out the closest fucker with a gun in his hand.\n\nYou feel a blade sinking into your back, which feels like a burning piece of steel, though it\u2019s probably silver again. You turn around and find yourself face to cowl with one of those Fel assassins that teleported behind you. You get another silver blade in your gut before you twist his head backwards.\n\nSeverely wounded you quicken your pace to where Isabella is. She\u2019s managed to push them all the way back to the foyer all by herself. Blood and bodies are everywhere. You\u2019re damn glad she\u2019s on your side.\n\nYou reach the foyer just in time to see several round metal objects bounce down the stairs and on the floor. Isabella is finishing off two more assassins and hasn\u2019t seen the cluster of firebombs yet.\n\nYou immediately pull her away and throw her into the nearby corridor just as the bombs are exploding. You try to shield Isabella, and catch some of the blast.\n\nYour flesh burns from your bones, your bones crack and break, some of your internal organs melt and it feels like your whole body has been dunked in acid. You scream out something unnatural, but it isn\u2019t for long because everything goes black.\n\nYou\u2019re out and you don\u2019t know for how long.\n\n\u201cBeloved! You there? Can you hear me?\u201d you hear, but your vision is still black.\n\u201cMufh hungh\u2026gh\u2026\u201d is all you can utter before you\u2019re out again.\n\nTime passes\u2026\n\nYou open you eyes and find your vision is severely impaired. You have no depth perception and the eye that does work is very blurry. You still feel like your body is on fire, but you can\u2019t scream out. You must be laying on a table or something because you are elevated. Still, you can make out an outline of a woman standing near someone in a chair nearby.\n\n\u201cI SWEAR! I SWEAR TO FEL AND ALL THE GODS, I DON\u2019T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE! PLEASE! GRANT ME MERCY!\u201d\n\nYour hearing works at least.\n\nYou struggle to sit up, but it\u2019s no use. You don\u2019t have the energy and collapse again.\n\nMore time passes\u2026\n\nYou open your eyes again. Still no depth perception, but your vision is a little clearer. You can finally tell where you\u2019re at. You\u2019re still at home, and lying on one of the many slabs in the crypt.\n\nYour body hurts less, but you\u2019re still not feeling good. You try to sit up again and that\u2019s when you realize you\u2019re a bloody mess.\n\nBoth of your legs are missing, or at least missing enough that you wouldn\u2019t be able to walk. Attempting to reach out only results in your right arm being able to do so since your left is a skeletal stump at the elbow.\n\nSpeaking of skeletal, you can sense that part of your spine is exposed to the world and what lies inside you isn\u2019t fairing much better. You can see your blackened heart beating through your ribcage.\n\nWhile you\u2019re an undead monster, that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t find all this a bit alarming.\n\n\u201cOh shit\u2026shit\u2026shit\u2026fuck\u2026fuck!\u201d you start to say with an increased tone in your voice.\n\nIsabella soon comes running in. You notice she\u2019s in relatively good condition though one side of her face is scarred and parts of her body are also burned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Isabella asks.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Look at me! I\u2026I can\u2019t fucking live like this! Please just put me out of my fucking misery!\u201d you say and you\u2019re almost close to tears.\n\nIsabella goes over to sooth you as you continue to panic.\n\n\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s okay. This is the first time you\u2019ve been maimed severely. Yeah, I panicked a bit too when it first happened to me centuries ago and I didn\u2019t even have anyone with me to help either. We\u2019re more resilient than you think. You\u2019ll heal up. It\u2019s gonna take a long time, but you WILL be in one piece again eventually.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026I will?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah. Just takes blood. How do you think I got you this healed up in the first place? I\u2019m been using the blood of the assholes that attacked us, the Dert citizens and my own for days trying to heal you and myself up. We\u2019re going to have to be moving on soon though, as much as I hate it, but it\u2019s just not ideal anymore. The Ebony Claw will undoubtedly regroup and send more of their fools to try to kill us.\u201d\n\u201cWait, did you kill them all?\u201d\n\u201cI probably would have had it not been daylight. I only managed to run down three of them before the sunlight was burning my fine undead ass to a crisp. Still, got quite a bit of information out of them. Didn\u2019t know you were wanted by them for helping an old girlfriend of yours a year ago. Guessing that\u2019s the thing you thought was taken care of? Looks like it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re at a loss for words.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I fucked up.\u201d You finally utter.\n\u201cYou most certainly did fuck up. I hope she was worth the poke and cuddle, because after they caught and tortured the shit out of her before they killed her that\u2019s how they found out about where you lived. Fortunately she didn\u2019t know anything about me. I\u2019m guessing you never told her.\u201d Isabella responds.\n\u201cShit. I DID tell her about you! I mean not in so many words, but she guessed I had a special vampire lady in my life as she put it. And I most certainly did not have sex with her! I swear!\u201d\n\nYou give a brief rundown of what exactly happened that night you met Lisa. Isabella listens intently. Now you\u2019re worried that Isabella isn\u2019t going to believe you and is keeping you alive to make your existence horrible.\n\n\u201cCalm down, I believe you. Though I\u2019d almost say it probably would\u2019ve been better if you\u2019d fucked her. At least you would have gotten something out of all this. Also might have been better if you had helped her. She might not have blabbed about this place. Apparently they were planning on ambushing you in Holgard, but since I haven\u2019t needed anything from there lately, you haven\u2019t been going. So they fell back on attacking directly and have been gearing up to raid this place for the past few months. Well what\u2019s done is done now.\u201d\n\u201cAt the risk of actually pissing you off, I\u2019m curious to as why you aren\u2019t angrier.\u201d\n\u201cAt you? Well, I am pissed at you, but considering you\u2019re currently a piece of mutilated meat that\u2019s still in pain and has a long way to go before getting back to normal, I think this was your punishment. Honestly my anger is directed towards the bottom feeding mortals that dared attack in the first place. I don\u2019t care what sort of connections they have; I\u2019ll take down the entire ECS in Holgard and then some just so they remember they picked the wrong vampire to order a hit on. You\u2019ll be helping of course.\u201d\n\nNothing like a purpose.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m not exactly able right now.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean now. We\u2019re going to move to a new location. Probably Ral\u2019s old home in the meantime. I already checked it out and surprisingly nobody was even squatting there. That will just be temporary though, until you\u2019re healed up enough to walk on your own. We\u2019ll probably need to wipe out the remainder of Dert in order to get enough blood, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s we\u2019re going to be living here anymore anyway. After that we\u2019re both going to Holgard, and we\u2019re going to cause so much mayhem, they\u2019ll think there\u2019s a new civil war going on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t give up on me for this.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I made a commitment to you, for good or bad times and right now this is bad, but it\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t get over. Come on, hold on to me, we\u2019re heading to our new temporary home\u2026.I\u2019m really going to miss my garden.

She shouts something, but you don\u2019t even hear it, you just rush her.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t even get off a shot, you knock her to the ground and get on top of her.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d she utters and then you rip out her throat with your fangs and taste her blood.\n\nYou then sense another figure hovering near you and you throw a punch to his kneecap, shattering it.

I guess I can see your point even if I think you\u2019re being short sighted on this matter. Perhaps I came across a little too aggressively, but as I said, isolation has made me a bit less focused on the whole courtship process. In any case, apologies.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026well I accept. I have to say, I thought you were going to be madder than you are.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I be mad, I said I get where you\u2019re coming from. You clearly have strong feelings for this girl. Strong enough that you risked facing me believing I was going to go into some frothing vampire rage no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cWell that was the concern.\u201d\n\u201cHah, you needn\u2019t have done so.

There\u2019s nothing tying you here anyway. Heather hasn\u2019t showed up and is unlikely to do so, you were just holding out hope for something that was never really there in the first place.\n\nRemembering Heather\u2019s advice about going north, you start looking at various maps that Ral had stashed around his lab. For someone who spent most of his time in his lab, he certainly had some detailed ones. You never really looked at them before, but now\u2019s the time.\n\nYou focus on his northern maps to see where you might be heading. Besides your forced foray into the wintery wilderness, you honestly don\u2019t know much about the great north other than there are some small settlements up there.\n\nAfter some perusing of a map, you decide to make your way to some place just called \u201cEvergreen.\u201d It\u2019s probably the closest northern settlement you\u2019ll reach from your current location.

You\u2019ve probably spent more time in uncivilized wilderness than populated centers. You never thought that would happen, but it has, and you\u2019ve gotten used to it. Then of course, you never thought a lot of stuff would happen.\n\nYour roguish days have slowly been coming to an end for years now, in fact it probably could be argued that you haven\u2019t really been one since you left Teckleville. Though you suppose in some ways your skills have just been used for other purposes. Maybe you could set yourself up as a trapper or hunter? You\u2019ve certainly got more skill in tracking large animals and beasts now.\n\nSpeaking of large beasts, you remind yourself that you\u2019re going to have to try to get Spikey to follow you. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but you figure you can\u2019t really leave him to prowl around here or else Isabella will kill him.\n\nYou pack what you can and leave note on the door for Isabella saying you\u2019ve left since you figure it doesn\u2019t hurt to be polite to a vampire that did at least give you an option.\n\nAfter a bit of searching (Doesn\u2019t take long) you finally manage to get Spikey to mildly follow you, though he does a lot of wandering off for long periods of time presumably to hunt. You aren\u2019t really sure if he\u2019s going to follow you the whole way or disappear along the way, but at least you\u2019re getting him away from potential danger. You briefly wonder if maybe you could try to ride him to make the journey faster, but while Spikey is tolerant of you, you doubt if he\u2019s going allow himself to be anyone\u2019s steed!\n\nBeing driven away from a place you called home for so very long seems very familiar.

You figure by the time you get to Sivak you will have a clearer idea of what your long term plans are.\n\nWith this goal in mind, you backtrack around Teckleville, maintaining caution the entire time. You stick mainly to wooded areas, hoping that you not only don\u2019t run into someone from Teckleville trying to hunt you down, but potentially anything worse. You\u2019ve never really been big on hanging out in the wilderness after all so you don\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nWhen you once again put enough distance between you and Teckleville again, you slowly start exiting the wooded areas (which are starting to thin anyway) and start following the road directly.\n\nThe road itself is empty for most of the time, though you do pass a couple merchant caravans heading in the opposite direction. You just think how if you were still in Teckleville, you probably would have been stealing from them.\n\nWhenever night starts to fall you temporarily get off the road and sleep in the fields behind whatever cover you can find though you never really sleep easily and are constantly waking up at various sounds.\n\nDespite being on the road for a few days, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ve actually crossed into Delantium territory until you see a sign post along side the road that states that fact. Not far from the signpost is a building, probably a roadside inn of some sort.\n\nAs you make your way towards the inn, you hear the clopping of horses behind you. At first you get concerned that someone from Teckleville is galloping your way, but a quick glance shows it\u2019s probably just some other travellers given their relaxed pace.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s getting dark again and as much as you\u2019re getting used to sleeping outside, you\u2019d prefer to sleep on a normal bed for a change. You just hope that you\u2019ve got enough for a room.\n\nYou enter the inn, which is fairly empty. An older woman sweeps the floor, while an older man stands behind a bar. You see a couple of people sitting at tables, but none of them really pay much attention to you.\n\nYou figure that the man behind the bar is the innkeeper so you go up to him to ask how much for a room. The price he gives you is just out of your price range, too bad you can\u2019t just \u201csteal a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, you can\u2019t cut me a break? I\u2019m only a few coppers short.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI cut you a break, and all of a sudden I get a reputation that I just let everyone walk all over me. Before I know it I got every wanderer in the region asking for handouts. No! You pay the price or get the hell outta my establishment!\u201d the innkeeper exclaims.\n\n\u201cRen, you oughta be glad anyone even pays for the misfortune of staying at this shitty establishment!\u201d you hear a voice chuckle.\n\nYou turn and see three people walking in the place, probably the travellers that you saw earlier. The speaker (and presumably leader of the group) is a man dressed in leather armor with a sword by his side. His two companions are dressed in a similar manner.\n\n\u201cFlynt! Been awhile since you\u2019ve stopped by. You want the usual?\u201d Ren remarks.\n\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d\n\nThe innkeeper calls to the older woman (probably his wife) to go get the special wine from the cellar and then begins exchanging pleasantries with Flynt and his men. He seems to have forgotten about you entirely, though this Flynt seems to be looking over in your direction a bit.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to leave, Flynt calls over to you.\n\n\u201cHey son, don\u2019t you still want that room?\u201d Flynt asks.\n\u201cUm\u2026well yeah, but I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah, money is always an issue these days, but I think I\u2019ve got a solution to your problem. Just hold on a moment while we get our drinks.\u201d\n\nFlynt hands over a few gold coins to Ren who takes them and then heads over to a table. He then waves you over to come sit with him and his buddies. You figure it can\u2019t hurt to hear what he has to say.\n\n\u201cSooo, where you from son?\u201d Flynt asks.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHey, Mr. Flynt asked you a question!\u201d one of Flynt\u2019s friends snaps.\n\u201cEasy there! We\u2019re just having a conversation, not an interrogation! I apologize for my friend; sometimes our line of work keeps one on edge. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to tell us where you\u2019re from, a man has a right to his secrets.\u201d Flynt says in a cordial tone.\n\nThe one guy who snapped at you is still giving you a hard look, meanwhile the other one isn\u2019t paying too much mind to you at all and is focused on his drink. Flynt of course is still smiling at you from across the table.\n\nYou aren\u2019t quite sure how to play this so you decide to go with your immediate thoughts.\n\n\u201cSo you said something about solving my money problems?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cStraight to the point. I can appreciate that. You want to get the how out of the way.\u201d Flynt says.\n\u201cActually I was thinking more about the why.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, suspicious type aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s a good quality. Smart. Yes, I may indeed have an ulterior motive\u2026but let me ask you this first. Are you familiar with the shadowy arts?\u201d\n\nYou look a bit wary at Flynt and his fellows after that question.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry son, we\u2019re not soldiers for the Delantium Kingdom or any other law men if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. I just get a vibe from you, that you might be\u2026shall I say skilled in the less than legal endeavors. I\u2019m usually good at judging people with only a bit of observation\u2026so am I right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026if I was\u2026and I\u2019m not saying that I am. What business is it of yours?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell it could be that this is an opportunity you won\u2019t want to miss. Especially seeing as you\u2019re currently too poor to afford a room in this shithole. Look, here\u2019s the deal, we\u2019re in a little trouble with the law right now and have to lay low for a while. In fact we\u2019re probably going to be leaving soon after we have our drinks. However, I have to make a delivery to a man in Sivak, are you familiar with the city?\u201d\n\u201cI was heading that way, but I\u2019ve never been there.\u201d\n\u201cOh just stay on this road, heed the signs and you really can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\nFlynt takes another drink before continuing.\n\n\u201cAs I said, I have to make a delivery to a man by the name of Crasnov. He runs a pottery shop by the same name. If you could take this package to him when you reach the city, I\u2019d certainly be in your debt.\u201d\n\nAt this point Flynt pulls out a fist sized wrapped bundle and pushes it towards you. He then pulls out twenty gold coins and puts them right next to the bundle.\n\n\u201cNow, the only rules are, you don\u2019t tamper with it and you definitely don\u2019t give it to anyone else except Crasnov. If you accomplish that, you will be rewarded with more money and I guarantee you will have the thanks of some powerful friends. Friends that may call upon you for other lucrative opportunities.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re basically paying me to be a courier?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIf you wish to see it that way. If I were you though, I would see it as a first step to become an important person in certain circles.\u201d\n\nTwenty gold coins up front just to deliver a package and more reward afterwards seems like a pretty good deal. Plus the making connections bit is what entices you a bit more.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the job.\u201d You say.\n\u201cKnew you were a smart and ambitious boy. Good, glad this is settled. Now judging the distance from here to Sivak, and you should get there in about four more days as long as you follow the roads and keep on a normal timetable of walking and resting. Too bad you don\u2019t have a horse; otherwise you\u2019d easily cut that time in half. I do urge you NOT to take too much longer than six days though.\u201d Flynt says.\n\u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t get there in six days?\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s just say many people would be upset with you. If you\u2019re concerned with being timely however, you can probably buy a horse with some of that new money, over in Hegglesburg. You should reach that town by tomorrow and they might have a horse you can buy.\u201d\n\nYou nod and thank Flynt while pocketing the coins and grabbing the package.\n\n\u201cWell I trust you know just about all you need to. Remember, that package is very important, so guard it carefully. Though I don\u2019t expect that you\u2019re going to have any problems, Delantium\u2019s military definitely makes sure bandits and the like are less of a threat, especially on the roads.\u201d Flynt remarks.\n\u201cYeah speaking of that, should I be worried about getting stopped by the law?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhy? Are YOU a wanted criminal son?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026no I guess not.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. You guess not? Not sure are we? Well let me rephrase\u2026are you a wanted criminal within the Delantium Kingdom?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is my first time within its borders actually.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re safe son. You aren\u2019t going to get randomly hassled. You just look like another young wanderer. Just keep your head down around the law and you should be fine. Was there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, my fellows and I are going to finish our drinks and then get back on our way. Unlike you, we don\u2019t have the luxury of an unknown reputation. Such is our burden in life. I trust you\u2019ll want to get some rest for your journey tomorrow. Perhaps we\u2019ll meet again in the future.\u201d\n\nFlynt wishes you good luck and returns to finishing up his drink. His friends are doing likewise and you take that as your sign to leave the table.\n\nYou return to Ren and hand him a gold coin for a room to which he just grunts and hands you a key.\n\n\u201cUpstairs, last room on the left. Best one in the establishment. You\u2019re out of here by morning.\u201d He says.\n\nYou head upstairs and make your way to your room.\n\nWhen you open the door, the room is nothing special. It\u2019s not bad, just nothing that would stand out to think this is a good one. Still, if this is the best room, it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t get one of the lesser ones.\n\nYou settle in for the night thinking about your task. You didn\u2019t expect to get someone approaching you to perform a job, even if it is just a courier one. Still, this seems pretty low risk for decent money so you\u2019re not complaining.\n\nYou go to sleep wondering if things are starting to look up for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next morning", "result": "\u201cBUST IT DOWN!\u201d a voice shouts followed by the splintering of your door.\n\nYou\u2019re barely awake before you\u2019re rushed by several men dressed in chainmail.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T MOVE!\u201d one shouts as several spears are pointed directly at you.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d one of the men says and pokes you in the chest with his spear hard enough that it superficially breaks the skin.\n\nYou don\u2019t say any more, but between the men holding you at bay with spears and a couple other searching your room, you fear the worst. One of them inevitably grabs the package you put under your bed.

The cart is going slow enough that you could probably easily jump out and just run. The problem with that plan is there are multiple mounted guards to the front and back of you. They would easily run you down and most likely kill you for attempting to escape.\n\nThe second thing you can think of is what the sergeant said. Something about the Ebony Claw Syndicate. You can make an educated guess that Flynt and his friends were part of this organization.

You figure if you\u2019re going before a judge, you can always explain things to him and hope he takes mercy, though you aren\u2019t optimistic about it.\n\nLacking any other plan, you just sit in silence as the soldiers take you to your appointed destination. It\u2019s times like this, you wish your sister was here, she\u2019d be able to help you.\n\nIn fact you\u2019re starting to have a greater appreciation for your parents as well at this point. How many times did you avoid real trouble thanks to your father\u2019s influence?\n\nAs you ponder your life choices you glance at the other man in the cart who doesn\u2019t say anything to you. In fact he doesn\u2019t even really look at you. Upon a few more glances at him, you notice he has a tattoo of a black claw on his shoulder. You wonder if this man is a member of the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\n\nIf that is the case you realize it\u2019s probably a good thing that you didn\u2019t say anything about Flynt. The last thing you need right now is a pissed off gang member wanting to kill you for being a rat. In fact, it makes you wonder if you should say anything to the judge at all. If this Ebony Claw Syndicate is as sinister as they sound, it might be dangerous to go ratting on their people. Of course that doesn\u2019t leave you many options.\n\nYou mostly pass the rest of the time observing the scenery as you travel through Hegglesberg and farmlands.\n\nEventually though the sky darkens and the soldiers prepare to camp for the night.\n\n\u201cAlright we\u2019ll stop here for tonight and set up camp. Anders and Levin, you two can watch Mr. Scars and the kid and make sure they can\u2019t escape.\u201d The sergeant says.\n\nWith a few gruff orders, you and Mr. Scars are both taken to a nearby tree and tied to it securely with a rope while the rest of the soldiers make camp.\n\nAs you\u2019re watching the soldiers go about their jobs (And your guards doing more talking with each other than actually watching you) Mr. Scars finally says something to you.\n\n\u201cSo, busted with twenty vials of Blue Dream eh?\u201d he asks in a low tone.\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI heard the sergeant talking with one of his men about it earlier.\u201d\n\u201cOh. They think I\u2019m some big dealer and part of the Ebony Claw Syndicate too, but I\u2019m not either of those things.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Didn\u2019t think you were Claw, but I thought maybe you might be a prospect\u2026.hmmm\u2026let me guess did you run into a man going by the name Flynt?\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if you should be talking, so you don\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cHeh, I\u2019ll take your silence as a yes. Though I suppose it\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re not very forthcoming with that info. Talkers don\u2019t last long in this business. Of course maybe you\u2019re not telling me because you ripped him off\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d you exclaim which causes the guards to look over at you and then you get quiet again until they look away.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, he paid me to deliver a package to someone. I didn\u2019t even know what was in it, until the guards confiscated it. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know about the Ebony Claw Syndicate!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sounds like Flynt. It\u2019s an unconventional method of recruitment, but sometimes he likes to randomly test youngsters that he feels could be useful. Dunno why he does things that way, but when you\u2019ve got drugs and coins to blow, I guess you can afford to take risks like that. I dunno, I\u2019m just in it for the violence myself.\u201d\n\nYou continue to stay silent.\n\n\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re probably looking at twenty years kid. One for each vial. The kingdom has been really cracking down lately on it. Probably get sent to Dreadcage too. They send all the serious offenders there.\u201d\n\nFear wells up inside you upon hearing that news. You try to keep it together, but you\u2019re having a hard time and you start exhaling multiple times, closing your eyes and muttering, \u201coh fuck, oh shit.\u201d several times.\n\n\u201cWow, kid. You\u2019re not going to last in prison if you take that approach. They see you come in like that and you\u2019re gonna be sucking every dick in the joint and worse.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there something I can do to stop this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, you could try to escape I guess, but I\u2019m betting you already figured the soldiers would easily run you down before you got very far. I suppose you could try to beg for mercy when you go before the judge, maybe even use your youth as an excuse. Depending on the judge, that MIGHT get you some time shaved off, but you\u2019ll still be doing a lot of it\u2026and I think I don\u2019t have to warn you about the dangers of ratting out Flynt and whoever it was you were supposed to deliver to in the first place to try to save your ass.\u201d\n\nThis is just a nightmare. You\u2019re almost thinking maybe you should have just risked getting lynched back in Teckleville. At least there you would\u2019ve had your parents to help you and maybe even Annah, assuming she lived. At worst, you would have at least died at home.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I ain\u2019t no rat, so that wasn\u2019t ever a possibility anyway.\u201d You say in an attempt to at least make Mr. Scars less likely to be suspicious of you.\n\u201cBullshit kid, in your situation and first time? You probably thought about it. Don\u2019t worry though, everyone usually does at one time or another, just as long as you don\u2019t actually do it\u2026well either that or make damn sure the reward is high enough.\u201d Mr. Scars chuckles.\n\u201cYeah, well I might do better in prison than you think\u2026\u201d you say and then you whisper\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve killed someone before.\u201d\n\nMr. Scars looks at you as if to detect whether you\u2019re lying or not.\n\n\u201cHm, maybe you have, or maybe you haven\u2019t, but that really doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re going to be locked away with a lot of killers. Most of them a lot tougher and bigger than the likes of you. So just because you killed your girlfriend or mom because she pissed you off doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re some hard man.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill my\u2026\u201d you start to say before the one of the guards starts actually paying attention to you.\n\n\u201cHEY! The two of you stop fucking conspiring over there! In fact the pair of you need to shut the fuck up and just go to sleep because tomorrow you\u2019ll both be going before the judge and sentenced for your crimes! Enjoy your last night of freedom criminal scum!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, you and Mr. Scars do no more talking for the rest of the night, though Mr. Scars was done talking and ready to sleep anyway. You on the other hand have a hard time getting to sleep, knowing what awaits you.\n\nThe next morning, you\u2019re put back on the cart and continue your journey to Sivak. You reach your destination by midday. Sivak is larger than anything you\u2019ve ever seen and some of its buildings are very impressive. It\u2019s a very bustling place with people walking around everywhere. You just wish you were free to enjoy it.\n\nAt this point you wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just try to escape now. The streets are very busy and it would be a lot harder for the soldiers to get around on their horses. If you\u2019re quick enough you might even lose them in an alleyway or something. Of course that doesn\u2019t stop the fact that you\u2019re still shackled and ultimately surrounded by more soldiers than ever, but maybe you can figure that dilemma out later.", "action_results": [{"action": "Escape", "result": "Maybe this is a foolish decision, but you have to try.

Mr. Scars just smiles a bit sensing what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nYou jump from the cart and into a group of passing citizens, which happily prevent you from falling directly into the cobblestones. You quickly get up off the mass of bodies and start running.\n\n\u201cSTOP! STOP THAT MAN!\u201d one guard shouts.\n\u201cSomebody grab him!\u201d another remarks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, get his ass!\u201d the sergeant exclaims.\n\u201cRun rabbit! Run!\u201d Mr. Scars laughs.\n\nYou run through the streets of Sivak, crashing and bumping into people along the way. Surprisingly or maybe not so surprisingly nobody is really trying to stop you on purpose, the average citizens seem to be more concerned with getting the hell out of your way.\n\nThe soldiers are still trying to chase you on horseback, but it\u2019s proving a little more difficult with all the people in the way. The funny thing is they\u2019re actually doing MORE damage by trampling over several citizens in their efforts to get to you!\n\nEventually you make so many turns down various twisting narrow streets, the soldiers on horseback can\u2019t effectively follow, but the new ones on foot that have been alerted continue the pursuit just fine.\n\nYou probably would be able to evade your pursuers if not for the fact that your hands are shackled behind you and you don\u2019t know your way around the city. That\u2019s very apparent, when you find that you\u2019ve just run around in a circle and surrounded by soldiers.\n\n\u201cSurrender now and we might even leave you in good enough condition to stand before the judge!\u201d one of the soldiers says.\n\nYou can\u2019t surrender. Not now. You were meant to be free and if you can\u2019t be free then it\u2019s no life at all.\n\nYou attempt to pass the soldiers in front of you and are met by their spears. To their credit, they actually do try to subdue you first by slamming you to the ground, but when you continue to struggle and kick, one of the less patient ones skewers you in the side which is then followed by another spear to your chest.

In fact maybe Yag has blessed you with a little luck given your situation.\u201d\n\u201cLuck? I\u2019m on my way to prison!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you had the fortune of meeting me in an uncharacteristically generous mood.\u201d\n\nYou start to listen carefully.\n\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. When you get sentenced to Dreadcage, find a human there by the name of Ponyride\u2026and don\u2019t you dare laugh at the name. As silly as it might sound you don\u2019t want to know how he acquired it. Just ask any syndicate member where he is and they\u2019ll take you to him if you mention my name. It\u2019ll be real easy to find one of them since a lot of them are there and you just look for the tattoo.\u201d Mr. Scars says and juts out his shoulder.\n\u201cWhat will Ponyride do?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s gonna want proof you know me first, so tell him the phrase: The Duchess sure had a velvet throat. He\u2019ll know what it means.\u201d\n\nAs you take a moment to remember the phrase, Mr. Scars continues.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still blessed by Yag at this point, he\u2019ll honor the favor he owes me and give you a bit of protection for a while. Maybe a year at most. Should be more than enough time for you to get settled in and learn the routines without extra hassle. After that, you\u2019re going to be on your own. Now I\u2019m no recruiter, but I suggest that since you\u2019ll already be getting the benefits of Ebony Claw protection, you might want to get in good with us on a permanent basis, as it will potentially make the rest of your stay slightly less dangerous. I\u2019m sure Ponyride will have something for you to do, but that\u2019s on you and your choice.\u201d\n\nWell this isn\u2019t freedom, but at least it\u2019s a glimmer of hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I really don\u2019t know what to say\u2026I mean thank you of course, but why are you doing this? What\u2019s in it for you?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Nothing I guess, but I suppose I remember the first time I did some time in a prison. I was younger than you and it was a lesser offense, but it still wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and I know I would\u2019ve been glad for any help I could have gotten.\u201d\n\nThe cart and entourage of soldiers starts to slow down as you approach a large important looking white building with a lot of steps.\n\n\u201cThe thing is with my record, I know I\u2019m probably getting sentenced to be executed in a few months. There isn\u2019t really anything anyone can do for me, so I might as well call in the last favor I have left for someone that it will help. Use it or lose it as they say.\u201d Mr. Scars says.\n\u201c\u2026but still\u2026this is like a really big thing. I mean you barely know me and this is going to really help me out.\u201d You say still in disbelief of your luck.\n\u201cYeah, well make the most of it kid. Just out of curiosity though\u2026who did you supposedly kill?\u201d\n\u201cThe guy who stabbed my girlfriend... I had to run away from home after that.\u201d\n\u201cWell shit kid, that\u2019s more along the lines of justice as far as I can tell. Not sure if that really makes you a cold blooded killer at all, but I guess it\u2019s a good thing you know you can do it, if you have to right?\u201d\n\nAt this point the cart stops completely and the pair of you are taken out and marched to the white building. When you enter the pair of you are still together for a little while, but eventually the sergeant tells some of his men to take you down a different corridor to Judge Randal. He and the rest take Mr. Scars down another and you part company.\n\nWhen you get to Judge Randal, he sits behind his high desk and looks incredibly tired. You see him sentence various people before he finally gets to you.\n\nHe hears what you were charged with and just shakes his head.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Do you have anything to say in your defense?\u201d he asks.\n\nYou take a suggestion from what Mr. Scars said earlier and try to imply you\u2019re just a poor dumb kid that did something really stupid. The judge doesn\u2019t look impressed.\n\n\u201cUh huh. Listen, I hear that excuse all the time and sometimes its even true, but you were found with twenty vials of Blue Dream my boy. You didn\u2019t just stumble upon that, you\u2019re obviously working for someone bigger. Probably someone in the Ebony Claw Syndicate. If you\u2019re really sorry for what you\u2019ve done, then you\u2019re going to have to give me more than the baby in woods act.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re silent.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Twenty years at Dreadcage. Next.\u201d The judge remarks.\n\nYou are quickly taken away and soon marched back outside, but this time to a large enclosed wagon with several horses at the front. You\u2019re shoved inside and shackled to a few other prisoners. All of them are sizing you up and you do your best not to show any fear as the wagon door is closed and you\u2019re on your way to Dreadcage.\n\nThere is little light in the wagon, save for what\u2019s coming through the very small windows at the very top of it. Still, you manage to examine a few of the other prisoners and fortune strikes again when you see one with a black claw tattoo sitting across from you.\n\n\u201cYou Ebony Claw?\u201d you ask the man.\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s it to you pretty boy?\u201d he answers.\n\u201cMr. Scars wants you to take me to see Ponyride when we get to Dreadgate.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s eyes widen a bit when you mention Mr. Scars, but nods.\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d He answers.\n\nYou don\u2019t reach Dreadcage until nightfall, but when you finally reach it and exit the wagon, you can see that it definitely lives up to its name with the massive walls, towers and high fences.\n\nYou are then marched inside the prison where upon you and the rest are striped, hosed down, checked and given prison apparel. Your new \u201cname\u201d according to the prison is now 97P904.\n\nAfter this experience, you are shown your new cell. You cellmate is surprisingly a Halfling! Though within the first five minutes of meeting him he\u2019s quite firm about stating what is his and warns you that he\u2019s not going to tolerate any shit from the likes of you.\n\nYou maintain a respectful attitude and listen to his lecture, until your Claw \u201cliaison\u201d comes to find you.\n\n\u201cHey, Ponyride is ready to see you.\u201d He says which causes a bit of confusion from your cellmate who probably didn\u2019t expect you to have such connections. You get the impression his attitude towards you will be a lot different when you return.\n\nYou walk through the prison attempting to ignore the various threats and stares you\u2019re getting. You remember that you have to show absolutely no weakness or fear.\n\nSeveral ECS member congregate around Ponyride\u2019s cell. Ponyride himself is a muscular average sized man with a shaved head. He has several tattoos that in some way signify his allegiance to his organization.\n\nPonyride gets off his bed and approaches you with the usual hard stare that you\u2019re getting used to by everyone that has to prove how tough they are.\n\n\u201cSo, I hear you know Mr. Scars and he told you to speak with me. If that\u2019s true then you\u2019ll have something important to tell me. If not\u2026well you\u2019re going to get the privilege of learning exactly why they call me Ponyride.\u201d\n\nThis causes a few chuckles from Ponyride\u2019s cohorts, but you maintain your composure and simply utter the phrase.\n\n\u201cThe Duchess sure had a velvet throat.\u201d\n\nPonyride smiles and nods.\n\n\u201cI came enough to fill a fucking moat. Hah! Glad to see Mr. Scars remembers the good times. Alright, I dunno how he knows you, but if he trusted you enough to give you that phrase, then it\u2019s good enough for me. So I\u2019m guessing you want protection right?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Scars said a year\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\u201cA fucking year huh? Mr. Scars overestimates this favor I owe him. Ah, all right, what the hell, things are pretty peaceful right now I guess I can spare some. The Ebony Claw will make sure you\u2019re under our general protection, but remember, you ARE NOT one of us. That means if you severely fuck up or get in the way of our business, all bets are fucking off. Got me, pretty boy?\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cGood, and remember when a year is up you\u2019re on your fucking own. If you want anything from us after that, you gotta pay just like everyone else or join, but we can talk about that later if you so desire. Now leave me, I got important shit to do.\u201d\n\nYou are dismissed and the Claw member who took you to see Ponyride escorts you away and then leaves you to your own devices.\n\nWell you\u2019ve bought yourself a little time, now you have to get started learning everything you can about this place and deciding on how to spend your time here.\n\nBecause you sure have a lot of it.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Try to disarm Klint", "result": "While Klint is holding knife, you still doubt he\u2019s serious about killing you with it.

There was a fight and Klint attacked me and then Annah stabbed him and then I stabbed him and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh what the fuck, did you kill him?\u201d your father asks.\n\u201cYeah, I mean I\u2019m not sure, I suppose, but look I gotta get outta here!\u201d you say and push both of your parents out of the way to go gather a few things from your room.\n\nSurprisingly your father doesn\u2019t say much more, he just gathers up his emergency physician\u2019s bag and mutters to himself. You think you hear him saying how you\u2019re a fuck up before he leaves, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nYour mom on the other hand as you\u2019re hastily grabbing a few items, is tearfully going on about how you (And your sister) wasted your potential and she doesn\u2019t know where she and your father went wrong.\n\nYou have little time and it isn\u2019t much, but you try to reassure her that it isn\u2019t either of their faults. You\u2019d like to calm her down some more, but there are a bunch of people soon banging at the door.\n\n\u201cSTOP HIDING BEHIND YER MAMA\u2019S SKIRT AND GET OUT HERE MURDERER!\u201d you hear a voice shout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry for everything. I\u2026I gotta go.\u201d You say as you leave your mother crying and go to climb out your window.\n\nYou manage to just get out of your backyard when you hear someone else shout that they see you and you\u2019re soon off and running from a mob again.\n\nIt takes a bit of stealth and hiding on your part (along with distancing yourself from Teckleville) but eventually as the sky goes dark, you\u2019re fairly certain nobody from the town is still chasing you, or if they are, they might have made camp for the night.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019re in the middle of a wood, still wearing your bloody clothes (fortunately you managed to grab some spare in your pack though) unsure of where you\u2019re going to go exactly.\n\nOn top of it all you aren\u2019t sure what happened to Annah though knowing her she probably blamed you for everything. You\u2019re so tired. You can\u2019t even process all of it anymore. You have to rest.\n\nYou find a tree that looks sturdy and high enough, so you climb it and prepare to sleep for the night. You just hope that anyone that might still be looking for you at this late hour doesn\u2019t think to look up.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, your thoughts go to your sister.\n\n\u201cWell sis, whether things are working out for you or not right now, at least your exit wasn\u2019t like this.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Next Day", "result": "You wake up fairly early, but then you didn\u2019t really sleep much to begin with. This was more of a brief rest anyway.\n\nAfter a quick check to see if anyone is in the area, you get out of your bloody clothes and change into some new ones. You might not be properly clean, but it\u2019s better than you were.\n\nYou then check your supplies, which aren\u2019t much. You\u2019ve got a few coins, but you aren\u2019t excessively worried about that since food and water are more important out here in the wilderness. You\u2019ve got a little food and water, but it isn\u2019t going to last long. The only weapon you have currently is your dagger.\n\nAs you\u2019re checking your supplies, you hear the sound of something approaching you. Dread grips your body, you hide behind the nearest tree and you draw your dagger.\n\nYou take a quick peek and see that it\u2019s Annah stomping through the underbrush with the grace of a clumsy horse.\n\n\u201cShit, fucking thorns. Ouch!\u201d you hear her say and you come out of hiding.\n\u201cAnnah!\u201d you exclaim and walk over to her.\n\u201cThere you are! Y\u2019know, you could have warned me about leaving town, instead of making me trudge through the fucking woods looking for you!\u201d Annah snaps.\n\nOrnery as usual.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026how the hell did you even find me anyway?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDunno, I figured you\u2019d hide some place familiar. This is the area where we first did it so I took a chance.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cIt is?\u201d\n\nAnnah hits you.\n\n\u201cYes! By the gods, I can\u2019t believe you fucking forgot! In fact it was YOUR idea to go way the hell out here, I just wanted to do it over behind Derrick\u2019s barn where I first gave you a blowjob.\u201d\n\u201cWait. We were behind Derrick\u2019s barn during that?\u201d\n\nAnnah hits you again\n\n\u201cGlad to see all of our intimacy together meant so much to you. Asshole. I dunno why I even came out here to find you! Sorry we can\u2019t all be like your perfect sister. Bet you remember where you first fucked her!\u201d\n\nAt this point you stop Annah from hitting you again and try to maintain some control over this situation.\n\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I get it, I\u2019m an insensitive asshole, but you REALLY need to stop with these accusations of sister fucking especially when it isn\u2019t even true! Shit, I\u2019m not calling you a whore that sucked Klint\u2019s dick!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWHAT?! I did no such thing!\u201d Annah exclaims.\n\u201cWell he claimed you did before he attacked me.\u201d\n\u201cPfft. He wished. Look, I get that the dumb asses in town thought I was a whore, but Klint was repulsive\u2026besides he was always sniffing around your sister while she was still around. Never paid any attention to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell I figured he was just talking shit anyway\u2026(Sigh) anyway this is a mess. I\u2019m glad to see you escaped town though.\u201d\n\u201cEscaped? Nah, I just came out here to find you on my own. Don\u2019t worry, I made sure nobody was following me.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you didn\u2019t get in any trouble?\u201d\n\u201cNo. They all saw you kill Klint. I mean I did get asked questions, but I just said you and Klint got into a fight and you accidently killed him in the process. They didn\u2019t seem convinced that you killed him by accident though, so yeah they\u2019re still pissed at you.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re almost speechless right now.\n\n\u201cAre\u2026Are you fucking kidding me?! YOU were the one that stabbed him repeatedly in the back! I actually stopped YOU from killing Klint!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cYeah, and then you stabbed him in the throat and killed him. Why are you yelling at me?!\u201d Annah remarks.\n\nNow you can\u2019t even speak. You just rub your hands over your face and pace rapidly. In a strange way, you not even that mad at Annah. Everyone pretty much hated you anyway and Annah\u2019s actually just being herself.\n\nAnd that\u2019s so tragic that it causes you to laugh.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cThe absurdity of this horrible situation.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\n\u201cGood question. Can\u2019t stay out here in the wilderness.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh! Let\u2019s to Klyton!\u201d Annah says excitedly.\n\nWell that would be one option you were pondering.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly the closest city and it\u2019s the direction you ran from Teckleville anyway. The problem is if anyone from Teckleville is still searching for you, that\u2019s going to be the first place they look.\n\nStill, Klyton is the only place you really have any basic knowledge about thanks to your parents both being originally from there. Your father never really spoke too much about it, just saying that the only thing worthwhile that he got there was your mother and he was glad when they finally moved to Teckleville to be closer to your grandmother at the time.\n\nYour mother on the other hand didn\u2019t speak so ill of the place, which is surprising since she grew up in a lower class area than your father did. She even said that sometimes she missed the times when she worked at the inn where she met your father in the first place. Of course her knowledge about the city is bound to be a bit out of date.\n\nAlso, while Klyton has no jurisdiction over Teckleville, it has been known to apprehend wanted criminals from elsewhere trying to hide out there. Not to mention the place in general has a fairly good reputation (And they want to keep it that way) as far as its own security goes.\n\n\u201cWell we could also head to Holgard or the Delantium Kingdom, I think the closest city there is Sivak\u201d you say.\n\u201cNo! I want to go to Klyton! I\u2019ve never been there!\u201d Annah demands.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never been to the other places either!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, they\u2019re too far away, and we could run into bandits and you wouldn\u2019t be much help if they tried to gang rape me. I don\u2019t want to be out here any longer than I have to be.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know, YOU don\u2019t need to be out here at all considering you apparently threw me under the horse and cart and you\u2019re not even in any trouble for any of this!\u201d\n\nYou almost expect Annah to hit you again, but now she does something worse...she doesn\u2019t do it often, but\u2026\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d you say when you see her eyes starting to water.\n\u201cI knew it! You blame me for everything! You always blame me for everything that goes wrong! All I fucking did was try to help you when Klint was kicking your ass too! (Sob!) You\u2019re right, I DON\u2019T have to be out here, but I\u2019m out here because I fucking love you okay? (Sob!) I don\u2019t even know why, because you\u2019re a fucking ungrateful asshole!\u201d Annah cries and then runs off to a nearby tree to continue sobbing.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Damn it\u2026.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nWhile you\u2019re questioning the idea that this is even a good idea, the fact remains is that in Annah\u2019s strange way she is here for you right now. In fact, she\u2019s possibly the ONLY person on your side right now.\n\nSo for better or worse you\u2019ll put up with her. (For now)\n\n\u201cAnnah\u2026.look, I\u2019m sorry about my tone okay? But you gotta understand I\u2019m trying to deal with all this shit and I can hardly think right now. I mean I didn\u2019t even think I was going to see you again. I\u2019m also worried about my parents. I mean yeah I didn\u2019t get along with them, but they certainly don\u2019t deserve the shitstorm they\u2019re probably going through with the rest of the town right now. I mean what about your mom? You don\u2019t think she\u2019s wondering where you are right now?\u201d you say while rubbing her shoulders\n\u201c(Sniffle) Have you met my mom? She probably doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m gone yet. Hell, she probably doesn\u2019t even know everything that happened yesterday.\u201d Annah says turning around and wiping her eyes.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so, she is drunk a lot of the time. But anyway, like I said, I\u2019m trying to process the fact that I\u2019m now wanted for murder. I don\u2019t even know how I feel on THAT fact either. The actual murder. I mean I feel like maybe I should feel bad or something.\u201d\n\u201cBad? Why would you feel bad? Klint was an asshole, I\u2019m certainly not upset over it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026yeah I suppose I\u2019m not either and it was mostly in self-defense and an accident despite what everyone in town says. Still though, makes me wonder if I\u2019m capable of killing again.\u201d\n\u201cI sure hope so, because it\u2019s dangerous out here! Is that dagger the only weapon you got?\u201d\n\u201cHm? Yeah. Apologies, but I didn\u2019t exactly have time to buy a sword on my way out of town.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, I guess it will have to do. Just hope we don\u2019t run into anything bigger than a hungry rat.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the weapon, it\u2019s how you use it.\u201d\n\u201cYes dear, you keep telling yourself that\u2026so are we going to Klyton now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to Klyton\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah makes \u201cSqueee!\u201d sound and then kisses you saying how exciting it will be to finally go to the \u201cBig City.\u201d\n\nHonestly, you think Annah\u2019s enthusiasm to go to Klyton is a little misplaced even if she wasn\u2019t travelling with a wanted murderer. At least she isn\u2019t bitching anymore though.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t last and she inevitably starts complaining when you insist on staying off the road and sticking to the woods to keep out of sight of any potential person from Teckleville that might be tracking you.\n\n\u201cDunno why you think this makes you more hidden. I found you in the woods.\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cYeah, well not everyone has the magical ability to find me like you do, now come on and keep it down!\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou know there are blood stalkers out here and bandits who\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWill try to rape you. Yes, I know. You\u2019ve only mentioned that three or four times already. What is your preoccupation with getting raped?\u201d\n\u201cYou saying that wouldn\u2019t happen?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026I\u2026agh! Look it\u2019s getting dark enough that I can barely see shit in front of me and we probably should just stop for the rest of the night. I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a suitable tree to sleep in\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA tree? I\u2019m not sleeping in a tree! It sounds uncomfortable and I could fall out and break my neck!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s safer than you think, you just prop yourself up against the trunk and a large enough branch. It\u2019ll actually be safer than sleeping on the ground. Up in a tree we can at least\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in a fucking tree! I\u2019m hungry, and it\u2019s getting cold! We should build a fire!\u201d\n\nYou face palm at your situation. The tree thing you\u2019re flexible on, but a fire? That\u2019s potentially asking for trouble. Still, if you make a fire, you\u2019ll hopefully shut Annah up.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make a fire", "result": "Honestly, if anything Annah\u2019s loud bitching is going to attract more attention to your position than a fire at this point.\n\n\u201cAlright! Alright! Just stop! We\u2019ll build a damn fire. I think I got a tinderbox, never used it though since I didn\u2019t exactly spend nights out in the wilderness, so you\u2019re going to have to bear with me.\u201d\n\nYou gather up a bunch of broken branches, break out your tinderbox and begin fumbling around with the flint\n\n\u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, this isn\u2019t sex. I figured this would be a simple enough task, even for you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, Annah. I told you I wasn\u2019t an expert at doing this but feel free to help me if you know how!\u201d You answer throwing the flint down.\n\u201cSo I guess it is sex. (sigh) Move!\u201d Annah remarks and takes over.\n\nAnd of course she does it nearly instantly and you soon have a fire going. You\u2019re getting incredibly angry and starting to regret letting her tag along now. You\u2019re under enough pressure as it is and you can\u2019t deal with her attitude right now.\n\n\u201cHey I said I was also hungry, didn\u2019t you bring any food?\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cYou want food? You want fucking food? HERE! Take it! Take everything I fucking have!\u201d you shout as you pull out apples from your bag and start throwing them at her.\n\u201cHEY! STOP! Stop you fucking asshole!\u201d she replies dodging apples.\n\u201cI oughta do worse than throw fucking apples at you!\u201d\n\u201cOh like what? You gonna stab and kill me too?\u201d Annah asks while picking up a nearby apple.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d\n\u201cThreats of violence. Nice. I can\u2019t believe I recently cried over you.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you even meant it. Y\u2019know before all this shit went down, I was actually thinking about breaking up with you in the first place. And guess what, I was right about\u2026\u201d\n\nYour words are interrupted by a flying apple. You dodge it and Annah\u2019s eyes go a bit wide when she sees you come at her.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get far when you tackle her to the ground. After a bit of struggling you manage to subdue her, by getting on top of her and holding her wrists down. You\u2019re breathing heavy and have a nasty look in your eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to do that! You know how I get! Please just don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d Annah begs and starts to tear up again.\n\nDespite your rather aggressive dominance over Annah, you weren\u2019t actually planning to do anything except scare her really bad, which you definitely succeeded in doing. Any ideas of battery, torture, murder or (as Annah usually believes), rape weren\u2019t in the equation.\n\nUnfortunately nobody else saw it that way. And between the fire AND your very loud arguing and fighting with Annah, someone came to investigate.\n\nYou suddenly feel a crushing blow to the back of your head and you crumple on top of Annah\u2019s body. You have a little strength left to push yourself up a bit, but another blow succeeds in knocking you out.\n\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself in a cell, which look very familiar. It should, because you\u2019ve been in it before. You\u2019re at the Teckleville jail.\n\n\u201cWell, looks like the Teckleville Terror is finally up and from here on your ass belongs to me until your execution.\u201d A familiar voice remarks.\n\nIt\u2019s Sheriff Walford. Just one of your many admirers. You sit up from the floor and rub your head.\n\n\u201c(Groan) I knew lighting that fire was a bad idea.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just full of them boy and you\u2019ll be paying for them soon because your luck has finally run out.\u201d Walford says from his desk\n\u201cSurprised you just didn\u2019t tell your men to kill me on sight.\u201d\n\u201cOh trust me, when they caught you tryin\u2019 to rape that girl, they wanted to, but I specifically told them to bring you in alive no matter what the circumstances. Because I personally want to see you hang.\u201d\n\u201cHow law abiding of you. (Sigh) I don\u2019t suppose it would help if I said Annah\u2019s lying about that.\u201d\n\u201cLyin that you WEREN\u2019T tryin ta rape her? Pfft, already know that son.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you tellin\u2019 me that Annah didn\u2019t accuse me of rape?\u201d\n\u201cNo she didn\u2019t for some strange reason. She claims you and her were just having an argument, but my boys said it sure as hell didn\u2019t look like that to them. Dunno what spell you got that girl under, but it ain\u2019t gonna save your ass because you\u2019re STILL wanted for the murder of Klint! You were fortunate that his father didn\u2019t catch you before my men did though I wouldn\u2019t have minded if he had.\u201d\n\nWow, that\u2019s a bit surprising about Annah. She knows you better than you thought AND she\u2019s still trying in her own way to defend you.\n\nThe sheriff goes on to say that she isn\u2019t the only one either. Apparently your father has hired the best freelance advocate he could find in Klyton. While it\u2019s a pretty grim conclusion that you\u2019re going to be found guilty, your father made so much of a stink that he demanded that you at least get a trial of sorts.\n\nIt would appear you have more people on your side than you thought\n\nA few days pass and Annah tries to see you, but they won\u2019t let her in. Your parents won\u2019t be denied however and of course your expensive advocate speaks to you as well to get all your information.\n\nThe day finally comes and you\u2019re trotted out before practically the whole town, most of which are already booing and calling for your blood. The town mayor is overseeing this trial and going to make the final decision. While you\u2019ve never directly done any wrong to him, he doesn\u2019t particularly like you so in your mind you might as well be going to the noose already.\n\nStill, you don\u2019t give up. You don\u2019t actually speak in your own trial, your advocate speaks for you and does a WAY better job than you ever could. Annah and your parents both testify on your behalf, and even a few people begrudgingly admit that they saw the entire fight with Klint and say you didn\u2019t really mean to kill him. You really wish your sister was around because you imagine that she would be able to charm a few more folks to your side.\n\nOf course the other side paints you out to be evil incarnate whenever they can. Klint\u2019s parents in particular.\n\nEventually the mayor says he\u2019s heard enough and that\u2019s when you think here comes the execution sentence.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) As long as I\u2019ve been mayor, this young man has been a blight on this town despite his father and mother being good people. I can\u2019t fault them for defending him because above all else he is their son. But another son was killed and that\u2019s the main reason we\u2019re here today. The rape accusation\u2026well quite frankly the young girl denies that it happened and if she\u2019s deluded enough to defend her abusive criminal boyfriend\u2026well I just shake my head in dismay and nothing else. Given her own shady reputation, I\u2019m actually inclined they just enjoy a sick relationship.\u201d\n\nThe mayor continues.\n\n\u201cBut getting back to the murder. While tragic, I have to weigh all arguments. We all know that Klint himself was no angel. I\u2019m sorry to say that in front of his parents, but it\u2019s true. This was a case of the stupid antics of youth getting way out of hand. And as much as I dislike this budding criminal in front of me, I truly don\u2019t believe he killed Klint out of malice.\n\nAt this point several people start booing again until the mayor calls for order.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough! I\u2019m mayor of this damn town and this is my decision which I haven\u2019t even got to yet! My verdict is guilty BUT I\u2019m not giving this young man death. It was an accident and despite everything I\u2019ve said, I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with myself executing a youth who made a very bad mistake. However, he can\u2019t stay here. So my final decision is exile as of tomorrow. You come back and you WILL be executed, you understand?\u201d the mayor says.\n\u201cI understand, sir and I thank you for your fair judgment.\u201d You reply and nod.\n\u201cTake him back to his cell, release him in the morning.\u201d\n\nThe crowd goes nuts at this decision and the Teckleville Watch barely manage to get you back to the jail unscathed. After throwing you back in your cell, Sheriff Walford flips his desk over as his men standby.\n\n\u201cAre you secretly a son of Yag or just permanently blessed by him? Because there is no way one person can be so fucking lucky!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck sheriff, it was justice. Look on the bright side, I won\u2019t be here to bother you anymore\u2026which is what I was trying to do in the first place before you dragged me back here.\u201d You say.\n\nThe sheriff is so flustered he can\u2019t even be bothered to yell at you anymore. He just says you\u2019re going to get yours and soon before leaving.\n\nYou secretly smirk at things going your way for a change and lay down thinking about what you\u2019re going to do with your new exiled life tomorrow. Probably the same thing you were going to do before, except without Annah tagging along. Sure, she helped you out, but you can see that relationship is just doomed to cause more problems than you need. (Like this incident!)\n\nEventually you go to sleep figuring you\u2019re going to need your energy for traveling tomorrow.\n\nIn the middle of the night you suddenly hear your cell door open and you groggily wake up.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2019s going on\u2026is it morning all\u2026ULP!\u201d you utter.\n\u201cFor my son, you murdering bastard!\u201d you hear a deep voice say as a large figure rushes in your cell on top of you and you feel a blade go into your throat.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "No compromise", "result": "Enough is enough.\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up already and stop being a bitch! Shit!\u201d you yell.\n\u201cBitch? You fucking shithead, why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Annah starts to say before you interrupt\n\u201cNO! I\u2019m not fucking finished! You\u2019re gonna listen for a damn change, and don\u2019t think your crying routine is going to work again, because I\u2019m too pissed right now! Look, this is how it\u2019s gonna be\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah surprisingly (and reluctantly) shuts up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sleep on the ground, but we\u2019re not starting a damn fire! Last thing we need to attract possible attention of Teckleville locals looking for me, or monsters or bandits\u2026you know the ones that apparently just love to rape you in every scenario? If you\u2019re cold, well you\u2019ll just have to be satisfied with my body heat and cuddle up against me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou hate cuddling. You always say it feels like you\u2019re being confined.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cYeah, well I hate a lot of things right now, but I\u2019m willing to make that sacrifice. Now I didn\u2019t address this before, but did you even pack anything useful with you, I notice you\u2019re travelling kind of light.\u201d\n\u201cI have some money.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. I suppose that will come in useful when we finally get to Klyton. (Sigh) Okay, I brought some food, mostly fruit, and water, so I guess you can have some of that. Don\u2019t eat and drink all of it though\u2026and before you even start, NO I\u2019m not implying anything about your damn weight. I just don\u2019t know how much further it is to Klyton.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you? What are you going to eat?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just one more sacrifice I guess. Really I\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s just\u2026let\u2019s just try not to fight much more okay? I\u2019m under a lot of stress right now and it\u2019s not helping either of us. I know I sound at this moment, but deep down for some fucked up reason I\u2019m actually glad you\u2019re here. At least I know you care.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly you think you might have gotten through to Annah this time, as she quietly nods her head instead of her usual routine of talking back. She then goes to hug you, which you return.\n\nThe remainder of the night is pretty quiet in fact. You\u2019re still half paranoid about someone sneaking up on you both, but you never even hear anything out of the ordinary.\n\nPredictably Annah does indeed cuddle up next to you during the night. While she sleeps fairly sound, you remain in a half sleep state and waking up periodically.\n\nYou\u2019ll be glad when you get to Klyton.\n\nThe next day is fairly mundane until you notice that the woods is beginning to thin out. If you continue walking the way you are going, you\u2019re going to be in the open fields. and if you\u2019re going to march across the open plains, you might as well just walk on the road since you\u2019ll be just as exposed.\n\n\u201cWell, looks like no more hiding in the trees.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cLooks like. If I was by myself, I\u2019d probably just rest up here at the edge of these woods and walk through the night so as to continue the low profile\u2026but since I know you\u2019re pretty eager to get the hell out of nature\u2019s embrace, we\u2019ll continue along.\u201d\n\u201cWe travelling through those fields?\u201d\n\u201cNah, if we\u2019re going to march across the open fields, we might as well just walk on the road since we\u2019ll be just as exposed either way. The road will be easier to traverse as well since that grass looks like it gets knee high.\u201d\n\nYou and Annah make your way back towards the road and now you\u2019re looking around more than ever. You continue to keep aware of your surroundings by keeping an ear out for various sounds. You still have this idea that you\u2019re suddenly going to hear Teckleville watchmen on horses galloping on your position.\n\n\u201cWill you please stop acting so nervous? I doubt if anyone from home is even looking for you anymore and if they are, I hardly think they\u2019re going to go all the way to Klyton. It wasn\u2019t like you killed the blacksmith, it was just Klint.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cYeah well you still aren\u2019t the one that\u2019s potentially going to hang.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo you keep telling me. Look I think you know I\u2019m just as nervous for other reasons being out here, but I\u2019m trying to stay calm because\u2026well you\u2019re with me and I know you\u2019ll protect me.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said I wouldn\u2019t be much help with my little dagger.\u201d\n\u201cI admit I spoke too harshly. I\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019d probably kill enough of them giving me a chance to run before they cut you down.\u201d\n\nYou start to laugh.\n\n\u201cHey, what about helping me like you did with Klint?\u201d you chuckle.\n\u201cYeah, I guess I could try\u2026we\u2019ll see how it goes when the time comes. But until then, you acting all jittery and anxious is making me feel the same way, so I\u2019d like it if you could take it down a bit\u2026shit what are those?\u201d Annah says pointing ahead.\n\nYou see what Annah is talking about. It\u2019s a hanging cage along side the road.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of those before. Klyton apparently uses them when the jails are full and the criminal hasn\u2019t done anything bad enough to deserve outright death. So they get put in these cages until they eventually die of starvation, exposure or someone grants the mercy of killing them. Either way they aren\u2019t the city\u2019s problem anymore. Seems like it would be kinder to kill them immediately.\n\n\u201cWell at least we know we\u2019re getting pretty close to the city. Besides, if there is anyone inside, they\u2019re going to be locked up in the cages. Just stay away from grabbing reach.\u201d You say.\n\nFirst couple cages you pass are empty. The next one has a decaying smell as you pass, but nobody is in it. You notice on the other side of the road a couple of the cages have bodies in them, but seeing as they aren\u2019t moving, you can only guess you\u2019re probably walking by corpses.\n\nAt least you think you are.\n\n\u201cHey, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have any extra water would you?\u201d you suddenly hear one of the slumping figures in the cage say.\n\nBefore you can even answer, Annah speaks up.\n\n\u201cNo, and even if we did, we wouldn\u2019t waste it on a dead man.\u201d Annah snaps.\n\u201cOkay, it was just a question. Sheesh\u2026that\u2019s some girl you got there son. Good luck to ya with that one.\u201d The man says in a way that sounds sympathic.\n\nYou and Annah press on past the cages. Eventually Klyton is in sight and you both quicken your pace, anxious to get to your destination as night has now fallen.\n\nWhen you get to the city gates, you find them to be heavily guarded and you\u2019re stopped.\n\n\u201cHalt, you two don\u2019t look like merchants or anyone else that has a real job. In fact you both look a bit suspicious sneaking about the city at this time of night.\u201d One of the guards says.\n\u201cSneaking around? But we\u2019re going through the main gate!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou giving me lip boy? I\u2019m asking the questions here! We don\u2019t need anymore scum like you in this city!\u201d the guard says and pushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re smart enough not to start a fight with an armored guard, but you\u2019re starting to wonder if you\u2019re going to even get in the city.\n\n\u201cPlease sir, we just want to get within the safety of the city. It\u2019s night and we don\u2019t want to get accosted by monsters or bandits that plague the countryside.\u201d Annah says in a pleading voice.\n\u201cHmph! Shoulda thought about that before you left wherever it is you came from!\u201d the guard says.\n\u201cIndeed we wouldn\u2019t have risked leaving our small town sir, but\u2026well you see we are in love and our parents didn\u2019t approve. We had no choice but to flee and get married elsewhere. Klyton was the closest and safest place.\u201d\n\u201cDisobedient to your parents huh? Now I know you\u2019re not fit for this city!\u201d\n\nAnnah at this point gets closer to the guard as she spins this tale.\n\n\u201cI know we just look like delinquent ragamuffins to you, but we\u2019re just young and lacking options. We\u2019re just simple folks in the scheme of things and we can\u2019t help how we appear right now or how we feel about each other. Yes, we don\u2019t have much money, but my beloved is skilled in the blacksmithing trade. He\u2019s even willing to work as a dung sweeper if he can\u2019t get an apprenticeship and I fully intend on trying to get work as a waitress.\u201d\n\nAnnah goes back to your side and holds your hand .\n\n\u201cAll we want to do is start a new life and family together here. Would you really deny us entry when the only thing we\u2019re guilty of is being young and in love?\u201d She says and then kisses you on the cheek.\n\nAt this point the guard Annah\u2019s been speaking to, wipes his eye. He then puts a hand in his pocket.\n\n\u201c(sniffle) Here. Take this. Think of it as a wedding gift.\u201d He says and hands you a few silvers which you take.\n\n\u201cThank you sir.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Go inside. (Sniffle) I\u2019m not sure which gods you two worship, but there is a church of Joachim the Pure that\u2019s open all the time. You can probably get married there right now. It\u2019s just two rights and a left from where you go past the city gates. You can also find a cheap inn in the same area. You should have enough.\u201d The guard says still trying to keep it together.\n\nAs you pass the guard, Annah thanks him and says that you\u2019ll both say a prayer in Joachim\u2019s name for his kindness.\n\nWhen you both get past the city gates and far enough away, you finally say something.\n\n\u201cOkay, THAT was some of your best work. Shit, even I was starting to get a little choked up.\u201d You say smiling.\n\u201cThink so? Thanks! If everyone here is as much of a soft sell as that guard, we\u2019re going to clean up.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully. Well we\u2019re finally here. Definitely bigger than I thought, we probably can get better bearings of this place tomorrow during the day. So you want to go find that inn the guard mentioned?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean spend the night together? Why how improper! We aren\u2019t even married!\u201d Annah laughs.\n\nYou laugh too as the pair of you go seek a room for the night.\n\nWell, you\u2019re in a big city now. All you have to do now is figure out how to thrive here.\n\nYour mind races with a list of things you have to do. Even with Annah by your side, it\u2019s still going to be overwhelming at first, but you still have hope that you\u2019ll be able to find the fortune and purpose here that you weren\u2019t going to find in Teckleville.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 2E: Partners In Crime\n\n\nYear 17\n\n\u201cAnnah, I know how to pick a fucking lock, will you stop bitching? This is for your benefit. Are you even paying attention?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fucking paying attention. I\u2019m just getting bored and you\u2019re taking too fucking long. If I wanted that experience I\u2019d just suck your dick.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cHa fucking ha. There. Got it.\u201d\n\u201cFinally. Hey you asshole! Why the hell did you slap my hand?\u201d Annah says, hitting you back.\n\u201cBecause if you were paying attention, you\u2019d see there\u2019s a blade trap almost well hidden in the roof of the safe. Had I not been here, you\u2019d be giving me hand jobs with your left hand rather than your right in your foreseeable future.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting ANY sort of job if you continue to abuse me!\u201d\n\u201cContinue to\u2026nevermind. Let me just disarm this and we can get the fuck out of here. And pay attention to what I\u2019m doing!\u201d\n\nSo much for Annah changing when she got to Klyton. You sometimes think you\u2019ve gotten to her and she\u2019ll stop bitching so much, but it\u2019s always just temporary. You really miss working with your sister.\n\nWhile Annah has certainly improved some of her skills she\u2019s ultimately just too damn impatient and lazy for all this and despite her bitching about being the \u201cdistraction\u201d during some of your jobs, she relies on it a lot.\n\nYou figured showing her the more practical and direct aspects of the job, she\u2019d be more appreciative, but this character flaw of bitching non-stop is making you rethink this too.\n\nYou get the strong impression that she\u2019d rather not help you at all and just would rather reap the benefits. Which at this point might at least be easier on you since you\u2019d be able to work in peace, though if that was the case, why the hell would you need to give her any of it? You\u2019d be better off alone and keep everything.\n\nAfter swiftly disarming the trap, you grab the valuables inside which consists mainly of gold coins and couple pieces of expensive looking jewelry. Not a bad haul. Annah picked a good home to break into even if you would have liked a little more time to case the place first.\n\nHaving gotten your loot, the pair of you leave as fast as possible. You both stop temporarily just before you get back to your neighborhood.\n\n\u201cHold on, let\u2019s be careful. Don\u2019t really feel like stumbling into any Bloody Talons right now, especially with this stash.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI thought they were the Crimson Talons.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cI dunno, I think that was their old name. Heard something about a change in leadership and apparently the new leader is some sort of psycho. Nearly got into it with a few of them two days ago saying that I better not be working on their turf. Which apparently is practically most of the city according to them.\u201d\n\u201cWell if we moved to a better neighborhood, we wouldn\u2019t have to sneak about like this and I don\u2019t like living at the Welcome Mat, there are a bunch of whores, drunks, and dregs of the city that live there.\u201d\n\u201cThe Welcome Mat is a shitty place I agree, but we\u2019re less likely to draw attention there. I mean we\u2019re a young couple with no visible means of support. Granted the asshole who runs the place is always bitching about his rent, but given that he\u2019s selling booze without a license in his basement and got whores living in his hotel he\u2019s not likely to turn us in. I mean there is also the militia to worry about and it feels like they\u2019ve been increasing their own patrols in response to the Bloody Talons.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, nobody is going to care what we might be doing as long as we\u2019re paying the coin to live wherever we\u2019re choosing to live at and dressing the part\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I prefer that we also save a little of our coin because, who knows when we might need it for a bribe or to get the hell out of Klyton one day.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of stealing shit, if we\u2019re not going to have fun with it?! I\u2019m tired of eating low class food and never getting to wear any of the shinies we take. If I wanted that life, I would have stayed in Teckleville.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll talk about this later when we\u2019re not out in the open potentially\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell what do we have here?\u201d A voice exclaims.\n\nYou and Annah both turn around to see three men bigger than you. Not by much, but certain enough that three of them are more than you\u2019d be able to handle with just a short sword. In fact you recognize them as the ones that you were just telling Annah about.\n\n\u201cHey, I know you! You\u2019re that shithead we spoke to earlier this week about not working on our turf. What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d one of them says recognizing you as well.\n\u201cNot working on your turf obviously. I\u2019m not doing anything except\u2026going off with this whore.\u201d You say\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Annah exclaims completely fucking up your excuse.\n\u201cHey paid your price, I\u2019m not giving you another coin!\u201d you remark trying to salvage the situation, but Annah is being uncooperative tonight.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking whore, I had enough of being called that in Teckleville! And I\u2019m not going to pretend to be one, just because you\u2019re scared of these three assholes.\u201d\n\nThe two Bloody Talons are more amused than angry, but they haven\u2019t lost interest.\n\n\u201cNice try shithead. Now obviously since you tried to fucking lie to us, you HAVE been working on our turf. However, hand over what\u2019s in your pack now and you and your stupid bitch MIGHT walk away unscathed.\u201d The talkative one says.\n\u201cStupid bitch? You\u2019re the ones in a dumb ass gang probably giving half of your shit to your boss. I\u2019d say you\u2019re the stupid bitches here.\u201d Annah replies.\n\nGoing to be one of those nights\u2026\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t beat the shit out of you AFTER I\u2019m done beating the shit out of your boyfriend here, you mouthy bitch.\u201d the talkative Talon warns.\n\u201cOh I can think of better things to do with her mouth.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cYeah\u2026you might be right. Maybe we\u2019ll be taking something else along with what\u2019s in your pack.\u201d\n\u201cYou fuckers and your Halfling dicks aren\u2019t going to do shit! Now get the fuck out of here, before my boyfriend pulls out his pistol!\u201d\n\nYou have no firearm of any kind, but unlike Annah, you know when to take advantage of a cue. So you immediately reach into your clothing, which causes the Bloody Talons to immediately run from your position like idiots.\n\nWhich is when you take the opportunity to grab Annah\u2019s hand and run the hell out of there as fast as you can.\n\n\u201cHEY HE DOESN\u2019T HAVE A GUN!\u201d you hear one of the geniuses shout, but you and Annah don\u2019t look back or stop until you get to the safety of the Welcome Mat and even then you go straight to your room.\n\nYou lock the door immediately and then you finally speak.\n\n\u201cAnnah, what the fuck is wrong with you?! We could have been killed!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI know, that\u2019s why I got us out of that situation by bluffing that you had a gun. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be grateful that I\u2019m so quick on my feet.\u201d\n\nYou nearly have no words\u2026\n\n\u201cGrateful?! I could have gotten us out of that situation a lot easier if you\u2019d just gone along with the whore story!\u201d you say.\n\u201cAnd I said I\u2019m not a fucking whore and I\u2019m not going to pretend to be one either! Besides, they weren\u2019t buying that story anyway. My way worked!\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cYeah, and what if they had been a little braver and called the bluff OR shit, one of them had a flintlock of their own?\u201d\n\u201cPfft, they\u2019re cowardly gutter scum at heart that\u2019s why they rove in packs and are part of a bullshit gang and did you see how they were dressed? Fucking rags, no way they could even afford a firearm.\u201d\n\nYou might as well be talking to a brick wall.\n\nWhile you\u2019re trying not to get frothing mad and think of a calm way to explain that now thanks to Annah, you definitely will have the Bloody Talons on your asses, Annah has moved on to taking your pack and emptying the contents on the bed and going through them.\n\nYou notice she\u2019s putting aside a lot of the contents next to herself.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my share. I figure since I saved our asses tonight, that entitles me to a lot more.\u201d\n\u201cSaved our asses? I repeat, you nearly got us fucking killed! And on top of that, I had to prevent you from getting your hand chopped off because you were trying to grab shit before checking for traps!\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to have nice things?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to have nice things! You don\u2019t want me to try to improve my self. You want to keep me dressed in rags, looking like shit and generally being miserable.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, okay THAT is not even true. I don\u2019t have any control over how you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you afraid if I start feeling good about myself I\u2019ll start looking for someone better?\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just being melodramatic and ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there you go dismissing my feelings again!\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, if you\u2019re so unhappy and dissatisfied with me, then why are you still around? I mean I\u2019m not twisting your arm and holding you here.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m an inconvenience to you? I\u2019m starting to wonder if you really love me at all.\u201d\n\nYou think about your next words and the possible consequences, but then you do it anyway, because you\u2019ve had it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder too, given all the shit you put me through on a daily basis!\u201d\n\nAnnah\u2019s eyes widen.\n\n\u201cBe very careful with your next words to me.\u201d Annah warns.\n\u201cFuck that, I\u2019ve tried everything with you and nothing fucking works! You are content on just berating me day in day out! When you aren\u2019t bitching about what I\u2019m doing, you\u2019re finding new stuff to nag me about! I thought maybe things would be different here between us, but I guess not. So since you can\u2019t seem to let go, I\u2019ll do all the work as usual\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point you start grabbing all the loot on the bed and putting it into a nearby bag. Then you go to where you keep your \u201csavings\u201d and take some of that out and throw that into the bag as well. You then thrust the bag of valuables into Annah\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what are you doing?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cGiving you what you obviously need. Hope you find someone better.\u201d You say and start pushing Annah towards the door who is resisting the whole time.\n\u201cHey! Tha\u2026That\u2019s it? Just like that and you\u2019re just fucking kicking me out?! What about the rest of my clothes and belongings?!\u201d\n\u201cYou got more than enough coin to buy all the nice things you ever wanted, and I know you have just enough skill to get by. It\u2019s been fun and I\u2019ll always remember the good times. Bye Annah.\u201d You say and you shove Annah out the door.\n\nYou expect Annah to bang on the door or at least yell at you, maybe even cry, but that doesn\u2019t happen. You just hear her footsteps walking off.\n\nThings between the two of you were always volatile, probably for the best that this ended now. You always thought it would Annah that would eventually leave though; you guess maybe she just needed a little extra shove.\n\nWithout much else to do and this being a bit of an exhausting event, you go to sleep. When you wake up its midday and feeling refreshed.\n\n\u201cAnnah, are you\u2026oh right.\u201d You say remembering she\u2019s not here, which still seems odd. You sort of figured that maybe she\u2019d sneak back in or something.\n\nGoing to be a little weird without her around you think, but life goes on. After all you didn\u2019t expect her to come with you in the first place.\n\nYou move on to pondering what your plans are today. While you gave most of the stash to Annah, you can easily live on what you have left for a month before you even need to go out again.\n\nYou figure you\u2019ll ponder your long-term goals after getting something to eat. You take some of your coin and exit your room.\n\nAs you\u2019re trying to leave the inn, you bump into Randi, the red headed whore that lives in the building. Better than that drunk Joachim priest Virgil asking for a donation again you suppose.\n\n\u201cHey handsome, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks a bit flirtatiously.\n\u201cNothing, just going to get some food.\u201d you reply.\n\u201cI see. Where\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d\n\u201cHell if I know, we\u2019re not together any more.\u201d\n\u201cIs that right? Well, you looking for some company then?\u201d\n\u201cEh, I wasn\u2019t planning on it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, let me satisfy your other appetites. I\u2019ll even give you a discount for your broken heart.\u201d Randi says thrusting her chest out and moving in closer to you.\n\nYou look at Randi who, as far as whores go isn\u2019t exactly top tier, though it looks like she\u2019s put a little more effort into her job today.\n\nNormally you probably wouldn\u2019t give Randi a second look, but it\u2019s not like you have anything better to do and she\u2019s probably going to be cheaper than a girl at an established brothel.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Randi", "result": "What the hell, moving on is all part of the healing process.\n\n\u201cOkay Randi, let\u2019s go.\u201d You say.\n\nYou go off with Randi back to her room where you have\u2026an interesting time.\n\nActually interesting is an understatement. While you really only have Annah to compare her to, you soon learn why Randi keeps in steady business despite not necessarily being the best looking of whores.\n\nAfterwards you spend some of the day seeking out new burglary opportunities, though since you\u2019re a lot lower on coin due to spending some of it on Randi earlier, you engage in a little more pick pocketing.\n\nA couple days pass and you have a burning sensation the next time you piss.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d You exclaim and realize that Randi has left you a reminder of your good time with her. You really should have known better you suppose, but you\u2019re still angry. And you don\u2019t feel any less angry when you bump into her in the hallway.\n\n\u201cHey handsome, you interested in another date with me? I\u2019ll even give you another discount, you look like you\u2019re still in pain.\u201d Randi says.\n\u201cPain? Shit yeah I\u2019m in pain. You fucking gave me crotch rot you dumb whore!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh I did not. You probably just got the burn. Just go to the apothecary and get yourself the antidote. That\u2019s what other people do.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if you\u2019d warned me ahead of time it wouldn\u2019t be fucking necessary!\u201d\n\u201cI find that when I tell people they change their mind. People are so judgmental about that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI fucking wonder why, get the hell out of my way disease bag!\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck you. I didn\u2019t hear you complaining a few days ago!\u201d\n\nYou walk past Randi and make a quick trip to the nearest apothecary.\n\nJust your luck, you get there and there\u2019s a long line. Probably all there to get cured from the shit they caught from Randi.\n\nYou wait for a few hours and the line never seems to move which makes sense since there\u2019s only one healer and his assistant working. By the time you start to get closer, the assistant decides to tell everyone that they\u2019re closing for the day.\n\nWhile this seems to come to no surprise to some of the people, and others grumble a bit, but you\u2019re one of the few that begins yelling loudly.\n\n\u201cWhat!? I\u2019ve been waiting fucking hours!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cApologies sir, but my master is not taking any more business today, he needs to rest like everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cWell wake him the fuck up! I got a case of dick fire over here and I need the fucking cure!\u201d\n\u201cSir. I understand your issues. Look, if you come here first thing in the morning, you can be one of the first to get served.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the name of the medicine I need?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me sir?\u201d\n\u201cThe medicine! What do I need exactly to cure my fucking dick?\u201d\n\nThe assistant is a little bewildered by your question, but he answers you and even tells you what it looks like when you ask. You then thank him and leave.\n\nThe shop closes and you go back to the Welcome Mat (and shoving Virgil aside when he predictably asks you for coin as usual).\n\nYou wait until the middle of the night and then make your way back to the apothecary, which you easily break into.\n\nAfter a bit of searching you find the medicine you\u2019re looking for and immediately down the stuff. It\u2019s foul, but hopefully it works as intended. Just in case, you grab several more bottles of the stuff.\n\nFeeling mildly more relieved of your situation; you exit the shop with the intent of heading back home.\n\nAnd then you feel a fist to the side of your face.\n\nThis is then followed by a few kicks and then two people picking you up.\n\n\u201cSo, not working our turf huh? What the hell you doing breaking into a place we\u2019re protecting? Where\u2019s yer gun at? Oh right, you don\u2019t have one\u201d a man says while searching you and taking away your weapons.\n\u201cHell, where\u2019s his mouthy bitch at? Still would like to shut her up.\u201d One of the men holding you up says.\n\nYou can only see out one eye and its dark, but you know immediately that these are the same Bloody Talons you ran into the night you broke up with Annah.\n\nThe one who just took away your weapons holds your dagger up in a threatening manner.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWait, I can\u2026ugh!\u201d you get out before taking a blade to your body repeatedly.\n\nEventually your body hangs limp and the Bloody Talons drop you to the ground. Then with a final killing blow, one of them jams the dagger into the back of your neck and leave your bloody body to be gnawed on by the alley rats until morning.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline her invitation", "result": "Maybe you\u2019re no longer with Annah, but if you\u2019re going to start fucking whores, you could still do better than Randi.\n\n\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m good.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, I understand. Still holding a candle for her huh? Y\u2019know, anytime I saw you two together she was bitching at you. If you ask me, you seem like you\u2019re better off anyway.\u201d Randi says.\n\u201cWell nobody asked you Randi, look just leave me alone, you aren\u2019t selling anything I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\n\nRandi now looks offended.\n\n\u201cOh fuck you asshole. You think you\u2019re better than me? Your girlfriend obviously didn\u2019t think so since she wised up and left your ass.\u201d Randi says.\n\u201cI broke up with her, you presumptuous whore.\u201d You say as she walks away waving a dismissing hand back at you.\n\nYou leave the Welcome Mat and go get yourself some food and then spend the rest of the day seeking out new burglary opportunities. Normally you would have spent the rest of the day doing the whole distract and con jobs with Annah, but without her around now, you\u2019re content on focusing no longer having to directly deal with people.\n\nYou spend the next few weeks working by yourself and generally getting by. You\u2019ve manage to nearly build up what you gave to Annah.\n\nDuring this time you\u2019re also mainly avoiding the Bloody Talons (along with the Klyton Militia) who are a little more aware of you now thanks to that night Annah mouthed off to them. Fucking Annah\u2026\n\nWhile you\u2019ve generally been having a fine time without her constant bitching, you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t still think about her. She was fun in a lot of physical ways, it was just about everything else she did that made her less fun.\n\nYou\u2019re still a little surprised that she hasn\u2019t popped up again on your doorstep. You thought maybe she would have by now. The fact that she hasn\u2019t does give you a little concern that maybe the Bloody Talons got a hold of her (or some similar fate) but if something bad has befallen her, there\u2019s not much you can do about it and it\u2019s certainly not your fault.\n\nThen again you did throw her out\u2026\n\n\u201cBah, stop thinking about her. You\u2019re better off. She probably went back home a lot richer than I am right now.\u201d You mutter to yourself.\n\nAs you\u2019re trying to put the thoughts of your ex out of your mind, you start wondering about the possibility of leaving Klyton yourself after you acquire a little more.\n\nBesides the Bloody Talons potentially giving you grief, they\u2019ve also been terrorizing the city with their actions, which means the Klyton Militia has been cracking down harder on everything.\n\nPart of you wonders if maybe you should just move on from this city, but you really loathe the idea of travelling again and you aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019d go. Hessla maybe?\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering your possible future you bump into Virgil as you\u2019re stepping in the Welcome Mat.\n\n\u201cHeeeeey youngster! (hic!) You got any spare\u2026.coppers fer the faith?\u201d Virgil asks.\n\nThe odor of Virgil\u2019s rancid breath hits you full force. You immediately cover your nose and mouth.\n\nYou thought the followers of Joachim were supposed to be into purity and restraint. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d think Joachim was the god of alcohol and hopeless drunks based on this guy\u2019s behavior and actions.\n\n\u201cShit, Virgil. When the hell was the last time you washed? You fucking smell worse than a troll\u2019s ass. Granted I\u2019ve never smelled a troll\u2019s ass, but I think it\u2019s a safe bet you smell worse than one.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGuess again. Hahahahahahaha! (hic) So can ya spare a copper?\u201d\n\u201cNo and I told you to stop bothering me Virgil! Don\u2019t you have a collection box you can pilfer booze money from?\u201d you shout.\n\u201cYeah\u2026but no\u2026but I got some (hic) news\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I already know about Joachim\u2019s blessed light. You tried to tell me about it the first time I came here and you nearly threw up on me in the process.\u201d\n\u201cI did? Geez, sorry son\u2026but this is different! (hic) Some\u2026somebody\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomebody what?\u201d\n\u201cSomebody was lookin\u2019 fer ya.\u201d\n\nWell that peaked your interest.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cYeah\u2026(hic) Yeah, this big guy. I mean not like ogre big, but just human big ya know? Old guy too. (hic) I mean not as old as that asshole who own this place, but probably around my age.\u201d Virgil says.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s still fucking old then, aren\u2019t you like seventy?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you. I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m in my forties\u2026I think\u2026yeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so big guy in his forties was looking for me. What did he want?\u201d\n\nOf course NOW Virgil decides to be uncooperative.\n\n\u201cNo! No! Fuck you, I\u2019m not tellin\u2019 you shit now. (hic) Who\u2026who\u2026what do you think I am some kinda asshole fer you to abuse? Callin\u2019 me seventy fuckin\u2019 years old. I oughta kick yer ass in the name of Joachim! Yer lucky I\u2019m a man of faith\u2026(hic)\u201d\n\nAt this point Virgil mumbles and stumbles away still mumbling and swearing.\n\nYou suppose you could always ask him again later when he\u2019s feeling less feisty. He will have likely forgotten all about your so-called insult later, of course he probably will have forgotten about the guy looking for you too.\n\nAs you head back to your room, you ponder who he could have been talking about. Your dad? Dad\u2019s not a big guy though and you honestly doubt if he would bother to come look for you.\n\nMight have been one of those Bloody Talon assholes, though honestly you\u2019re a bit surprised that they haven\u2019t shown up here before.\n\nOther than those possibilities, you\u2019re drawing a blank of who might be looking for you. It\u2019s a little concerning though.\n\nYou\u2019ll just remain alert and keep an eye out this guy looking for you. Remain on your guard too, since you still don\u2019t know if this man means you harm or not. Hopefully Virgil can tell you something later.\n\nFor now though you decide to get some sleep after your long night of thievery. As your lids get heavier, you think on where you could ply your trade with a little more ease and a lot more loot. The rich areas are well patrolled, the government district is well patrolled, the merchant district is well patrolled and has Bloody Talons running about, and the poor areas are definitely Bloody Talon territory and the folks don\u2019t have shit.\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you that you\u2019ve never really tried the university district of the city. Might be worth a look, after all it should be filled with stupid rich kids not aware of their surroundings and the Talons don\u2019t seem to go running around there, so there might be less heat overall.\n\nYou wake up midday. After getting yourself ready for today\u2019s endeavors, you knock on Virgil\u2019s door, but there is no answer. He\u2019s either still asleep or he\u2019s out collecting donations for Joachim. Probably the latter considering you didn\u2019t contribute to his booze fund.\n\nYou leave the Welcome Mat Inn, though a little more cautiously than usual. Nobody seems to be approaching or giving you suspicious looks though. Still, wishing to keep a low profile, you stick to the back streets as much as possible and eventually when you get to the better part of town, you catch a coach for your remaining trip to the university. By the time you arrive, the day is beginning to end, but you soon find that the university is still fairly active.\n\nAfter a few hours of just scouting and walking around, it\u2019s much like you figured. A lot of scholarly types with their noses in books and rich kids that do a lot of partying. The dorms have security, but oddly not as much as one might think.\n\nYou find that despite being dressed in your lower class clothing, nobody is really giving you a second glance. It might be due to your youth though; you probably just look like a struggling student. Wasn\u2019t like your dad was exactly rich when he attended this place either.\n\nIt occurs to you how strange it is to be at the university at all. You never thought you\u2019d ever \u201cattend\u201d your dad\u2019s old place of higher learning. You\u2019re sure at one time he had hopes you would, but it probably wasn\u2019t under these circumstances.\n\nAs you\u2019re having these inner reflections, you see a group of people hanging around laughing and generally having their attention focused on a little black and white curly haired dog, which is enjoying the attention.\n\nWhat gains your attention however is you recognize one of these people. It\u2019s Annah!\n\nHer hair is fixed up and she\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s the daughter of some rich nobleman. Looks like she put all that loot you gave her and indeed bought herself something nice and apparently she\u2019s bought a dog as well. You never knew she wanted one of those.\n\nAnnah hasn\u2019t seen you, but that\u2019s probably because she\u2019s busy picking everyone\u2019s pockets while they\u2019re all distracted and laughing. Or rather she\u2019s trying to, the problem is the dog moves around enough that people are constantly changing the direction of where they\u2019re looking.\n\nYou shake your head and move towards the group.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m new here and I\u2019m looking for the medical school.\u201d You say.\n\nAnnah\u2019s eyes instantly go wide and then they narrow with a \u201cGet the fuck out of here.\u201d look. Meanwhile her little dog has also seen you and unlike with everyone else, it has decided to growl and give a little bark before running behind someone\u2019s leg.\n\n\u201cOh, sure it\u2019s just past those buildings over there.\u201d Someone answers.\n\u201cOver there? I just came from over there and I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cNo, over to the west. There\u2019s a big statue. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\u201cThe big statue with the sword? I was over that way too and still didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s on the east side, I\u2019m talking about the west side. There\u2019s a statue of a physician wearing a plague mask.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen that. Where did you say it was again?\u201d\n\u201cThe west side! The west!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, calm down! I was just asking where the medical school is and you\u2019re giving me directions to a statue.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not give\u2026.argh.\u201d\n\u201cHere let me try\u2026\u201d a girl says stepping in to explain.\n\nYou manage to keep up this idiot charade for quite awhile completely exasperating the entire group to the point where several of them are calling you a retard and don\u2019t know how the hell you\u2019re even breathing, let alone getting in this university.\n\nMeanwhile Annah realizes what you\u2019re doing and manages to easily pick everyone\u2019s pockets while they\u2019re focused on you. She then takes off with her dog.\n\n\u201cOh wait, I\u2019m supposed to go to the school of magic, not medicine. Duh. Apologies.\u201d You say trying not to laugh while everyone calls you names.\n\nAs you walk away you decide to call it a night. While you didn\u2019t really engage in any lucrative opportunities yourself, you\u2019re sort of glad to learn that Annah is alive and well. You suppose you do miss her a bit.\n\nIn any case, you decide that the university district might be the place to start plying your trade since the militia patrols are infrequent and the Bloody Talon assholes aren\u2019t around here.\n\nOf course that might mean bumping into Annah again so that\u2019s definitely a potential drawback, but it\u2019s still a big place and she doesn\u2019t have some claim on it. You\u2019ll try to stay out of her way though if you happen to see her.\n\nOver the next few days you start making your routine visits to the university. You find it particularly easy to just go into the dorms and start pilfering things. These students have more money than a sense of security it seems. And the actual university security must be everyone that tried out for the Klyton militia and failed miserably.\n\nAfter a week of looting the male dorms you decide to change it up and move on to the female dorms. You\u2019ll have to be more stealthy considering you can\u2019t just wander about as freely in there, but you\u2019ve been doing this long enough now that you\u2019re confident that you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems.\n\nFortunately there are always a lot of parties going on and this weekend there is a big one that everyone is supposed to be excited to go to, so you figure that\u2019s the best time to strike.\n\nAfter some stealthy moves you get in and begin rummaging through empty rooms. You\u2019re doing fairly well until you get to your fifth room and as you\u2019re going through one of the drawers you suddenly hear a little growl.\n\n\u201cI KNEW you were fucking stalking me! Get out! Get the fuck out of my room!\u201d Annah suddenly shouts and hits you in the head with a shoe. You have no idea where she was hiding, you thought you were pretty observant and careful.\n\n\u201cOw! Your room?\u201d you say and begin blocking her attacks.\n\u201cYes! This is my fucking room! Checkers attack!\u201d Annah commands and you feel her fluffy hound viciously bite you on the ankle.\n\u201cFuck! Little shit!\u201d you say and kick the beast off of you causing it to yelp and hide behind Annah though still growling.\n\u201cYou fucking asshole! You kicked my dog!\u201d\n\u201cYou told it to attack me! And how the hell is this your room, since when are you in college?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? What? You didn\u2019t think I could make it on my own did you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t! I knew it! You\u2019ve never supported me! Well as you can see I\u2019m doing just fine without you, better in fact!\u201d\n\u201cOh sure, that\u2019s why I had to help you last week distracting those idiots you were trying to pick pocket.\u201d\n\u201cI was doing just fine with that! So why the fuck are you here anyway? You trying to get back with me? Because if you are, that ship has sailed a long time ago the moment you threw me out! Now stop stalking me and get out before I call security!\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to explain yourself", "result": "As usual Annah\u2019s overreacting and you just need to calm her down.\n\n\u201cAnnah, if you could just calm down a fucking second, I\u2019m not fucking stalking you! I happen to\u2026\u201d you start to say before she interrupts.\n\u201cHELP THERE\u2019S A RAPIST IN MY ROOM! HELP! HELP!\u201d Annah screams.\n\u201cAnnah! Are you fucking kidding me?!\u201d\n\nAnnah doesn\u2019t stop screaming though and then her dog starts barking again. This causes you to try to shut her up by grabbing her, but this just makes things worse as she begins to struggle and hit you while continuing to scream. Then on top of that, her dog bites your leg again.\n\nRealizing that she\u2019s in no mood to listen to reason and is just determined to get you out of here, you release her and shake her mutt off your leg and turn to leave. Before you get out the door though she throws something at you which hits you in the head pretty hard.\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d You utter and stumble out the door.\n\u201cI hope I cracked your fucking skull RAPIST!\u201d Annah continues to shout.\n\nYou stagger as fast as you can out of the dorm, but thanks to the blow to your head, you\u2019re feeling pretty dizzy. Annah\u2019s shouting also drew the attention of the few others that were currently in the dorm. The fact that she screamed rape doesn\u2019t help as now every other woman in the place is screaming too.\n\nYou don\u2019t get far from the dorm when security shows up. Any other time security isn\u2019t a problem around here, but when several women are screaming rapist they come heavy.\n\nA gunshot is heard as you\u2019re trying to flee causing you to instinctively duck, though due to your dizziness, you end up tripping and falling.\n\nYou manage to get back up and then another gunshot rings out. This one unfortunately hitting you in the back. You fall back down to the ground and don\u2019t get up again.\n\nIf you were still alive, you probably wouldn\u2019t have found it surprising that Annah cried over you for weeks apologizing that she got you killed.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Just leave", "result": "When Annah is like this, she\u2019s just going to keep on, and since she\u2019s obviously managed to fool people into thinking that she\u2019s a registered student here, you\u2019re at a disadvantage if she starts causing trouble. Best to just leave.\n\nYou hold up your hands and bow your head.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, you win. I\u2019ll go. You won\u2019t see me anymore. Didn\u2019t mean to intrude and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well for yourself and not laying dead somewhere. I really mean that.\u201d You say and back off.\n\nAnnah just sniffs at you with a scowl while petting Checkers in her arms.\n\nYou leave the dorm with haste as well as the campus. Then its trip back to \u201chome sweet home.\u201d You save your coin and walk back tonight, part of that walk involves thinking about Annah. You sort of figured you\u2019d bump into her again, maybe on some level you might have even wanted to, but you didn\u2019t expect it to be like that.\n\nYou\u2019re guessing she\u2019s been lying about being in college, but it has to be more than that if she\u2019s actually living in one of the dorms. You remember your dad saying he lived in one for a while and how it was a big hassle to get a room in one.\n\nYou can only think that she stole someone\u2019s identity and maybe some forgery was involved. You suppose she could have paid someone to forge something or maybe they just don\u2019t bother checking the records very close anymore.\n\nIn any case, she\u2019s apparently got a sweet set up for however long it lasts. Sort of wish you\u2019d thought of something like that. You guess you under-estimated her resourcefulness.\n\n\u201cWhy the hell wasn\u2019t she suggesting this shit when we were together, instead of bitching all the time? Things might have\u2026ugh, fuck it.\u201d You mutter.\n\nYou get home to the Welcome Mat and bump into Trobart, the crusty owner of the place. He gives you a dirty look like he gives you all the time.\n\n\u201cHey you thieving asshole, I hope you stole enough to make rent this month because I\u2019m raising it.\u201d He suddenly says.\n\u201cWhat?

What message?\u201d\n\u201cSome big guy probably in his forties or fifties, with a bushy beard, shaved head and weathered face came in and started asking everyone about you like he was the fucking Klyton Militia, put everyone on fucking edge.\u201d\n\u201cWas he armed or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo he wasn\u2019t fucking armed, at least not openly, but he was big and asking questions.

I swear if you bring trouble here, I\u2019m throwing your ass out!\u201d\n\u201cYeah yeah got it.\u201d You say trying not to be excessively dismissive.\n\u201cIn any case, the fucker said he was carrying an important message for you from your family and that it\u2019s very urgent that you meet him at the Raggedy Man Inn.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s fucking it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d\n\nTrobart shakes his head at you and moves on while you head back to your room. Along the way, you bump into Virgil who you haven\u2019t seen in a long time and were looking for, but now that Trobart\u2019s given you the info\u2026\n\n\u201cHeeeeey you\u2026\u201d Virgil starts to say.\n\u201cLost your chance Virgil, get out of my way.\u201d You say and shove him aside causing him to fall.\n\nYou shut your door, ignoring Virgil\u2019s cursing and pondering this new information you\u2019ve been given.\n\nWell this just keeps getting weirder. All you know about the Raggedy Man Inn is that it\u2019s in a worse part of Klyton than even you stay at. If this guy is some sort of courier, surely he already knows where to find you, especially if this is an urgent message from your family. And you can\u2019t begin to know what that might be if true. And why the hell wouldn\u2019t he just leave the message here? Unless it\u2019s something he has to deliver personally.\n\nPart of you wants to just head to the Raggedy Man Inn to confront this person once and for all, but all of this sounds so damn suspicious that you can\u2019t imagine going there would do you any good other than getting caught in a trap.\n\nBloody Talons, pissed off ex, and some mysterious asshole looking for you, maybe its just time to leave Klyton completely. You really hate having to travel again though. Maybe you just need to find a better place to live. You\u2019ll think more on this tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow comes and you go back to the university to ply your trade without any incident this time. You don\u2019t see Annah thankfully, but you\u2019ve been keeping away from the female dorms and any popular gathering spots since that seems to be how she\u2019s working the place.\n\nYou\u2019ve actually taken an interest in sneaking into the medical school and stealing various drugs lying around. While it\u2019s not exactly an area you\u2019ve been into before, you\u2019re fairly certain there\u2019s a market in selling typically unavailable drugs (and more reliable).\n\nYou keep up your usual caution and after about a week, nobody is trying to tell you that some guy is looking for you anymore. You end up wondering if it was some message from your family after all.\n\nYou\u2019ve also made a nice profit from your dabbling in the drug trade. You even managed to perhaps get the Bloody Talons off your back since you sold to a lone Talon who seemed agreeable to the idea that maybe he could convince others to leave you alone if you managed to get more of the stuff. (You still aren\u2019t allowed to work on their turf though)\n\nWith things going well you continue with your life a little more relaxed. And while you\u2019re coming back from the university one night\u2026\n\nNo sooner have you opened the door, when a hand strongly grips your hand and yanks you inside. You feel a foot trip you and you go plunging face first into the floor and hear the door being shut behind you.\n\n\u201cNow hol\u2026\u201d you start to say before you feel a boot kicking you in the side of the head.\n\n\u201cStop talking, I don\u2019t want to hear your voice. This has to happen.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou manage to roll over and see a muscular older man with a beard standing over you with a very large knife.\n\nThis is the man that was looking for you.\n\n\u201cWho\u2026\u201d you start to say again before the man descends on top of your body and punches you in the face with his free hand.\n\n\u201cI said shut up! I thought about this. I thought about the pros and cons for a long time. The right and wrong. And ultimately it all comes back to justice.\u201d The man says.\n\nYou never put it together based on the vague descriptions by other people before, but you know who this man is. He\u2019s Klint\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cYou took away my son and not only did you escape, but I see you merely plying your criminal ways here too. I could have easily told the Klyton militia about you, but no, I want to perform this justice myself. Not just for my son you murdered, but for ALL those you\u2019ve hurt!\u201d he shouts.\n\n\u201cCheckers attack!\u201d you hear and this is followed by growling.\n\u201cAGH! Shit! Get off!\u201d Klint\u2019s father shouts as Annah\u2019s dog has once again proven to be a vicious ankle biter.\n\nYou have no idea when or why Annah was following you, but you\u2019re glad she did. (And a testament to her stealth skills again, because you never even knew she was)\n\nTaking advantage of the distraction, you grab Klint\u2019s father\u2019s wrist and wrestle the knife from his grip. The man is strong for his age, but between you, Checkers and even Annah hitting him in the head with a blackjack, you manage to disarm him and slide out from underneath.\n\n\u201cFucking bitch!\u201d KF shouts, getting in an upright position, kicking Checkers off of his leg and slapping Annah at the same time.\n\n\u201cI remember you too, you fucking whore. You can join your\u2026Urk!\u201d KF says before you interrupt him by stabbing him in the back.\n\nHe clumsily punches at you by flailing his arms backwards and even hits you in the face, but you don\u2019t stop, you pull out the dagger and stab him again.\n\nAnd again, and again, and again, until he\u2019s lost his strength to even stand anymore. And then with all your strength you sink the blade in the back of his damned neck severing his spinal column from the rest of his head and through the front so part of the tip is coming out.\n\n\u201cStop! He\u2019s dead!\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cShit\u2026yeah\u2026(pant) the fuck you come from?\u201d you gasp.\n\u201cI followed you obviously, but let\u2019s talk about that later, we need to get the fuck outta here!\u201d\n\u201cFuck, right. Hold on.\u201d\n\nYou immediately go grab your savings stash and shove it in your pack, while Annah has already picked up her dog and took off.\n\n\u201cHey cut out the noise! What the fuck are you degenerates doing over\u2026.oh what the fuck?!\u201d Trobart says as he stands in the hallway just outside your door as you trying to exit the room.\n\u201cFuck. Look, here.\u201d You say and hand him a shitload of coins and even a few gems you had.\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t fucking enough! You\u2019ve murdered this asshole right in my damn hotel! This is fucking serious! I run a clean place here.\u201d\n\u201cFine, here.\u201d You say dropping a few more coins in his overfilled hands which fall to the floor.\n\u201cNo, this is too fucking far! You\u2019re gonna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this\u2026\u201d\n\nYou suddenly slam Trobart up against the wall which surprises the hell out of him.\n\n\u201cLook here, you old fuck! This asshole just tried to kill me and it was self defense! But even if you don\u2019t believe that then believe this, if I can do THAT to this fucker, I can do WORSE to your ass. You tell the fucking militia and I will fucking burn this shithole to the damn ground and everyone in it after ram my fist up your ass and tear out your damn spine!\u201d you threaten.\n\u201cAlright! Alright! Shit! I know how to keep quiet you crazy fuck!\u201d Trobart exclaims.\n\u201cGood, keep the coin.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave as quickly as possible. No sign of Annah, but then she always was good at making herself scarce whenever the shit really went down.\n\nYou get a few blocks away and sure enough, you hear her.\n\n\u201cHey! Over here!\u201d you hear Annah say from an alleyway. You stop and go over to her.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d she asks while holding Checkers who curls up as close as she can to Annah when she sees you.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Probably won\u2019t need to worry about the law this time either. Well hopefully anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cHm, so why the hell were you following me? And before you even start, YES I am thankful you did, otherwise Klint\u2019s father probably would have killed me\u2026shit I just realized I\u2019ve killed that entire bloodline now and nearly under the same circumstances. Fucking hell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI was following you because I wanted to talk to you since I\u2019m well aware that you\u2019ve still been thieving at the university. Though I appreciate that you were staying out of my way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, have you been following me on the campus as well? Didn\u2019t you just accuse me of stalking you the last time we met?\u201d\n\u201cYou were in my room! What the hell was I supposed to think? Look, I just want to know, were you serious when you said you were glad to see I was doing well without you?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little envious that you\u2019ve managed to have it a lot easier than me so quickly, but yes, I\u2019d rather see you doing well than as I said before laying dead somewhere. I mean\u2026yeah I guess I was an asshole that night I threw you out, but fuck you can\u2019t deny that you didn\u2019t play some part in compelling me to it.\u201d\n\nAnnah surprisingly nods her head a bit.\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026but you didn\u2019t have to be so mean. I cried over you for days.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d You retort.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s true you asshole! You were my first love, I had fun with you! And I thought you felt the same! I figured the best way to get over you was to just do it, but you still lingered in my mind every once in awhile. THEN you suddenly show up at the university and stir all my shit up again! I go some nights feeling sick thinking about what went so wrong that caused us to break up.\u201d Annah says getting emotional.\n\nWell now you really do feel like an asshole. You actually figured if Annah did have any strong feelings for you, she had gotten over them fairly quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry Annah.\u201d You say not really knowing how to follow up.\n\u201cLook\u2026\u201d Annah says trying to maintain her composure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should get back together, because I dunno I guess you\u2019re right, maybe we\u2019re just not good like that. But we got history and I can\u2019t ignore that. I don\u2019t know anyone else in this city. Or at least nobody I really connect with. I still need ONE person that I really know in this city. Someone I can count on. So maybe\u2026 we can still work together from time to time?\u201d\n\nYou nod.\n\n\u201cOf course. If there\u2019s ever some big job or even small job that you want to pull off and need extra help with, I\u2019ll be around.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well, I should get back. What are you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, find a new place to live I guess. Maybe move some place more upscale, hey how exactly DID you pull off living in a dorm anyway? I mean I have so many question about that situation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well maybe another time. Anyway you take care, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\nAnnah turns and walks off. You watch her and follow her a bit until you see her catch a carriage.\n\nIt\u2019s been a weird night. Your encounter with Annah aside, you still haven\u2019t fully processed the fact that you had to kill Klint\u2019s father tonight. You aren\u2019t quite sure how you feel about that, except better him than you.\n\nAnd that you really need to invest in a flintlock. You\u2019re done with this wrestling around on the floor with a knife shit.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 21\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re raising the rent here?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cHey, cost of living. Or more specially Klyton raising property taxes to put it into security of the city. Your Bloody Talon pals have really been raising hell lately.\u201d Hank replies.\n\u201cThe Talons are far from being my pals. I don\u2019t even do business with those crazy fuckers anymore. Haven\u2019t ever since they pulled that shit last year where killed a bunch of the militia. Associating with psycho assholes on any level like that is a sure way of getting targeted.\u201d\n\u201cWell be that as it may, the new rent price remains. Hey, you should be lucky; I\u2019m letting you stay here. I don\u2019t generally have people making their homes here. Clientele tends to be travelling merchants and such staying for awhile, which I know damn well you\u2019re stealing from. Another risk I\u2019m taking.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m also getting you proper pain killers for cheap and you don\u2019t have to roll the dice getting whatever the shit the apothecary thinks is going to work on any given day.\u201d\n\u201cAnother reason you\u2019re getting to stay here.\u201d\n\u201cBah, you let that dumb poet stay here for fucking free and as far as I can tell all she does is drive away your customers with her horrible poetry that she does on stage.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well unless you\u2019re somehow suddenly transforming into a young girl that\u2019s willing to suck my dick on a regular basis, you don\u2019t get to stay for free.\u201d\n\nYou think for a moment.\n\n\u201cSay Hank, what would you say if I told you I could find some actual talent to grace that stage of yours that might drum up more business?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d say that would certainly go a long way in decreasing your rent. The problem with that plan is I\u2019m going to have to pay for actual talent unless you know of some idiots that are going to work for free or practically for free.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure I could probably find some.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be waiting then.\u201d\n\nGreat, now all you have to do is go find some starving artist types.\n\nTime to take a trip to the university, specifically to the school of arts. Personally you\u2019ve always tended to stay away from that area due to the unbearable pretentiousness and the fact that the fuckers never much coin to their name. Must be nice not having to do shit all day and having your expensive \u201ceducation\u201d being paid for you.\n\nYou never really thought about it before, but shit, your dad worked fucking hard to achieve his goals. Makes you almost feel guilty about the fact that you pursued a life of crime, but at least you\u2019ve got a little of his \u201cwork ethic\u201d right?\n\nAlso makes you appreciate some of the songs your sister made up in her spare time. Granted you never were much into some of the songs she wrote, but even when she was sixteen she was writing shit a lot better (and certainly playing a lot better) than some of these so called bards around here. Hopefully she\u2019s doing well, wherever she is.\n\nKnowing how Hank has a predilection for young girls, you attempt talk up some of those first.\n\nUnfortunately you aren\u2019t having much success for whatever reason. Normally something like this would crush your ego, but since you doing this more to alleviate your financial costs rather than getting laid, you\u2019re just more annoyed than anything else.\n\nMoving on to guys, you don\u2019t have much success there either. It would appear nobody is interested in slumming and are perfectly content on plying their trade at the artsy locations around the campus. You question how ANY of these fuckers know anything about \u201clife experience\u201d if they aren\u2019t even traveling out of their comfort zones.\n\n\u201cBunch of fucking poseurs. And of course none of them got two gold coins to their name.\u201d You mutter as you go through the pittance you managed to steal.\n\nAs you\u2019re taking a break from your failed talent search, you run into a more familiar face.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing on this part of campus? These fuckers don\u2019t have any coin and if you\u2019re trying to sell them drugs, you\u2019re doomed to fail since most of them all smoke that shitty version of Green Lotus that they grow themselves. Barely even gets you high.\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cNo kidding. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve smelled since I\u2019ve been here. Hate it. I wouldn\u2019t even be here if I wasn\u2019t trying to find cheap talent for the inn I\u2019m currently living at. What\u2019re you doing here? And where\u2019s that little hell hound of yours?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI got a roommate that take classes over here and she needed me to help her move her big ass painting. Looks like she just vomited paint all over a white board, but I guess that\u2019s what gets you an A around here. As for Checkers, she\u2019s safely asleep at my place. So talent search huh? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d\n\u201cJust trying to lower my rent a bit. Hey, you got any more artsy friends that are into poetry and singing and shit like that?\u201d\n\u201cEh, not really. Even Jenny, the one I just helped I\u2019m only good with because she helped with a couple jobs last year.\u201d\n\nYou tilt your head.\n\n\u201cBeen doing jobs without me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t need a master lock pick or safe cracker all the time. Sometimes honeyed words will do.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you needed any help in that department.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually, but let\u2019s just say Jenny\u2019s willing to go that extra step sometimes to gain access to the inaccessible. Under certain circumstances, you\u2019d probably like her.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I\u2019ll bet. Well I guess I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d\n\u201cWhat so soon? We haven\u2019t seen each other for awhile. Come, I\u2019ll help you. What are you looking for exactly? \u201c Annah asks.\n\nYou explain the situation in greater detail and Annah says that she (or Jenny at least) can probably find what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\u201cNow, we can probably convince some of these girls into slumming, but the problem is, they aren\u2019t going to want to stick around. Especially if you\u2019re trying practically pimp them out to some gross old inn owner. So this means that doesn\u2019t really solve your issues. What you need is someone that\u2019s going to come back and is willing to work for practically nothing. Would a band suffice, because I got one in mind and they\u2019ll probably just perform for free drinks.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cSure, what\u2019s the catch?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell they\u2019re a group of elves for one thing and I think you know how unruly those fuckers can get. It\u2019s mainly why this band doesn\u2019t play many places outside the few locations around the campus that are prepared for their brand of wild shit since most tavern and inn owners don\u2019t want to deal with them. Now the plus side is they\u2019re going to draw a crowd, believe me. I\u2019ve seen it multiple times.\u201d\n\u201cYou think they\u2019ll go for it?\u201d\n\u201cSure, they\u2019re elves. They are probably eager to play at a whole new location for a change. Plus Jenny will probably fuck all of them if that doesn\u2019t convince them.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Okay then. Oh, they aren\u2019t too destructive are they?\u201d\n\u201cEh, not in the traditional sense no. I mean any damage they do cause is mostly confined to on stage and going to be minor compared to the crowd they bring in. However, they do have some rather interesting theatrics on stage. It\u2019s part of why people like to watch them.\u201d\n\u201cSounds reasonable I guess. What are they called anyway?\u201d\n\u201cNature\u2019s Revenge.\u201d\n\u201cHm, how elven. Alright when\u2019s the soonest you can get all this done?\u201d\n\u201cProbably in a couple days. You\u2019re at the Laughing Devil right? We\u2019ll just show up on the weekend. Tell your inn owner to be prepared for a large crowd. Larger than that place has ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good. Well guess that\u2019s it then. Glad I ran into you. Been awhile since we\u2019ve worked together on something.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it has.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you still in those dorms?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nah. Couldn\u2019t keep up that ruse forever and still be officially enrolled here without arousing suspicion. I just live with Jenny now in this small home her parents pretty much paid for.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Annah has a much better set up than you do. Not that you really care\u2026okay maybe you\u2019re curious, but you have to ask\u2026\n\n\u201cUm, so you and this Jenny\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah rolls her eyes.\n\n\u201cEw. No. And you wish.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cOkay, okay, I had to ask. I still don\u2019t know how you originally pulled off this whole college student thing, which you still won\u2019t tell me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnother time perhaps. So what about you? You still living your usual frugal existence? I\u2019m guessing so if you\u2019re concerned about your living arrangements.\u201d\n\u201cThe Laughing Devil isn\u2019t that cheap, and far from being the shithole the Welcome Mat was so it\u2019s not that frugal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m also guessing you\u2019ve probably got a small fortune hidden away like one of those dragon stories of old.\u201d\n\u201cYou always did know me.\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s one thing I never understood about you, why do you bother saving? You\u2019re an excellent thief. I mean I\u2019d never deny that. You could be living so much better than you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we can\u2019t all be blessed with the charisma you have.\u201d\n\u201cYou could probably work on that, but that\u2019s beside the point. I\u2019m just saying you could be doing better. Sometimes I think you\u2019re content on being a near do well.\u201d\n\nNow you roll your eyes.\n\n\u201cRight. This coming from the woman who is sponging off some other woman who is sponging off her parents. Look, you got your way of doing things, I got mine. I once again thank you for your help, but we\u2019re not fucking so I don\u2019t have to listen to this\u2026whatever this is.\u201d You say.\n\nYou start to walk away.\n\n\u201cWell what if we were fucking?\u201d\n\nYou turn around.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI know you heard me. And I KNOW damn well you still think about it. I\u2019ve know the stories about you requesting that those little brothel whores to try to look like me when you\u2019re at those places.\u201d\n\u201cI did that like maybe few times years ago after we first broke up! Fuck, I mean I didn\u2019t\u2026shit\u2026how do you even know about that?\u201d\n\u201cFace it, you never got over me.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, considering that you have more of a habit of spying and stalking me, I\u2019d say that could be said more about you.\u201d\n\nAt this point Annah walks up closer to you. She\u2019s actually looking pretty good right now. The make up isn\u2019t too much, but it\u2019s definitely enough to make her look more seductive than she might normally. She smells nice too. Some sort of flowery perfume you guess. Living in luxury has its perks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never denied it. Doesn\u2019t matter how many other guys I\u2019ve been with since you, I\u2019ve always said you were the first and will probably be my only true love.\u201d Annah says running her index finger down the side of your face.\n\u201cI see\u2026wait\u2026how many guys have you been with?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHah\u2026you jealous? See? Why don\u2019t you just admit that you fucked up, and breaking up with me was the worst mistake you ever made? Think about all time we\u2019ve spent apart in this city yet still working great together as a team stealing from rich asshole\u2019s houses that I\u2019ve cased. It\u2019s always been me and you versus everyone else. So much of that time while fruitful, could have been a lot more fun if we had been still intimate. I miss the fun we had. Don\u2019t you miss the fun?\u201d\n\nAnnah now practically has her legs wrapped around you. Fortunately you\u2019re still in the school of arts area so nobody is really paying much attention since public outdoor fucking isn\u2019t that uncommon around here, what with everyone being a free spirit and all.\n\nWhile you might just be thinking with your dick right now, you\u2019d still rather have a bit of privacy.\n\n\u201cOkay, Annah you got my attention, but if we\u2019re gonna do this, we need more privacy.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course, let\u2019s go back to your place.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cMy place? That\u2019s a little far. Can\u2019t we just go to yours? Your roommate is in class right now.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I\u2019d rather not. Without going into too much detail, I tried to have company over once when she wasn\u2019t around and she pitched a bitch about it. And given what I\u2019ve got in store for you, it\u2019s going to be real obvious I\u2019ve had someone over. Hell, we might not even be done by the time she gets back.\u201d\n\nYou smile a little at that remark.\n\n\u201cIs that right? Well maybe we can spare the extra time to go back to my place. We\u2019re taking a carriage though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood, we can start on the way there then.\u201d Annah says.\n\nSo after quickly catching a carriage and getting inside in, Annah is true to her word and wastes no time in getting started.\n\nBy the gods you have missed her mouth\u2026\n\nWhen you reach the Laughing Devil, you almost just want to fuck her in the carriage rather than pulling your pants up and going to your room.\n\nHowever you manage to do it anyway and are practically running with one hand holding up your pants and the other grabbing Annah\u2019s hand who is keeping up with your pace and going on about how she\u2019s going to do all those things that you had those whores do, but do it way better.\n\nYou still don\u2019t know how she knew about some of that stuff, but you\u2019re eager to see her prove herself.\n\nYou manage to get to your room and you\u2019ve got your dick in her before you even get to the bed. In any case, once again Annah isn\u2019t fucking around (so to speak) and proves just what you\u2019ve been missing all these years.\n\nYou seriously don\u2019t remember it being this good before. Not that it was ever really bad with her, but this is something else. She\u2019s either learned something in the time you\u2019ve been apart or she\u2019s been holding back all this time.\n\nIt\u2019s so good in fact that you actually feel genuinely drained and get sleepy soon after you climax.\n\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026I love you\u2026\u201d you utter and then drift off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Later...", "result": "You wake up and find that it\u2019s now nighttime. You groggily look around and don\u2019t see Annah. You call out to her, but there is no answer.\n\nYou sit up and after stretching a bit, you suddenly have a horrible realization.\n\n\u201cOh shit. Shit! Shit! No, no, no, no. Fuck!\u201d you say as you immediately go to the loose floorboard under the dresser where you keep your hidden savings.\n\nYou continue to curse yourself for being so stupid and not realizing something was up from the start.\n\nAnd then you find that your savings are still there. Even the blade trap you have set hasn\u2019t been disturbed. You then breathe sigh a relief as you put everything back.\n\nWhile Annah didn\u2019t rip you off, you guess that she just didn\u2019t want to stick around. You figure that she had to get back to the university to get prepare things on her end. Or at least you thought she did until she comes walking back in the room.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re finally up sleepyhead. Given how long you slept, guessing you haven\u2019t had that sort of loving in a long time. Not surprised.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still here.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOf course I am. Did you not want me to be?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I do. I\u2019m just surprised.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What, did you think I was going to do, rob you blind while you were asleep and leave?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPfft, liar. You DID think that. I bet you checked all your hiding spots in this room after you woke up.\u201d\n\nYour silence confirms her accusations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I probably would have done the same. I came on so strong I guess it would be natural for you to have some suspicion.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cActually, at the time I wasn\u2019t thinking at all except the obvious. In fact the only worry I had was that you might be fucking with me and were going to just leave me at the university with a massive hard on.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019d never do that to you.\u201d\n\u201cSo where did you go?\u201d\n\u201cOh I just came back from speaking to your inn owner Hank. Told him that all about the cheap talent that\u2019s going to grace his inn this weekend. He seemed receptive to the idea. Kept staring at my tits the whole time, I\u2019m assuming if I hadn\u2019t mentioned that I was your girlfriend, he would have tried to touch me as well. Ugh, he\u2019s gross. But in any case everything\u2019s set on this side, I just have to speak with Nature\u2019s Revenge and a few others and this place will be party central.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to speak to Hank, I would \u2018ve done that, but thanks for saving me the trouble. You\u2019ve certainly been more than helpful today.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose I do have an ulterior motive of sorts.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026oh well I guess you\u2019re telling me to my face at least. Alright out with it.\u201d\n\nAnnah sits next to you on the bed and holds one of your hands. This must be serious.\n\n\u201cI need your help on a job.\u201d She says.\n\u201c\u2026that\u2019s it? I thought you were going to ask for something unreasonable. Wait, are we trying to rob a bank or city hall or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing like that. Just need you to crack open Jenny\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re totally confused. Annah smiles and explains before you can ask the obvious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried several times to get into the thing while she wasn\u2019t around, but no luck. I\u2019m just not skilled at it like you are. I need an expert.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cWell that answers one obvious question, but why other one would be why? I mean not that I particularly care I suppose, but I was under the impression you were somewhat friends with this girl.\u201d\n\u201cEh, we have common interests in some regards. She\u2019s a typical rich kid doing illegal shit every now and then for kicks, but lately she\u2019s been sort of a bitch to live with. Which brings me to my other reason of why I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m leaving the city so I figured I wouldn\u2019t leave empty handed.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving the city?! Why? Where are you going to go? Did you intend on telling me?\u201d\n\nAnnah goes on to tell you that she\u2019s getting bored of Klyton and wants to see more of the world. She says that when she first came to Klyton she initially wanted to live here for the rest of her life, believing it to have everything she\u2019d ever want. She then says its funny that masquerading as a university student caused her to learn more about the world and how she wants to see more of it.\n\nSo that\u2019s why she\u2019s leaving. As for telling you, she said she went back and forth on whether or not if she should since even though you weren\u2019t together any more, she got the impression that you might be inclined to talk her out of leaving. Running into you when she did and your reaction to her advances sort of solved that personal dilemma though.\n\n\u201cI want you to come with me.\u201d She says.\n\u201cAnnah\u2026\u201d you start to say.\n\u201cI know, I know, you\u2019re not a traveller and you hate it, but you\u2019ll be with me. That should certainly take some of the sting out. And I know\u2026I know in the past how I was always nagging you. I think you\u2019ll find that I\u2019ve changed a lot since then.\u201d\n\u201cWell that is true.\u201d\n\u201cI mean I want us to start completely over together and part of that would be leaving this city and going some place else.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would we go?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, anywhere. Hessla for starters? The point is I want you to come with me. I mean\u2026I just don\u2019t see it as a bad idea given how we obviously feel towards each other.\u201d\n\nWell Annah always does get right to the point on how she really feels about you. Maybe she\u2019s right, maybe you could use a change of scenery. You\u2019ve certainly saved more than enough to move and live comfortably elsewhere. (You assume Hessla is probably cheaper, if that\u2019s your first destination)\n\n\u201cOkay, Annah. I\u2019ll come with you, but that sort of makes this getting elven musicians and shit here sort of pointless.\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I mean I still need some time to get ready for the trip and I imagine even with your meager belongings you might not want to just suddenly jump on a carriage. Also, this weekend is still going to be the best time to go rob Jenny\u2019s safe since she\u2019s going to be home the rest of the week. I can also convince her to come with me here to enjoy the show. So while I\u2019m here with her, you can go clean out her safe and take a few other items as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo what exactly did this Jenny do to you?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, she\u2019s been a fucking bitch and even if I wasn\u2019t leaving the city, I\u2019d probably be moving out soon anyway. Trust me, she\u2019s got this coming.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging. So of course I\u2019ll need some more information on the lay out of this place.\u201d\n\nAnnah goes into great detail about her place of residence and everything you\u2019ll find in it. She mentions the safe itself is under the bed, but points out that Jenny has a few nice pieces of jewelry in another more accessible box on her dresser. When you ask if she knows what\u2019s actually in the safe, Annah says as far as she knows there are some valuable family heirlooms in there and probably a few gems and coins as well.\n\n\u201cJenny might come from money, but she\u2019s a bit of a hording cheapskate, somewhat like you in that regard. As I said, under different circumstances, you\u2019d probably get along with her.\u201d Annah say with a chuckle.\n\nAnnah then tells you that when you\u2019re done robbing the place; meet her back at the Laughing Devil and you can go from there.\n\nIn the meantime, Annah says she better get back to the university to get the rest of this plan in motion.\n\nYou spend the rest of the week more or less taking it easy and mentally preparing yourself for taking another trip. You didn\u2019t envision yourself leaving Klyton like this, but you\u2019re starting to look forward to the idea. Maybe your dick\u2019s not so dumb.\n\nAnnah comes to meet you the day before with a few bags (and Checkers who is still the furry little demon dog that growls at you when she sees you) stating that Nature\u2019s Revenge will be coming tomorrow night along with a few other amateur bard types, but definitely better than the chick spouting shitty poetry on a regular basis. She says word is already spreading around the university and there should be a large crowd.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a all set. As you might have noticed I\u2019ve brought some bags with me, I figured you won\u2019t mind me staying here tonight. It\u2019ll save time.\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cOf course not, but what about Jenny?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh I already told her about the big gathering tomorrow. I told her I\u2019d meet her here and as far as she knows I\u2019m just staying at my boyfriend\u2019s place tonight, which isn\u2019t a lie. Oh shit. I forgot my key to the house to give you.\u201d\n\u201cHardly a problem. I can pick the lock.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so talented. I\u2019ll be so glad when we\u2019re out of this city. I\u2019m bored of it already. Come on, make me less bored.\u201d Annah says and begins caressing and kissing on you.\n\nYou see no reason to decline this request and spend more quality time with Annah for the rest of day (and night).\n\nYou wake up the next day a little later than usual and find Annah going through her bags. You also hear the sound of music and mild revelry in the distance.\n\n\u201cShit, is that the band? Am I late? Fuck I gotta get going!\u201d you say.\n\u201cRelax, Nature\u2019s Revenge isn\u2019t even here yet, that\u2019s just some opening act and it only just started. If you were late, I would have woke you up.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cYeah\u2026still I should get going.\u201d\n\u201cJenny\u2019s not even here yet either. You\u2019ve got time.\u201d Annah says and stops what she\u2019s doing, goes over to the bad and grabs your cock.\n\n\u201cAgain? But\u2026shouldn\u2019t I really get going?\u201d you say.\n\u201cAs I said, you\u2019ve got time. You can skip the foreplay.\u201d Annah says and before you can reply, she\u2019s kissing and getting on top you.\n\nWell no point in arguing with her when she\u2019s like this\u2026\n\nAfter spending even more quality time with Annah (which took longer than you meant to) you\u2019re putting on your pants, grabbing your pack with tools, steeping over Checkers (who has been sleeping most of the time she\u2019s been here) and rushing out the door.\n\n\u201cBe careful, I love you!\u201d Annah beams while lying naked on the bed.\n\u201cYeah\u2026and you stay exactly like that when I return.\u201d You reply and close the door.\n\nYou run past the crowds in the Laughing Devil which are cheering some bard on stage and go outside where you run into three tattooed androgynous looking elves with wild colored hair carrying instruments and exiting a nearby carriage. You\u2019re guessing that this is Nature\u2019s Revenge.\n\nNot really giving a shit about them, you just push past and get in the easily accessible carriage and tell the driver to take you to the university.\n\nEventually as you get close to the destination you get out since Annah\u2019s old home is off campus, not actually on it. When you finally get there, it\u2019s indeed a nice home, but not overly fancy. You\u2019ve probably passed it a few times not really giving it a second look.\n\nAfter a quick perusal of the outside surroundings, you\u2019re guessing the Jenny has already left so you quickly get to work on picking the lock, which is easy for you of course.\n\nYou get inside and immediately head to the location of the safe since you want to be in and out of here as soon as possible. Pushing the bed slightly, you uncover the safe and get to work.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not too complex, but you\u2019re not surprised Annah couldn\u2019t get it open. She never was adept at it, hence why she\u2019s gotten you in the first place.\n\nYou crack the safe and indeed find quite a bit of coin in the safe. You find a couple of small objects that may or may not be valuable though. Seems like Annah thought there was more in there than there actually was, still, it\u2019s not a bust by any means.\n\nAs you finish dumping the contents into your pack, you\u2019re about to check the rest of the house, and that\u2019s when you suddenly hear the front door open! What the fuck!? Did she actually come home already?\n\nYou didn\u2019t even remember to bring your weapons with you since you were in such a hurry, not that you wanted to turn this into a murder in the first place. You figure you got two options at this point, either hide or try to escape out a window.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hide", "result": "You quickly scramble from your prone position and look for a hiding spot. Your hope is you can somehow sneak past Jenny and run out the front door. You run into the other bedroom, which you presume, used to be Annah\u2019s and hide in the closet.\n\nFirst thing you notice is that Annah is leaving a shitload of clothes behind, but then again it would be impossible to pack everything. The second thing you notice is stout wooden hangers one of which you grab as a weapon just in case.\n\nMeanwhile, you hear giggling and footsteps of what sounds like two people rather than just one, and the lower sounding voice of the second voice sounds male.\n\nYou stand in the closet listening to Jenny and whoever the guy is and hear them get closer, though eventually their voices trail off in a different direction and given what they\u2019re laughing and talking about, it sounds like they\u2019re heading towards Jenny\u2019s bedroom, which is a relief to you.\n\nWhen you hear the throes of ecstasy, that\u2019s when you make your move and quickly nip out of Annah\u2019s room, past Jenny\u2019s room and soon out the front door, with nobody the wiser.\n\nYou put a lot of distance between yourself and Jenny\u2019s house and eventually you manage to catch a carriage and go back to the Laughing Devil.\n\nWhen you arrive, the place is the busiest you\u2019ve ever seen. The merriment is even spilling outside a bit. So much so that you notice Klyton Watchmen milling about nearby which makes you a bit nervous. You head inside as fast as you can, fighting through the crowds.\n\nYou see Nature\u2019s Revenge up on stage performing some sort of minor magical act along with one of them playing music. Its very colorful and interesting, but right now you just want to find Annah and get the hell out of here.\n\nYou manage to make it to your room, as just as you do, Annah grabs your ass, scaring the hell out of you.\n\n\u201cHey handsome, you get lucky yet?\u201d Annah remarks holding a drink in her other hand.\n\u201cWhat the fuck! You startled me! And after\u2026nevermind let\u2019s talk inside and do it quickly.\u201d You remark and start guiding Annah inside.\n\u201cAlright, alright, I see you want to get to celebrating again.\u201d\n\nAnnah hands you the drink she\u2019s holding when you get inside.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTo celebrate, I mean you were successful right?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell have a drink then. I mean I know you don\u2019t do it a lot, but I think the start of our new lives is call for it. I\u2019d drink with you, but I think I might have had my limit. Any more and I\u2019ll be dancing naked through the streets! Hey remember that time I nearly did that in Teckleville before you stopped me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah at this point shoves the drink in your hand and takes your pack out of your other hand. She opens it up and smiles.\n\n\u201cHeh, I knew you\u2019d be able to do it.\u201d She says and then kisses you on the lips.\n\u201cHey Annah I\u2026\u201d you start to say before being interrupted again.\n\u201cWait, I know how YOU really want to celebrate\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah begins taking off her clothes and getting on the bed.\n\n\u201cAnnah, I\u2019m trying to tell you, I really think we should get out of here right now. There\u2019s Klyton Militia about outside and it\u2019s a little disconcerting that your friend Jenny came home while I was in the middle of robbing the place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t even see her leave. In fact I thought she was still out there.\u201d\n\u201cWell no, she apparently came home with some guy and I had to sneak out.\u201d\n\u201cNobody saw you right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to worry about, come on lover, I got my own lock that I want your pick in.\u201d\n\nAt this point Annah turns around on all fours and turns her head to the side to give you that \u201cWhat\u2019re you waiting for, start fucking!\u201d look. Without thinking about it anymore, you down the drink in your hand, toss it aside and start to unbuckle your pants.\n\nYou manage to get a few minutes into it and you start to feel woozy. At first you just think that you\u2019re just getting too much of a good thing too fast, but then your vision starts to get blurry.\n\n\u201cThe fuck\u2026shit\u2026\u201d you say and slide out of Annah and fall backwards on the floor narrowly missing Checkers who barks at you, being annoyed that your nearly fell on her.\n\nAs your body goes numb and your vision now starts to darken, you genuinely think you\u2019re dying. You see Annah stand over you and then everything goes black.\n\nLater\n\nYou wake up with a really bad headache. In fact most of your body aches, but you don\u2019t feel very weak and manage to sit up. Sunlight is coming through the window, so it must be daytime and your eyes are certainly feeling it.\n\nYou manage to stand up and through the squinting, you notice a piece of paper on the nightstand. You notice there\u2019s writing on it and after rubbing your eyes a bit; you read it even though you have somewhat of an idea of what\u2019s happened.\n\nAsshole,\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this then I\u2019ve already left the city and you\u2019re awake. I wasn\u2019t sure if I drugged the drink too much, but I took a chance. I\u2019m just glad you decided to drink at all. I wasn\u2019t confident I\u2019d necessarily be able to knock you out by hitting you in the head.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t checked already, you\u2019ll find that I\u2019ve emptied your savings and taken everything you stole from that house you robbed yesterday. I could have ripped you off that first night we spent together, since I found the hiding spot while you were sleeping, but then I wouldn\u2019t have been able to use you one more time would I?\n\nI suppose you\u2019re wondering if I planned all this out, well no not initially. I really was getting ready to move on with my life and leave the city, but running into just presented an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up. Sweet revenge. Revenge that I kept toying with for years and finally had the guts to go through with.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a little surprised that you fell so easily to my charms as well as my lies. I mean there never was a Jenny. That was just some woman\u2019s house I broke into recently and could never get the safe open.\n\nI guess you had more feelings for me than I thought, or maybe I\u2019m just that good. But I hope it\u2019s the first because that means you might be having strong feelings of betrayal right now.\n\nI never forgot that night you threw me out. I never forgave it either. And fuck your lame ass apology you tried to give earlier about it.\n\nHopefully this will give you some sort of taste of what I felt that night and if not, well at least I got your loot.\n\nAnd after all this, you\u2019re still my first love and probably my only because I can\u2019t trust anyone ever again. This is what you\u2019ve done to me.\n\nAnnah\n\nP.S.\n\nDon\u2019t bother going to Hessla to try to track me down, I didn\u2019t go there.\n\nYou sit down on the bed and lie back trying to process all this.\n\nYou got fucked in more ways than one and the worst part, you don\u2019t have anyone to blame but yourself.\n\nYour dick was dumb after all.\n\nYou feel like you should be angrier about this and you are pissed to some extent. Maybe even a little hurt, but small part of you can\u2019t help but admire the fact that Annah pulled your strings so flawlessly. She must have been seething for years and still managed to keep it from you since you really thought she was over it. Some damn fine restraint on her part.\n\nNot much you can do about it anyway at this point. You suppose you could go to Hessla anyway since she might have been lying about not going there, but it\u2019ll be long walk since you don\u2019t even have money for a carriage there, of course that can be corrected pretty quickly.\n\nBut what are you really going to do, if you do find her? Kill her? You\u2019re not going to do that even with as mad as you are, you know damn well you wouldn\u2019t be able to. You\u2019ve never even hit her (except slapping her ass during sex) the whole time you were together and she was bitching at you constantly and arguably that was worse than what she just did to you since it was ongoing.\n\nMaybe she deserved her revenge, maybe you\u2019ve just got a soft spot for her, or maybe you just can\u2019t be bothered. Whatever the case, you won\u2019t be chasing her down.\n\nAs for what you\u2019re going to do, you guess you need to build up your coin all over again. She didn\u2019t take your tools or weapons, so that\u2019s a plus. The whole reason why you were leaving Klyton was to start this new life with Annah. Now that that\u2019s off the table, you might as well stay a little longer. Who knows though, maybe you will leave one day.\n\nYou get dressed and gather your tools of the trade and exit your room ready to get to work.\n\nAs you\u2019re doing so, you run into Hank who is telling his various employees to clean up the mess in the main room with the stage. He sees you and walks over.\n\n\u201cWell I have to say, you came through. Got those elven bitches to agree to perform here once a month. With as many people that were here last night I made more money than I have in a month. Consider your rent lowered.\u201d Hank remarks.\n\u201cOh. Thanks. Told you I\u2019d do it.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHm. Where\u2019s that girlfriend of yours?\u201d\n\u201cAh, she took off. Just wasn\u2019t working out y\u2019know? She bitched a lot.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah I guess I can understand that. Who needs that buzzing in your ear right? Still, she was sweeeet. I bet you had fun with her while it lasted.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cNot as fine as those elven bitches though. Fuck, one of them had lips that could make a man cry and that one was fucking wild let me tell you.\u201d\n\nYou give Hank an odd look.\n\n\u201cWhat elven bitches are we talking about exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNature\u2019s Revenge! The lead singer. She was a fucking beauty. I mean I know elves tend to be pretty, but fuck. I wasted no time in putting the moves on her after their set and she was already giving me head. Fucking hell it was great!\u201d Hank remarks.\n\u201cUhh, Hank, all of them were guys.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Nah, you\u2019re fucking with me.\u201d\n\u201cHank, I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m serious. I mean I know it\u2019s hard to tell sometime with elves, but they were definitely guys. All of them.\u201d\n\nHank\u2019s former happy expression drops and he sits down in a nearby chair with a hand over his mouth.\n\n\u201cHank? You, okay?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2026but\u2026she couldn\u2019t\u2026 I mean I would have known\u2026 by the gods\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I fucked the elf in the ass.\u201d Hank whispers, with his eyes darting around making sure nobody else is listening.\n\nYou nearly have to stop yourself from laughing.\n\n\u201cHow the hell did you not know, if you got that far?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno! I mean I just\u2026I was drunk okay! She or he or whatever wanted to get fucked in the ass and I wasn\u2019t thinking with anything except my dick at that point. Oh shit, I feel sick\u2026\u201d Hank says.\n\u201cYep\u2026thinking with your dick. Gets you into trouble every time. Though I gotta say, hasn\u2019t gotten me in quite the same trouble.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m not gonna say shit. However, I think I\u2019d like my room to be free.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you. Just fuck you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not a free spirited elf.\u201d\n\u201cShhhh! Keep your voice down!\u201d\n\u201cSo free room then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah yeah sure! Just don\u2019t say anything!\u201d\n\u201cSure thing, but how are you going to keep your elf from talking?\u201d\n\u201cFuck. I\u2019m gonna have\u2026shit, I need to talk to her, I mean him, I mean\u2026damnit!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nAs you leave Hank with his dilemma, you think to yourself, things could always be worse.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 23\n\n\u201cHere you go, but Hank you really need to start going easy on this shit. It\u2019s getting a little harder to get. It\u2019s almost as if the Klyton medical school is starting to realize their Numb supply is getting stolen.\u201d You say giving Hank his fix.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just go steal from the hospital?\u201d Hank asks.\n\u201cWell yes I could and I have, but they got their shit a lot more secure. Probably better than some jewelry stores. I start making that place a regular target and the price is going to go up.\u201d\n\u201cUp? You\u2019re already getting free fucking room and board!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re still fucking that elf that you don\u2019t want anyone to know about.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking more about that and I\u2019m starting to think that T\u2019ra\u2019ni is right and I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of who I am. I mean why should I? It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well that fine that you\u2019re discovering shit about yourself. Personally I don\u2019t give a shit, but I\u2019ve gotten very comfortable here and I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t want to pay any fucking rent and if you try to make me, you aren\u2019t going to have to worry about if I\u2019m going to blab about your sexual habits, you just won\u2019t be getting any more Numb. I got other customers and there are always other places I can find to live.\u201d\n\nHank looks a little surprised by your hardened approach on this. You\u2019re not sure why, it\u2019s not like you two are good buddies or something. You\u2019re his fucking dealer and he\u2019s hooked on the shit you can easily get for him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking asshole.\u201d Hank replies.\n\u201cYeah well, be that as it may, this place isn\u2019t doing all that bad since I arrived. I don\u2019t see you starving and besides androgynous elves, you\u2019re swimming in college pussy and getting your drugs. So I say things are going to stay as they are for now.\u201d You say.\n\nHank wants to say more, but he just gives you a dirty look and walks off. With that bullshit out of the way, you head to your free room. Before you even get there, you see a woman lingering in front of the door. She doesn\u2019t look like one of the college crowd that comes here now, or a merchant or possibly a wannabe bard.\n\nShe\u2019s dressed in pragmatic clothing more suited to one skilled of the ways of a rogue. In some ways she looks a little like an older version of Annah.\n\nIn other words, a woman of quality.\n\n\u201cAh, there you are. I was waiting for you and didn\u2019t want to just surprise you by waiting inside your room. You know, you really should get better locks on the door. I\u2019d think someone like you would know better.\u201d The woman remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not usually a problem. Besides, I learned a long time ago that it often doesn\u2019t matter how good the lock, if someone wants in, they\u2019re getting in.\u201d you reply.\n\u201cTrue. I guess you would know. Anyway, I\u2019m Zalmora.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Is that supposed to mean something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, though I know you\u2019ve sold shit to the Bloody Talons in the past, surprised you haven\u2019t heard any of them talking about me in passing. Or more likely bitching about me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have long conversations with Talon assholes. I generally just want them to buy their shit and go murder an old lady or whatever it is they do nowadays. In fact, are they still even around? Last I heard a shitload of them got killed two months ago in a big Klyton militia raid. Including their leader Jake.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the Bloody Talons are indeed no more. Oh sure there\u2019s a couple of them still lingering about trying to keep what\u2019s left of the rabble, but I anticipate that even that will be gone by the end of the year thanks to the militia.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what they get for being so high profile and generally being a bunch of unsubtle idiots. Wait, were you in the Talons?\u201d\n\u201cI was. And it\u2019s all true, they were a bunch of unsubtle idiots. Wasn\u2019t always like that of course when we were the Crimson Talons, but well shit happens. Perhaps that\u2019s how I managed to stay undetected since I was probably one of the few that was still a professional. Kind of like you in that way right?\u201d\n\u201cI guess. So why\u2019d you stay?\u201d\n\u201cLove I guess? I mean Jake was a bloodthirsty asshole that was a terrible leader, but I think he cared about me as much as he understood it anyway. And he had a certain charm, at times.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a true love story. Anyway, what did you want? Are you here to buy or something?\u201d\n\u201cActually I was wondering if you\u2019d be interested in doing a job with me. I\u2019m well aware of your skills and I think it would go a lot easier with your assistance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it would, but I don\u2019t partner with anyone.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? I thought you had a girl you routinely partnered with all the time. Wasn\u2019t she your girlfriend or\u2026oh wait\u2026bad break up?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t reply.\n\n\u201cOkay, I see. Yeah I suppose that might put a crimp in your trust level which is probably low enough seeing our line of work and all.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cNot to mention I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d You add.\n\u201cWell does that matter? I\u2019d argue that familiarity is one of the more minor factors in whether you can trust someone or not. I mean there were a few times in the Talons where apparent friends backstabbed each other.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s a valid point. However, it\u2019s still a factor never the less. I mean just speaking on a professional level, I know I\u2019m good, but I don\u2019t know how good YOU are. I just know you were in the Bloody Talons and given what I knew of most of them doesn\u2019t speak highly.\u201d\n\nZalmora chuckles a bit.\n\n\u201cSomething funny?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah. Never thought MY skills would ever be called into question. That\u2019s good though, means you really are a professional and serious about your work. Look, I\u2019m going to go ahead and tell you what the job is. Kenzer\u2019s Gems and Jewels.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cKenzer\u2019s huh? I just got done telling someone that the Klyton hospital has better security then most jewelry stores and of course now you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re hitting the one exception. Place might as well be a bank. In fact a bank might be easier. Still, you got my attention so you might as well come inside and tell me of this mad plan.\u201d\n\nYou open the door and you both enter where after mentioning something about your room, she goes into detail about the plan.\n\nThe plan is actually surprisingly simple. It\u2019s just a basic break in with more attention on the security and locks. She says that she\u2019s actually been casing the place on and off for a year and even acquired special dwarven thieving tools to help in her task.\n\nHer main concern is possible magic protection which seems like a given and partially asked for your help since she knows your area is the university which also houses the college of magic and was wondering if perhaps you had any access to or perhaps even acquired anything that might bypass such things.\n\nYou explain that you\u2019ve always sort of stayed away from the college of magic despite lurking around there a couple times out of curiosity. You say you\u2019ve toyed with the idea pilfering from there before since it never seemed like the place was any better protected than most of the other parts of the university, but you were always a bit paranoid that you\u2019d pick up something that might just give you a fate worse than death.\n\nZalmora nods at your words.\n\n\u201cI see. Well would you have any problems with me poking about the place?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cWhat the college of magic? No. I mean you don\u2019t need my permission.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, I know I don\u2019t, however I know its in your territory so to speak, I don\u2019t really want to cause any potential problems.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well gotta say, I\u2019m not used to this sort of professional courtesy from anyone before, let alone anyone from the Talons who were often telling ME to get the fuck off their territory whether I was working there or not. In any case, you\u2019ll get no issues from me. Though I\u2019d be careful fucking around in there.\u201d\n\u201cRisks of the trade. I imagine you\u2019d know something of that.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, though I think I make more coin selling the various hospital drugs I steal. If I actually knew how to make the shit, I\u2019d probably just do that instead because its far less work especially since there\u2019s practically no competition. Unless you count the various Green Lotus dealers and they certainly don\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u201cYeah the Talons were once in the drug trade. Not sure why we stopped really. I think the new leader at the time Tom wanted to step away from it since it drew too much heat. Then again Yellow Devil causing addicts to melt would certainly that. Sort of figured when Jake took charge we might get back into it, but still a bit too organized for him I think. Honestly I think he would have just preferred leading a gang that ambushed travellers on the roads.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well he certainly might have lasted longer. You act like a mad dog, you\u2019ll eventually get put down like one.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. However, I\u2019d say staying put and getting too comfortable like a fat lazy cat is likely to get one eventually grabbed by the scruff, put in a bag and thrown in a river.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I feel like that was directed at me.\u201d\n\u201cMore of a warning. Not sure if you realize it or not but security has increased a lot in the city. Granted a lot of that might be the fault of the Bloody Talons making such a mess of things, but the reasons don\u2019t matter. What matters is, things are getting harder for people like us.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that\u2019s the risks of the trade?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s also anticipating getting out of the way of trouble you can\u2019t handle. Not saying that time is now, but it\u2019s coming soon. And this nice comfortable set up you have might all come crashing down even if you\u2019re careful. After all, with the Talons out of the way, attention is going to focus on the next biggest criminals in the city and I\u2019d say you\u2019d fit the bill.\u201d\n\u201cDuly noted. Well if you\u2019re done with your warnings, I have things to do.\u201d\n\nZalmora looks at you and starts to leave, but you can already tell she\u2019s not done talking. Story of your life.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in partnering up?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cWhy are you so interested in partnering up with me? I mean I get some of the reasons that you\u2019ve explained, but this is still pretty damn sudden. I mean there\u2019s still a trust issue here.\u201d\n\u201cWell because as you pointed out robbing Kenzer\u2019s isn\u2019t going to be an easy job and it would probably be better to have an extra pair of eyes and hands around. And\u2026maybe this is going to sound odd from someone you don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re obviously a talented thief and maybe I just like a little social interaction from time to time from another one in our business.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what then? You miss your Talon buddies? I can\u2019t help with that. They were a bunch of idiots and I was never in this to make friends. Unless you\u2019re saying you\u2019re missing your boyfriend. If that\u2019s the case, well\u2026as you\u2019ve gathered I\u2019m not exactly trusting on that front either however I\u2019m not going to say no to a tumble I suppose.\u201d\n\nZalmora sighs at you.\n\n\u201cFine, you\u2019re an asshole like everyone else in this trade then. Thanks for what information you did provide and apologies for wasting your time.\u201d\n\nZalmora at this point turns to leave for real this time and there\u2019s a part of you that wants to stop her, even though you think it might be more trouble than its worth.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let Zalmora go", "result": "No, you went down that road before. Not going down it again especially not with someone you know practically nothing about. And you certainly aren\u2019t going to take the risk of robbing Kenzer\u2019s. There are easier targets, no need to take unnecessary chances.\n\nYou just hope she doesn\u2019t fuck things up for you when she goes poking around the magic college.\n\nYou return to your usual routine.\n\nA couple days later a big explosion is heard from another part of the city. You don\u2019t know what it is until much later. Turns out that it was Kenzer\u2019s jewelry store.\n\nYou eventually get the story of a failed attempt at robbing the store in the night and apparently the one involved died in the explosion. Burned body parts were found amongst the destruction. You can only guess that was Zalmora.\n\nHell of a way to go, but given you didn\u2019t think it was a great idea anyway, you\u2019re glad you decided not to go with her.\n\nOnce again you return to your usual routine.\n\nYear 24\n\n\u201cHank. Hank. HANK!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cHuh, wha?\u201d Hank sputters while waking up and drooling on himself.\n\u2018Here. I got your latest supply of Gray.\u201d\n\nHank fumbles to get the bag a couple times, but eventually he does. He then says something about you know where his safe is and just take the money from there, before he shoves the pills in his mouth.\n\nYou thought he was bad on Numb, but ever since you had to start stealing a poor substitute used mainly on people with the plague, he\u2019s gotten a lot worse. He even offered to blow you for a fix once. It was pretty pathetic.\n\nThe Laughing Devil is barely functioning like it used to anymore. Long gone are the wild parties filled with college types. Now it\u2019s starting to become a hang out for the dregs of the city.\n\nGranted half of the people are your customers, so you\u2019re probably a big part of the problem.\n\nThe bigger problem is it\u2019s not exactly all that great to live at anymore. At one time you were just living here for free because the owner was dependent on you. Now, it\u2019s pretty much acting as a front for your activities since Hank has really fallen behind in running it proper.\n\nNot to mention you\u2019re starting to get paranoid that the whole place might get raided one day. Klyton is just becoming more of a problem to operate in everyday. You start to think that maybe its time to leave.\n\nOf course, you do have a pretty good set up here. If you took more of a hand in cleaning it up a bit, you might be able to continue to go unnoticed. It would be like owning your own inn without having to actually run it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fix up the inn", "result": "You\u2019ve worked too hard and grown too accustomed to your life style here and you\u2019re not about to be scared off. You just need to make some severe changes. The irony that you\u2019re actually going to work hard to keep an inn open isn\u2019t lost on you.\n\nFirst things first, you need to get rid of Hank. The guy is too far gone now to run this place properly and even if you could get him clean, you wouldn\u2019t exactly have a hold over him anymore. In fact, he\u2019d probably start trying to reassert himself again.\n\nWhich means you need someone new to run the place, or at least do all the actual \u201cinn\u201d shit. The problem is Hank hasn\u2019t been able to keep many steady employees ever since his severe downslide. In fact the ONLY person that\u2019s still hanging around with him is Amanda, the awful poet that he was sticking his dick in on a regular basis when you first got here.\n\nYou\u2019re not quite sure why she still hangs around. She doesn\u2019t do poetry anymore and you\u2019re fairly certain she\u2019s not still fucking him either. She\u2019s not even a junkie. As near as you can figure, she\u2019s just living here for free and helping out with keeping the inn running so it doesn\u2019t get shut down and she\u2019s living on the streets.\n\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever talked too much to Amanda before, but today that\u2019s going to change.\n\nYou wait until Amanda is seemingly not busy and then approach her as she\u2019s taking a break.\n\n\u201cAnother hard day of work, am I right?\u201d you say sitting down at the same table.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah.\u201d She answers.\n\u201cSucks how much you have to do around here and you\u2019re practically doing it all yourself.\u201d\n\u201cLife\u2019s tough all over.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but Hank could at least help you out more than he has. I mean it\u2019s his fucking inn and the guy is just letting the place go to shit. I remember when this place was really popular.\u201d\n\u201cWould have been better had that not ever happened. Just made things worse, sort of like you.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been living here for years now and you have never said two fucking words to me before. Now all of a sudden you\u2019re speaking to me? What the hell do you want?\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck\u2019s with the hostility?\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking ruined my life that\u2019s why! YOU were the one that invited all those other poets and musicians to perform here, which showed me, how I don\u2019t even have as much talent as a bunch of fucking college kids. Then on top of everything else you turned Hank into a brain dead zombie and made this place into a damn drug den. So now because I have no other fucking skills whatsoever, I\u2019m stuck here trying to prop up Hank because he\u2019s practically all I fucking got at this point and making sure this place stays afloat, that is if the militia doesn\u2019t raid the place one day soon.\u201d\n\nWell you sort of weren\u2019t expecting that rant. In fact you expected Amanda to be a meek girl with esteem issues, but seems like there\u2019s more that meets the eye. No matter, you can still work with this.\n\n\u201cWell, consider this my way of making amends for troubling you because I\u2019ve come up with a plan that might benefit the both of us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\nYou explain you want to clean this place up since she\u2019s right to be worried about the place getting raided by the militia. You also tell her that she doesn\u2019t need to prop Hank up either since she could easily just run the inn herself seeing as she\u2019s practically doing that now.\n\n\u201cSo wait, are you suggesting that I kill Hank? I don\u2019t think I could do that even if I never had the highest opinion of him to begin with.\u201d Amanda says.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t kill him right away. YOU marry him, THEN you kill him. That way you\u2019ll get the inn without any hassle.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFucking hell, that\u2019s pretty fucking cold. I mean shit, I just don\u2019t have that in me I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cIf you had it in you to blow that sleezy fucker on a regular basis, along with continuing to work a thankless job just for a roof over your head, pretty sure murder shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Besides, just look at the guy. You\u2019d be doing him a favor at this point.\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck you, you\u2019re a fucking thief and drug dealer. You\u2019re in no position to judge me! And I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\n\u201cOkay fine I\u2019ll do the fucking deed. Figured I might have to anyway. Hell I\u2019ll even make it painless. I\u2019ll just give him something lethal and tell him it\u2019ll make him feel better. Boom. Mission accomplished. Then you can just continue running the place with free reign. Does that make it easier for you?\u201d You remark.\n\u201cI suppose, but I still don\u2019t see how this makes things better for the inn. I mean it\u2019s still a drug den.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to take steps to help you clean up the place in that regard. I\u2019ve sort of realized that I started to get lazy and began shitting where I eat. I need to keep my business separate from this place. I\u2019ll try to also get the college crowd back in this place.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. Hate those pretentious fuckers.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well rich kids with coin to waste like to drink so it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s all in this for you again?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like moving and I like living here for free too so I feel that helping you achieve ownership of this place should cover my rent for a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose that\u2019s reasonable. So, I need to get married huh? Never thought it would be under these circumstances. I\u2019m just wondering what priest is going to be willing to do it though. I mean most of those Joachimite fuckers are so puritanical that they might refuse based on Hank being so zonked. And I doubt if Hank will be up to walking to city hall. We might have to dry him out and if we do that, he might not necessarily be in the frame of mind to marry me.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I actually know of a priest who\u2019s perfect for this. So do we have a deal?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? There\u2019s nothing else involved is there? I mean you\u2019re not going to ask for sexual favors are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, hadn\u2019t planned on it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Deal. But I don\u2019t want to know about what you\u2019re going to do to Hank exactly and I want his body taken care of because that\u2019s not something I want any part of.\u201d\n\u201cFine. As I said, I\u2019ll take care of that. Right then; guess I\u2019m off to get the priest and sort all that shit out. The sooner we get this rolling the better.\u201d\n\nWith the first part of your plan in mind, you head to the Welcome Mat where you hope Virgil is still living.\n\nWhen you arrive, you see the place is still the same shithole it\u2019s always been, though it probably isn\u2019t much worse than the Laughing Devil at this point. Thankfully Trobart isn\u2019t around to give you any shit.\n\nYou go to Virgil\u2019s room and knock. When you get no answer, you just pick the lock and open the door. You find him predictably passed out.\n\n\u201cVirgil! Virgil! Get up you old drunk! Got work for you and probably some free booze on top of it.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cHuh? Wha?\u201d Virgil sputters.\n\u201cHm, funny how that bit of information woke you up immediately. Seriously, get up I need you for a wedding.\u201d\n\u201cWazzat? Weddin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cYeah a wedding.\u201d\n\u201cK\u2026wait you gettin\u2019 married to dat girl you run around wit?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019m not getting married at all, this is for someone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh good. Dat girl was a bitch.\u201d\n\u201cHah, yes. Yes she was.\u201d\n\u201cSo who you marryin?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not getting married, I need you to marry two other people. Now enough with the questions and let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cAlright! Alright! Fuck. Dere better be a sizable donat\u2026(hic!) donation fer Joachim.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, there will be, now come on.\u201d\n\nYou help Virgil up off the floor and begin to help him out his room. No sooner have you started doing this when you hear a bunch of noise followed by shouting.\n\n\u201cIN THE NAME OF THE KLYTON MILITIA THIS PLACE HAS BEEN MARKED AS UNLAWFUL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW!\u201d you hear a voice exclaim.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe this. This is exactly what you were working to avoid at the Laughing Devil and you get caught up in a raid upon your return here!\n\nYou immediately drop Virgil and try to run out the back way of the Welcome Mat, but the militia already has that covered as well when several of them bust in the back door.\n\nYou turn to run back the other way, and thanks to a few of the militia being overly enthusiastic about their job, you get a poleaxe to your back and then trampled on by several heavy boots when you fall to the floor. This results in severe head trauma which doesn\u2019t kill you immediately, but you do go unconscious. A coma in fact.\n\nIf someone was a kind soul that was checking, your life might have been still saved by a healing potion or even medical attention. However the militia just assumes you\u2019re just one of the many law breaking casualties and they toss your unconscious body on the cart with the rest of the dead after they\u2019ve taken the living into custody.\n\nYou aren\u2019t unconscious for too much longer however and at some point during the journey to the mass grave they dump you in, your life slips away altogether, sparing you from being buried alive.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Get out now", "result": "Yeah, you\u2019re not taking any chances. You need to get the hell out now.\n\nWhere to go though is the issue. Lacking any other ideas, you suppose you\u2019ll head to Hessla and take it from there.\n\nOne of the problems with being thrifty thief/drug dealer is you\u2019ve got more coin than you can easily carry. Granted you\u2019ve got it hidden in what you believe is a good location, you won\u2019t be able to easily check on it, even if you come back here to transport more of it later.\n\nThat\u2019s going to have to be a concern for later though. You can always steal more coin. You\u2019ve had to start over again before, you can do it again if need be.\n\nYou pack up all your important shit, along with some of your savings and immediately make your way to the carriage station.\n\nThere is a lot of militia milling about when you get there, but fortunately other than a few suspicious glances, you don\u2019t even get harassed. You board a carriage believing that you have no doubt made the right decision.\n\nTwo other passengers board the carriage. A young couple who mostly ignore you since they\u2019re really into each other. From what you can gather based on their conversation in between the kissing they\u2019re running away together due to their parents not approving.\n\nYou nearly laugh thinking back at how Annah fooled that guard when you first got to Klyton with a bullshit story like that. You were probably about the same age as the couple when that happened.\n\nYou still miss her in some ways.\n\nThe carriage ride starts off uneventful and you even feel comfortable enough to get some sleep since you don\u2019t particularly want to watch the couple slop all over one another.\n\nYour sleep is suddenly awakened by a lot of screaming and yelling, a gunshot and then the carriage smashing into something and flipping on its side. You and the couple go tumbling all over the carriage.\n\nYou survive, though a bit banged up. The couple are still alive too, though the man looks to be very dazed with a big gash on his head and his woman is crying over him.\n\nYou soon hear several voices shouting in excitement and getting louder. Doesn\u2019t take long before the carriage door (which is now above you due to how the carriage flipped) opens up and you\u2019ve got someone with a crossbow pointing at you.\n\n\u201cHey lads, we got some survivors! An\u2019 one of dem is a lovely lookin\u2019 young thing! If nothing else, we\u2019re gonna have some fun tonight! Hey you! Don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 move or I\u2019ll put a bolt in yer \u2018ed!\u201d a bandit says before warning you directly.\n\nSoon several of his fellows come and get you and the couple. They grab you first since they rightly seem to believe you\u2019re the biggest threat. You exit the carriage and see some dead horses with bolts in them which no doubt contributed to the carriage crashing. The driver and the extra protector are nowhere to be seen, though you assume were killed before or after the crash.\n\nThe bandits take away all your weapons and your pack. When one of them opens it up, they\u2019re thrilled with what they see.\n\n\u201cFuck, between this and that girl. We hit the mother lode today!\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cIs that right Lou? Let me see what you got that\u2019s so great and why you fucking felt the need to attack without me.\u201d A voice suddenly says.\n\nYou see a female elf wearing next to nothing save for a few tattoos approach.\n\n\u201cHad to Flameflower, opportunity arose and we needed to seize it. And it paid off! Look!\u201d\n\nFlameflower grabs the pack from Lou and looks inside with a nod.\n\n\u201cOkay. Glad you guys didn\u2019t wait until I was done taking a shit then since this seems to have worked out. Hmm, this one\u2019s pretty, almost familiar looking.\u201d Flameflower says giving you a look before being distracted by screams of the girl being pulled out of the carriage by some of the other bandits.\n\n\u201cHaylon! Will you shut that bitch up?! Put a gag in her mouth or shove your cock in it. I can\u2019t hear myself think!\u201d Flame shouts.\n\u201cApologies Flame. Um, what should we do with this one?\u201d Haylon says pointing to the young man who they\u2019re holding up since he\u2019s barely conscious.\n\u201cShit, two young pretties today. Guess Yag\u2019s really rolling well for me for a change. Hm, he looks like he\u2019s almost on his way out. Guess we better do him quick unless we want to add necrophilia to our agenda. Fuck it, might still do that, day\u2019s early. Anyway, let\u2019s get his pants off and I\u2019ll start sucking. Hey have his bitch watch, she might learn something so she can satisfy the rest of you boys.\u201d\n\nThis is some fucked up shit and while you aren\u2019t exactly sure what these fuckers are going to do to you, you are not going to just wait around to find out.\n\nWith as much force as you can muster, you punch Lou in the side of the face while his attention is divided and take off running. This is soon followed by shouts calling for you to be stopped.\n\nSeveral bolts whizz by you and for a moment you think you\u2019re going to get away and then you feel a sensation in your head.\n\nYou immediately see a moment in your youth when you were with your sister, playing and laughing in Teckleville. Such a happy time.\n\nThis vision then blinks away and you fall to the ground twitching a bit as your brain begins shutting down along with the rest of your body due to the bolt buried in your skull.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Stop Zalmora", "result": "You must be getting bored (or lonely) because this is probably a bad idea.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, stop. I\u2019ll help.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey don\u2019t feel the need to pity me, I don\u2019t need or want it.\u201d Zalmora responds.\n\u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m just thinking that I know the college of magic layout better than you and if you\u2019re going to hit that place first then it would probably be best if I came with you. Last thing I need is you getting caught and then security around the university starts getting tighter as well.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, okay.\u201d\n\nZalmora smirks a bit at your response as if she doesn\u2019t quite buy your excuse to help. Though to be fair, your reasoning isn\u2019t totally a lie.\n\nYou go into detail about the layout of the place and what she can probably expect. You tell her that unlike most places its actually better to go there during the day since the wizard types seem to be more active at night. You mention that the while the security isn\u2019t tight, there\u2019s probably a reason for that which is there doesn\u2019t seem to be much just lying around waiting to get snatched. The few times you did lurk about there, all you mostly found within easy reach were a lot of unlabeled potions and spell ingredients.\n\n\u201cI guess it not being secure isn\u2019t entirely true since the upper floors seem magically locked so I never got up there. Also there is the basement level, but uh, I got a few feet down there, heard weird noises and got the hell out of there and never went back. Not going to risk going down there again either. Anyway, when did you want to do this?\u201d\n\u201cI can meet you here in a couple days. Any particular time?\u201d\n\u201cI guess sometime in the morning. It\u2019s a little early for me, but probably best to get started early.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well I\u2019m glad this wasn\u2019t a wasted trip and I look forward to working with you\u2026what changed your mind?\u201d\n\u201cHell if I know. I\u2019m probably being an idiot and thinking with dick again.\u201d\n\nZalmora chuckles.\n\n\u201cSo basically like most guys then. Still, I appreciate the honesty. Alright I\u2019ll see you.\u201d\n\nZalmora takes her leave and you take steps to move most of your savings to another hiding spot.\n\nIn couple days true to her word Zalmora comes to your door.\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m here. Not sure why you wanted me here so early, but I\u2019m guessing you wanted to go over things for tonight.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cTonight? I wanted you here early so we can go early since there\u2019s less activity then.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLess activity? Kenzer\u2019s would be open right now.\u201d\n\u201cKenzer\u2019s? I\u2019m talking about the magic college.\u201d\n\u201cThe magic college? Oh! Fuck, well this is embarrassing that there was miscommunication on our first potential job together. I meant going to Kenzer\u2019s today. I already went to the college of magic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? But I thought you wanted me to go with you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I got the impression you didn\u2019t really want to go and as I said I thought you were talking about Kenzer\u2019s place. Anyway, I got some stuff. Check it out.\u201d\n\nZalmora takes a small pack off her back and goes over to a table and dumps out some of the contents. A few of them are potion bottles, a couple are some sort of odd glowing stones and some sort of silver tube with a hole at the top.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s great, but do you actually know what any of this shit is?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cActually I do! These potions make you invisible!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I drank one and that\u2019s exactly what happened!\u201d\n\u201cYou drank\u2026fuck. Well you\u2019re braver than me, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe not as much as you think. These actually were sort of labeled. Maybe not directly on the bottle, but in a little book nearby where I guess some wizard was making notes on what they were making. Anyway, they don\u2019t last long though and you feel sort of dizzy, even a bit nauseous after becoming visible again. Well at least I did.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, still might come in handy. What about these stones?\u201d\n\u201cThese apparently are some sort of magic explosive. I guess you throw them really hard at something and it explodes. Um, the notebook didn\u2019t exactly say how powerful though.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you had those rolling around in your pack. Great. Okay, so what about the whistle?\u201d\n\u201cOh this? Just some silver whistle I found lying around and looked valuable. Here you go. Consider it your cut for your information.\u201d Zalmora says tossing you the whistle.\n\u201cUh okay. Thanks I guess.\u201d You say catching it.\n\u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t find anything like a magical lockpick, but hopefully Kenzer don\u2019t have any magic locks like I\u2019m anticipating.\u201d\n\u201cWell if worse comes to worst, I guess we could blow up something with those stones and drink the potions as we get away with the loot.\u201d\n\u201cI like the way you think. So\u2026I guess we got a bunch of time. Any suggestions on how to spend it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I got up way earlier than I normally do, so if it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019m going back to sleep. You can see your way out.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t expect that to be your suggestion.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you thought I was going to suggest sex? I already did that once before and you weren\u2019t interested.\u201d\n\u201cYou give up so easily?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just figure if it is going to happen, my chances will increase after a successful job\u2026either that or you\u2019ll double cross me and leave me for dead. It\u2019s a risk either way, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nWith those words, you put your whistle on the end table next to your bed and lay down. Zalmora looks at the door for a moment and then over at you.\n\n\u201cHey you wouldn\u2019t mind if I slept here would you?\u201d Zalmora asks.\n\u201cWhat? Wait. You mean actual sleep right?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cYes. I just don\u2019t feel like going all the way back home, I got all my equipment for tonight\u2019s job and it\u2019s not like I got anything else going on today. Might as well get some rest.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026fuck it. Okay, but where are you expecting to sleep? I\u2019m not giving up the bed in my own place.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to, I\u2019ll just share it. I trust you\u2019ll be a gentleman. Move over.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Zalmora is plopping herself on your bed and nudging you over. You swear, you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on with this woman. She\u2019s being very forward, but holding back at the same time. It\u2019s not quite teasing though. Maybe all of this is some sort of weird way of showing she can be trusted? If so, you\u2019re not convinced.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re planning on robbing me while I sleep, you\u2019ll find I\u2019m a light sleeper and that silver whistle you gave me is probably the most valuable thing in the room now anyway.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it. I\u2019m guessing that ex of yours did something like that?\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cNot talking about it\u2026what\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re all up on me. I mean it\u2019s weird enough that you want to share a bed, now you got your arm and leg on me. A few more moves and we might as well be fucking. I mean if that\u2019s what you want to do, you can just tell me since I\u2019m not sleepy enough to not oblige that request.\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026look, I was just used to sleeping next to a warm body on a semi-regular basis and I miss it. Even if said warm body was an asshole most of the time. So no, I\u2019m not looking for sex, I just want that feeling of closeness I guess. Yeah I know it\u2019s weird, but as you said, it is what it is. So if this is just too much of a cock tease for you I guess I\u2019ll go home and come back later.\u201d\n\u201cNo. no, it\u2019s fine. I guess I get it\u2026but you have to be into me on at least a physical level. I mean surely you wouldn\u2019t be doing this with some bum on the street?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019re right about that one. Just try to keep the groping to a minimum for now.\u201d\n\nAnd with those words, Zalmora closes her eyes and after staring at her a moment, you do likewise. It\u2019s nothing something you normally do, but it is sort of nice. Makes you miss when you and Annah used to do this on a regular basis.\n\nLater you awaken to find that night has fallen and hear the sounds of merriment in the distance. Sounds like another lively night on stage.\n\n\u201cI was just about to wake you.\u201d Zalmora says, going through her pack by candlelight.\n\u201cHow long you been awake?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, the bards and people cheering woke me up a couple hours ago I guess. I thought you said you were a light sleeper.\u201d\n\u201cI usually am. Maybe your body being against mine was just so comforting it lulled me into a deep sleep.\u201d You half joke.\n\u201cHm, glad you enjoyed it. Given your general view on things, maybe you needed just as much as I did. Anyway, you ready to go do this?\u201d\n\u201cYep, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\nYou and Zalmora take your leave and head to Kenzer\u2019s Gems and Jewels.\n\nAn hour later\u2026\n\nAs you\u2019re puking up your guts from the after affects of the invisibility potion, Zalmora is anxiously looking around, hoping none of the Klyton Watch are patrolling the sewers.\n\n\u201cHurry up, I\u2019d rather we put more distance between us and the shop!\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cUgh\u2026don\u2019t you mean smoking crater? That shop is in ruins and I\u2019m amazed I even survived the blast. Pretty sure I got broken glass in my body and I know I\u2019ve got burns because I can still feel the fucking heat from my blackened clothes.\u201d You say trying to regain your composure from your vomiting.\n\u201cApologies, but really didn\u2019t know that was going to happen. I mean the first stone didn\u2019t do anything except make a small pop.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have waited a bit, I was sure I had that lock open. Fuck, whatever. It\u2019s done now. Anyway you alright?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah, I managed to take cover and just got some scraps rather than getting blown out one of the windows.\u201d\n\u201cDid we get anything?\u201d\n\u201cUh, unfortunately I think in all the confusion the bag of gems I had split and everything fell out. I only managed to save a few and not even the more valuable ones. Do you have anything?\u201d\n\u201cYeah a lot of pain. Agh. Fuck, I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, let\u2019s go back to my place. You go into the Laughing Devil looking like that and someone might put two and two together when they hear about what happened. You know how easily people talk. I mean yeah it\u2019s a slim chance, but why risk it?\u201d\n\u201cFine whatever. Just want to get to some place to rest. Just lead the way.\u201d\n\nYou and Zalmora walk through the filthy sewers to her place in relative silence. The pair of you are both keeping an eye out just in case, but you\u2019re fairly certain that despite everything, you go out of there before anyone really saw you, let alone the Watch. Of course who knows what else lurks down here in this place.\n\n\u201cI gotta say, you\u2019re taking all of this better than I thought you would.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little too drained to bitch about how badly it all went. Besides, I didn\u2019t really lose anything I suppose. Which is more than I can say the last time I worked with a partner. I mean I\u2019m still alive and in one piece.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cHeh. If I was working with Jake he would have been yelling and screaming the whole time at me and saying it was all my fault.\u201d\n\u201cWell at least he would have had some basis in fact for bitching. If I had been working with Annah and she had been the one to throw that explosive stone, she would have STILL blamed me for everything and bitched for the next three days.\u201d\n\u201cYikes. I take it Annah was your ex?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, though to be honest we weren\u2019t really together in that way for awhile. We had just been working on jobs on and off until\u2026ah I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m talking about this, it\u2019s not important.\u201d\n\u201cNo, go on. I\u2019d like to hear. Certainly beats just listening to the sounds of the sewers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d\n\nYou go into a little more detail about Annah and what she was like. It\u2019s sort of odd, you\u2019ve never really talked about her to someone else before. Zalmora just listens for the most part, but eventually asking why you were with her.\n\nYour answer is one you\u2019ve gone over in your own head several times before. The only answer you can come up with is \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t. You loved her. Not saying it was the type of love you read about in badly written romance stories with knights saving virginal damsels, but you put up with her and still kept contact with her despite you throwing her out. Which seemed like more of a rash move on your part that you probably regretted later since it sounds like you were even willing to give it all another chance. First loves are hard to shake. I should know.\u201d\n\u201cOh was that the situation with Jake?\u201d\n\u201cHah, no. Jake was\u2026something else, but my first love was when I was younger and well let\u2019s just say it could have ended better.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m definitely over her now.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? I really couldn\u2019t help but notice how you described her physical appearance you kept referring to ME sometimes in comparison. Such as hair, eyes, mouth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Wait. No! I just\u2026uh bad at describing people and couldn\u2019t think of a better way to do it. I mean she doesn\u2019t look like you at all! You\u2019re older! \u2026 Oh fuck\u2026 Shit. I don\u2019t mean it like that. I mean you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCalm down I know what the hell you mean. Please, it takes more than that to offend me. What you\u2019re basically saying is I look like a\u2026more mature version of your ex.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah I guess so. And definitely nowhere near as bitchy.\u201d\n\u201cWell you haven\u2019t gotten on my bad side yet.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be any worse than the relative pleasant side of you considering that side nearly blew me up.\u201d\n\nZalmora laughs at your comment and the pair of you continue to speak all the way back to her home. It actually lightens both of your moods.\n\nZal\u2019s home is humble, but it\u2019s definitely a welcome place to rest after this failed night. You spend a couple days there recovering at Zal\u2019s insistence since the job was her idea to begin with and she feels partially responsible.\n\nYou have to admit, you really feel like this is all a set up for something worse because you haven\u2019t had someone this pleasant with you for quite awhile.\n\nBut there is no other shoe dropping so far. In fact Zalmora makes a comment about supposing that you won\u2019t be working together again given that this first job was a big failure.\n\n\u201cNo. We can try this again. No shortage of other places to blow up after all.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cAh, well that\u2019s true. And we haven\u2019t fucked yet.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cThere is that I suppose.\u201d\n\nZalmora looks at you.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWell what?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou want to get that out of the way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, now?\u201d\n\u201cYou still need time to heal?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think can manage.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get to it then.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026sure about this?\u201d\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t sure, I wouldn\u2019t be suggesting it.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re sure\u2026agh fuck\u2026shit my fucking side\u2026uh you think you can be on top?\u201d\n\u201cPfft, like you were going to have a choice.\u201d\n\nThis looks like the beginning of a brand new partnership\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 25\n\n\u201cThink it\u2019s time to leave Klyton.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cWith the increase in Klyton militia activity in the city? Yeah. Unless you\u2019re thinking about a career change.\u201d\n\u201cAre you thinking about one?\u201d\n\u201cEh, there are times when I think about what else I could be doing with my life, but pretty sure settling down and having a whole mess o\u2019 babies isn\u2019t high on the list. Well certainly not the babies part at least.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not. Kids always grow up to disappoint\u2026well that\u2019s probably what my parents think anyway. In any case, I see no reason to change things up.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well you\u2019re still young. You might change your mind.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it. I mean I can\u2019t see myself really doing anything else other than what I\u2019m more or less doing right now.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think when you\u2019re in your seventies you\u2019re going to be sneaking about in houses and buildings?\u201d\n\u201cAssuming I live that long, I would hope that I will have acquired enough to live on for the remainder of my life by then.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, your thrifty ways. A very atypical trait for someone in our line of work barring a few dwarven thieves I\u2019ve known in the past.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just aware that times may not always be plentiful, so better to have something to fall back on.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very pragmatic. You sure you don\u2019t have any dwarven blood?\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Nah. I mean when I was still working with my sister, I was doing this mostly due to it being fun. Never really spent much of what I stole, hell I even misplaced a bauble from time to time because it just wasn\u2019t important enough that I cared. I mean I could just steal from another travelling merchant right? Then when I was with Annah, I couldn\u2019t even keep most of what I stole without her spending it almost immediately.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I think my short time in an actual relationship with her caused me to always hang on to whatever I managed to keep and in time it just became a habit.\u201d\n\u201cNot a bad habit to have. Most don\u2019t think about the future.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s bringing this all on anyway?\u201d\n\nZalmora exhales and stretches a bit before answering.\n\nZal goes into how when she was much younger she originally was doing this out of survival and the fun came later when she realized how good she was at it. For awhile it was a mixing with business with pleasure sort of thing. However lately she\u2019s been starting to dwell on the future mainly because she\u2019s starting to realize the little aches and pains in her body she feels when running from the militia or her reflexes slowing down as she narrowly avoids a trap she\u2019s disarmed.\n\nYou tell her she\u2019s hardly ready for the grave, which she of course knows that, but each year it becomes something she thinks about more and more. She again mentions that she\u2019s not interested in settling down with dreams of a family or even \u201cretiring\u201d from this life anytime soon, but she would like to have an end game as it were.\n\n\u201cI suppose one of the few benefits of being in a gang was there was a mild sense of community. At least there was when it was the Crimson Talons. More people were around to assist and you could take a break for a while. I suppose at one point I even figured I\u2019d become one of those old members that just sent you young folks on assignments and reap the benefits.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cSo\u2026you saying you want to start a new gang?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHell no. If anything I should have left the Crimson Talons when it became the Bloody Talons, but you know, I was an idiot who thought I was in love or whatever it was. In any case, I\u2019m done with the whole gang part of my life. What I\u2019m doing now is fine, but I know at some point I\u2019m not going to want to do this anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we save.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s at least a plan, though I guess\u2026I dunno\u2026I suppose it might be nice to have steady income without having to risk our lives for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like having a real job.\u201d\n\u201cWell I know neither of us want to do that, but maybe we should consider something that isn\u2019t like a real job, but still mostly legal if we want to stay in Klyton because shit is just getting harder here. Hence why I suggested we might need to get the hell out of the city.\u201d\n\u201cWell any suggestions on where to go? Hessla? Holgard? Delantium?\u201d\n\u201cEh, none of those choices are all that great. The Delantium Kingdom and Holgard both have an Ebony Claw Syndicate presence and as I said before dealing with gang shit is the last thing I want to be doing in my life now. I suppose the best of the lot would be Hessla. It\u2019s close, The Syndicate doesn\u2019t have any real presence there and the law there is non-existent. At least in the traditional sense. The governor of Hessla still keeps a tight reign on things so it isn\u2019t chaos there, so random murders, muggings and burglaries are frowned upon, but say opening up a slave market would be fine provided the governor is getting his cut.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m into selling slaves.\u201d\n\u201cWell obviously I wasn\u2019t suggesting that, but you do sell drugs. You could do that in Hessla without worrying about the legal ramifications.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m not making them. I can\u2019t sell the medical shit I steal from Klyton\u2019s hospitals if I don\u2019t have easy access to it.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe you could branch out. I mean Hessla is a pirate haven, lots of stuff coming in and out of that place. You probably could fence items. People always seeking out things or looking to sell.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like running a pawn shop which sounds like a job\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of it as running a pawn shop, think of it as\u2026running a black market.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Well that does make it sound more appealing. Okay, but surely Hessla already has several such established places there.\u201d\n\u201cWell its called competition. Obviously I didn\u2019t say it would be easy, but it\u2019s an option worth thinking about. And you wouldn\u2019t be doing this alone, I\u2019d be helping you of course.\u201d\n\nZalmora puts one of her hands on yours and squeezes slightly as if to reassure you of her words. Zal isn\u2019t one for a lot of affection, but during your relationship with her you know her feelings are genuine.\n\nNo unnecessary drama either. She comes off a bit \u201cguiding\u201d at times, like she\u2019s doing right now. Still, it\u2019s better than bitching.\n\nYou\u2019re not quite sure about this idea that\u2019s she got though. Still seems a bit too close to having a proper job though she\u2019s probably right about Klyton getting a bit of a hassle to function in nowadays.\n\nYou need time to think about it. Zal said she wasn\u2019t rushing into this anyway and who knows; you or her might come up with a different idea in the meantime.\n\nA few weeks pass and you get news about the militia raiding the Laughing Devil. You\u2019re sort of surprised it took them so long because even before you stopped living there it had started to get a reputation for hosting \u201cindecent acts without a license\u201d and becoming a Green Lotus den.\n\nJust as well that you started living with Zalmora otherwise you might have gotten swept up in said raid. Still, Zal was concerned before and she\u2019s really alarmed now, so much so that she\u2019s urging you both to leave immediately with just what you can carry.\n\n\u201cBut I got a shitload of savings stashed\u2026somewhere. I can\u2019t easily just leave with it right now!\u201d you remark.\n\u201cDo you feel it\u2019s safe? Do you think anyone is going to find it?\u201d Zal asks not even taking offense that you\u2019ve still kept the location secret from her.\n\u201cWell nobody\u2019s found it yet so I think it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cGood, you can come back and get it later then. We need to move now. You sold shit to more than a few of those assholes at the Laughing Devil, the owner in particular. How long before one of them drops your name and the militia tracks you here?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, fuck it. I\u2019ve lost it all before, I can make it all back again if it comes to that. Let\u2019s get packed.\u201d\n\nYou and Zal start packing as much as you can as quick as you can and make your way to the carriage station. You ask Zal if she feels some sort of way about having to abandon her house, but she just replies that it\u2019s not like she\u2019s leaving a mansion and was more or less just a place that she could keep her stuff and a roof over her head. She then mumbles something about thanking her uncle that left it to her and tells you to quicken your pace.\n\nYou get within sight of the carriage station and then you see several patrols of militia walking about the area. A few of them are even walking in your direction. Your instinct is to keep cool and just walk by them as if nothing is wrong since if you run or even turn around at this point it\u2019s going to arouse suspicion.\n\nHowever Zal is already whispering another suggestion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s run now. I know the closest manhole and we\u2019ll lose them in the sewers.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Walk by the militia", "result": "You suddenly start running and they\u2019re definitely going to know something is up. Better to just play it cool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, we just need to keep calm.\u201d You say continuing to walk towards the station.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, we need to run.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine, just stop talking.\u201d\n\nYour visible minor disagreement with Zal has already caused enough suspicious however by the militia approaching who were looking for an excuse anyway.\n\n\u201cYou two halt!\u201d one of them remarks.\n\nAnd as soon as that\u2019s said, Zalmora has taken off running.\n\n\u201cZal! Shit. Fuck\u2026\u201d you sputter as you realize you now have no choice but to follow suit. Of course this split second of confusion combined with how close you let them get in the first place is unfortunately just enough for the militia to catch you.\n\nNaturally, they slam you to the ground and begin disarming you. Nearly literally since they break one of your arms in the process. Next step is taking away your backpack and once they see what\u2019s inside, if there was the slimmest chance that they might still let you go, it\u2019s gone.\n\nYou actually expect them to just kill you right then and there, but they end up dragging you to the Klyton jail where they lock you up.\n\nYou spend about a week inside still suffering from a broken arm. You keep holding out for the false hope that maybe Zal is going to pull off some daring rescue, but that doesn\u2019t happen. She\u2019s gone and while there\u2019s a part of you that is very angry about it, you\u2019re more mad at yourself for not running when she suggested it in the first place.\n\nYou probably could pick the lock even with a broken arm, but you wouldn\u2019t get far. The only upside is you\u2019ve got a cell all by yourself while its decided on if they\u2019re going to do anything worse to you.\n\nA month passes and finally a Captain Branik, head of the militia tells you that you\u2019re going to be executed.\n\n\u201cWhat?! I can\u2019t even defend myself? You didn\u2019t even arrest me committing a crime!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to defend? When we caught you, you had a shitload of coin and other valuables. You obviously have no visible means of support and you were trying to leave the city. Doesn\u2019t take a scholar to put everything together. Shit, we even got reason to believe you were involved in blowing up Kenzer\u2019s jewelry store and found a silver whistle that someone in the wizard\u2019s college reported stolen years ago. You\u2019ve obviously been very busy and good at keeping a low profile. Well Yag\u2019s dice have finally rolled snake eyes for you and you\u2019re finally going to pay the price.\u201d Branik says.\n\u201cLook even if I was guilty of whatever you think I\u2019m guilty of, can\u2019t you just exile me? I mean I was leaving anyway. I won\u2019t come back!\u201d\n\u201cExile? We rarely do that anymore. That doesn\u2019t teach anyone shit and it\u2019s going to just let a criminal free to attack caravans on the road. Yeah, not risking that. Shit, I wouldn\u2019t even risk putting you in one of those hanging cages we got. You\u2019d probably pick the lock and get away with all your experience. No, the best thing we need to do with you is make an example. You\u2019ll be hanged tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. No defense, no escape, no anything.\n\nYou sit down and feel sick. It\u2019s weird, you\u2019ve been in other situations where death could have found you, but something about waiting for it in a cell makes it feel worse. Probably because you have time to think about it.\n\nYou can\u2019t think about though, you\u2019ll just make yourself more upset. Instead you try to think about your family oddly enough. You think back to the happier times you had in Teckleville and you think about how you wish you never had to leave.\n\nYou don\u2019t get much sleep and when they wake you up to get you, you\u2019re very tired.\n\nBut not without some fight left.\n\nThe guards come in to get you and you immediately try to fight with one good arm. Naturally you don\u2019t do very well, though you were really hoping that they\u2019d at least kill you right there, but instead they just beat the shit out of you and break your other arm before dragging you to the gallows before an enthusiastic crowd wanting to see their entertainment.\n\nYour body is in so much pain from the broken bones and beatings that when you feel the noose slip over your neck you\u2019re just glad this will be over soon.\n\nSome militia asshole goes on about justice for a moment until you manage enough strength to tell him to shut the fuck up and just get on with it.\n\nThe hooded executioner soon grants your wish and pulls the lever. Your neck snaps almost instantly as you go through the trap door.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run to the sewers", "result": "With as many militia fuckers that are around the station, it might be best to run while you can. You give a look at Zal and nod, then the pair of you turn around and start walking away fast. One of the militia shouts at you both to stop which then leads to you both running; this is then followed by them chasing you.\n\nRunning with a full pack on your back is never a fun thing, but its not like you haven\u2019t done it a few times before. Desperately prying a manhole cover off while trying to escape the law is even less fun.\n\nThe worst of course is stomping about in the sewers. You didn\u2019t like it the first time you did it. Fortunately Zal is still more familiar with them than the militia is and after lying low in some unknown corner of these marvels of sanitation eventually you lose them altogether.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting out of this city the conventional way.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cScaling the wall is going to be a little tough. Probably would still be easier to sneak out one of the gates.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be even easier to sneak out of the city using these sewers. There\u2019s an old passage the Talons used to use to get in and out of the city sometimes. I just hope it hasn\u2019t been completely blocked off since the militia took them out.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised the Talons didn\u2019t use it to escape.\u201d\n\u201cA few of them might have for all I know, but when the militia stormed the hideout, some of them came through that route to make sure nobody escaped that way. I\u2019m just glad I happened to be pissed at Jake at the time and wasn\u2019t around when any of it happened.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well it\u2019s not something I like to dwell on too much. The whole last time we spent time together being angry with him and all. It\u2019s in the past anyway and right now getting through the present is more important. Come on.\u201d\n\nEventually you get to the tunnel that Zal was speaking about and it has indeed been blocked off, however it hasn\u2019t been blocked in a manner that would be impossible to get through as only a set of iron bars along with a few iron gates with locks on them have been installed.\n\nYou and Zal get to work on opening them and eventually you pop them all and soon you\u2019re making your way out to the great outdoors and more importantly those awful sewers.\n\n\u201cFucking hell, never thought I\u2019d be so glad to see the countryside again. I don\u2019t know how the hell you dealt with those sewers on regular basis.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYou get used to it. You get used to a lot of things\u2026anyway I guess we\u2019re walking to Hessla now.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be fun. How long will that take?\u201d you say.\n\u201cA few days I imagine. Uh, you got food and water?\u201d\n\u201cI got some water. I don\u2019t think I have any food. Not exactly a hunter either.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll just eat when we get there.\u201d\n\nYou and Zal begin to walk west towards your destination. As you put more and more distance between you and Klyton, you have a myriad of thoughts running through your mind though some of those are surprisingly about your family. You briefly wonder how they\u2019re all doing. You imagine your mom and dad lives are a lot easier without you around anymore. As for your sister, you hope she\u2019s doing a lot better than you are right now.\n\nYou weren\u2019t sure about \u201cstarting over\u201d before, but it looks like you\u2019ll be doing it whether you want to or not. New town, new possible \u201cprofession\u201d, you\u2019re not exactly looking forward to all of it.\n\nThe only good factor in all this is Zalmora who has been by your side pretty solidly since you partnered up with her. You certainly have a great deal of feelings for her as well, and yet\u2026\n\nYou still don\u2019t fully trust her.\n\nYou don\u2019t know why\u2026 well you do know why; it\u2019s what happened with Annah. Zal has never given you any reason to not trust her, but then Annah didn\u2019t give you any reason either for years.\n\nAs you struggle with this minor conundrum, you suddenly call out to Zal.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Zal replies.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about where I keep my secret stash.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. I wasn\u2019t fussed about it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean it\u2019s not right. You\u2019ve been there for me since we started our relationship and I\u2019m still mistrustful of you when I shouldn\u2019t be. I mean shit, I haven\u2019t even told you I love you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026yeah. Of course I do.\u201d\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound sure.\u201d\n\u201cI do!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I mean I haven\u2019t said it to you either.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I know you do.\u201d\n\u201cOh. You KNOW that. How?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026because\u2026you know! I mean you show it all the time. Just all the stuff you do.\u201d\n\u201cThere are lots of people that will standby you for various reasons, even the right ones. Doesn\u2019t prove anything. I would think your own past experience would confirm that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well\u2026I can\u2019t worry about every detail. Sometimes you have to roll the dice and hope Yag lets you roll a seven.\u201d\n\u201cSo throwing caution to the wind and leaving it to the gods huh?\u201d\n\u201cSeems like it.\u201d\n\nZal at this point gives you a kiss and mentions how glad she is that she met you.\n\n\u201cSo about my secret stash\u2026\u201d you start to say.\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t need to tell me. I already know where it\u2019s at.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said I wasn\u2019t fussed. I already knew its location.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re just now telling me?\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019d told you before, you would\u2019ve freaked out like you\u2019re doing now, thinking I was going to rob you and then you\u2019d have to go find a new spot and it would have put unnecessary work on you, especially since where you did hide it was a very good spot anyway and not likely to be found. Well not unless you\u2019re me. Besides, even if you had moved it, I would have just found out again.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t answer this revelation from Zal. It\u2019s a bit concerning, well a lot concerning really. On one hand it shows that when it comes to your significant others you\u2019re really shit at hiding anything from them. On the other it shows Zal\u2019s been keeping secrets as well, though maybe that isn\u2019t too surprising.\n\n\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t look like that. I told you just now didn\u2019t I? Besides, if I wanted to rob you I would have done it sooner.\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that one before. So what did you do? Follow me?\u201d You respond.\n\u201cYep. I wanted to have my own back up plan in case you turned out to be an asshole like Jake or worse. Wasn\u2019t putting myself through that again.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cBut you weren\u2019t. Or at least not one to me. So it all worked out and we\u2019re still together.\u201d\n\nPart of you considers that you should really rethink your relationship with Zalmora, but after a moment\u2026\n\n\u201cFuck it. Not going to stress about this. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be easy for anyone to get to now at this point. Just hope its safe in the time when we can go back and get it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShould be. We\u2019ll come back in a month or so with a small wagon and go through the sewers and pick it up. That building you hid it near has been abandoned for as long as I\u2019ve been alive in Klyton. Nobody ever seems to bother with it. The city has never had any plans to turn it into something else, nobody else has ever bought it, hell even bums don\u2019t even squat in it. It\u2019s almost like its cursed. Any particular reason why you picked it?\u201d Zal says.\n\u201cEh, my family used to own the place. Ran it as an inn. My dad even worked there while he was trying to complete college.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Well that\u2019s\u2026wait\u2026what the hell is that?\u201d\n\nYou hear the same noise and both you and Zalmora turn your attention towards the wooded area to the left and draw your flintlocks.\n\nSeveral scruffy looking individuals jump down from the trees with weapons in hand. The one who seems to be the leader is an elven woman with face paint and a wild hairstyle and steps forward with a crossbow in her hands. While you\u2019re about ready to fire, Zalmora actually stops you.\n\n\u201cFlameflower. Didn\u2019t know you survived the last raid on the Bloody Talons\u2019 hideout.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cYeah, well my sister didn\u2019t.\u201d Flameflower retorts focusing her attention solely at Zal and moving slowly forward towards her. You keep your own firearm focused on Flameflower, though the rest of her people are also stepping forward and it\u2019s looking grim.\n\u201cSorry to hear that. Sunshine was always friendly towards me.\u201d\n\u201cShe wanted her face in your vertical smile. Where were you during that raid?\u201d\n\u201cI was on a job.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, a job. Always seemed a little convenient that YOU weren\u2019t around when the shit went down.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying Flame? You saying I ratted on the Talons?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. You always acted like you were too good for the gang most of the time.\u201d\n\u201cI was putting in more work for the gang than most were. I was also in it before you even joined. So don\u2019t act like I wasn\u2019t a true Talon or whatever you\u2019re implying. And I certainly wasn\u2019t a fucking rat.\u201d\n\u201cOh you were putting in work all right. You were fucking Jake. Never did understand what he saw in you. I had far more in common with him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? The heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and it obviously got him killed.\u201d\n\u201cNo, being an overly violent reckless idiot is what got him killed.\u201d\n\nFlame is now very close to you and Zal. In fact probably idiotically so. You\u2019d easily blow her face off at this range, even Zal would probably get off a shot before Flame unleashed her crossbow. Flame would have been more dangerous if she\u2019d stayed further back and just ambushed you from the trees.\n\nFlameflower turns her attention briefly towards you.\n\n\u201cSo who\u2019s this one trying to look dangerous? Jake\u2019s replacement?\u201d Flame asks.\n\u201cSomething like that. He does look dangerous doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cPfft. He looks like he should be working in a brothel servicing aging women that are trying to desperately hang on to their youth. But then again, I guess that\u2019s what he\u2019s sort of already doing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well we can\u2019t all have elven blood in our veins to help to assist in halting the aging process halfbreed. You want to talk about desperately hanging on to youth, look in a mirror, since last I remember you\u2019re about a decade older than me and you\u2019re still hanging out with people that could be your children. Look at you, running around half naked in the trees like some fucking savage. Is this what you\u2019ve been doing since the Talons were put out of business?\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? I finally decided to embrace my elven heritage completely and live wild and free.\u201d\n\u201cWell it definitely is you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is me, isn\u2019t it? So, what are you and your pretty manservant doing outside Klyton?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d\n\u201cWell did you want to go back to our camp and tell me all about it? Could certainly do with some new anecdotes other than the ones these assholes talk about over and over.\u201d\n\u201cSure. We could probably do with a rest after recent events.\u201d\n\u201cZal?\u201d you say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not in any danger, well not in any more danger than we were in Klyton anyway.\u201d Zalmora says.\n\u201cYeah, lighten up pretty boy. We\u2019re not killing you. Might still kill Zal if she pisses me off enough, but you\u2026yeah I\u2019d definitely have plans for you\u2026\u201d\n\nFlameflower at this point makes an obscene gesture with her fingers and tongue. You aren\u2019t quite sure how to react to being harassed like this. Zal just shakes her head and rolls her eyes at Flame\u2019s advances towards you.\n\n\u201cFlame is a lot of talk. Just stay close to me, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d Zalmora says with a smirk.\n\nDespite her earlier threats and hostile demeanor, Flameflower is relatively cordial towards Zalmora for the remainder of the night at her camp. She explains to Zal that after she escaped she decided to take up the life of a bandit and along the way she\u2019s managed to acquire a new gang though they don\u2019t really have any official name. She also says that while they operate around Klyton, they often move around a bit in case the militia starts sniffing around.\n\nZal reveals a bit about your own situation with the militia and the situation within Klyton. Flameflower just nods and says it sounds like she\u2019s better off out here. She even offers Zal to join her gang.\n\n\u201cNah, sort of done with the whole gang thing Flame, but thanks anyway.\u201d Zal remarks.\n\u201cBah, still think you\u2019re too good for the rest. Whatever. So, what about you pretty boy? You apparently like older women and I can tell you I got way more experience than Zal here. Make you feel things you didn\u2019t even know you had senses for.\u201d Flameflower says with the same predatory gaze she\u2019s had the whole time.\n\u201cUm, no I\u2019m good.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYour loss. You know\u2026you look familiar. Like someone I briefly knew when I was a lot younger. I used to work at an inn with my sister as a waitress for a while. Mom thought it would instill some sense of responsibility in us. (Snort) Mom was an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cHow odd. I was just telling Zal here about how my family used to own an inn in Klyton.\u201d\n\nFlameflower suddenly slaps her leg and points at you.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! There was a guy and his mother that used to run a place called the Traveler\u2019s Inn. You look like him. He married some other waitress that worked there. Sort of a quiet girl. Always thought she was a bit prissy. I think her name was\u2026Elsa?\u201d\n\u201cEliza. That\u2019s my mom.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I can see that. Though you look more like your father. Hrm. Small world it seems.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cWell if neither of you are interested in joining, you two are still welcome to rest here until morning. Consider it my rare courtesy towards an old gang acquaintance who my dead dear sister had a minor crush on and the eye candy who I\u2019d have my legs wrapped around if this situation was a bit different right now.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well we appreciate it Flame.\u201d Zalmora responds.\n\u201cAnyway, you guys want any dwarven ale? We got several barrels of the shit and nobody here likes it. Not even sure why we took it really. I think one of these idiots said it might be valuable, but hell if I know where to unload it. I mean we\u2019re fucking bandits, we aren\u2019t exactly in the business of trading much of what we take.\u201d\n\nYou and Zal look at each other.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know Flame, we\u2019re thinking about starting up a new business in Hessla, If you hang on to that ale for just a bit longer, I think we might be able to get you something in exchange for it.\u201d Zal says.\n\nThis new business isn\u2019t exactly going to be the type of work you\u2019re used to, but maybe this new phase won\u2019t be too bad. You suppose you\u2019ll soon find out though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 27\n\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re going to be fine going to see Flameflower and her gang of reprobates by yourself?\u201d you ask Zalmora.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be more than fine. Flame\u2019s been overjoyed to have someone that can get various supplies for her on a regular basis, so she\u2019s probably been friendlier with me than she was in the Talons. We\u2019ve also been doing well with our dealings with her. I think she\u2019s actually starting to get organized. She\u2019s got that permanent hideout now and actually came up with a name.\u201d Zalmora remarks.\n\u201cOh? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Flame Blades, though I think it\u2019s a work in progress. Anyway, I\u2019ll probably be gone a few days. According to the badly written note she sent, she\u2019s managed to snag a lot of shit and as usual she\u2019s just piled it all up in corner since she doesn\u2019t have any immediate use for it. Hopefully some of it is actually valuable, but she hasn\u2019t disappointed yet.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Be careful.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I will, but if you\u2019re really worried about me, you could go in my place. I\u2019m sure Flameflower would be happy to see you. You might even get us a discount if you were willing to go that extra step.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. Pretty sure if that happened, Flame would just keep me as her sex captive and you\u2019d leave me with her as revenge for fucking around on you in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cOh, only for a year, then I\u2019d trade some elven wine for you or something.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to see I\u2019m in such high demand. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold things down here.\u201d\n\u201cGood, oh and try not to get into another argument with Lorenzo from Little Lorenzo\u2019s while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\u201cThat fucking Halfling has been an asshole since we opened up shop here. Keeps blaming his financial problems on us and I\u2019m not putting up with him going trying to bad mouth us to potential customers.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s been completely ineffective in that endeavor. Why? Because he\u2019s a fucking Halfling and unless it\u2019s food, nobody fucking pays attention to shit they got to say. If anything, when you went over and started breaking his windows you drew more attention to his shop\u2026as well as the Governor\u2019s Headsmen. Let\u2019s try to avoid that again.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll try to keep that in mind.\u201d\n\nZalmora kisses you goodbye and takes her leave and you\u2019re left to your own devices.\n\nSo far your time in Hessla has been okay. Though you\u2019re still getting used to the idea of having a job despite what Zal says.\n\nSure you\u2019re dealing in a lot of stolen goods and you\u2019ve done that before on a smaller scale, but you still have been missing the whole hands on approach to how you used to do things. Then again life has been a lot easier and could be a lot worse.\n\nAs the day passes you get the usual routine. Selling a few used muskets here, taking in a few exotic vases there, coin given and coin received. The usual.\n\nAs you\u2019re taking stock of some of the items you have in the store, you briefly look when you hear the door open. You see a woman dressed in traveller\u2019s clothing with an eye patch over her left eye walking in with a bag over her shoulder and a little dog by her feet.\n\n\u201cHey, no anim\u2026wait a minute\u2026Annah?\u201d you say.\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah\u2026it\u2019s me.\u201d She replies a bit meekly.\n\nPart of you can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re seeing her again, another part of you sort isn\u2019t surprised. By the same token, part of you wants to go over and strangle her, while a small part of you wants to go over and hug her.\n\nShe walks further into the store with a minor limp. Her dog, which you presume, is still Checkers, follows closely and is still about the same size the last time you saw the infernal furry beast.\n\nWhile you\u2019re feeling a lot of emotions right now, one of the reasons why you aren\u2019t acting on any of the negative ones is the condition she\u2019s in. Eye patch, limp, if she had a hook, she could pass for one of the pirates in Hessla as this point. When she gets closer, you notice scars around her neck. Like either someone unsuccessfully tried to slit her throat or tried to hang her.\n\n\u201cAnnah\u2026what the fuck happened?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2026I fucked up.\u201d Annah responds.\n\u201cWell obviously.\u201d\n\u201cCan I sit down a moment?\u201d\n\u201cSure go ahead. I was getting ready to close down for the day anyway.\u201d\n\nAnnah finds a chair and sits down putting her bag on the floor. When she does, its almost as if some of her burdens have been lifted, if only for a moment. Checkers curls up next to one of her feet. As you\u2019re locking up, you\u2019re just having a hard time believing it\u2019s actually her.\n\n\u201cWell I guess I wouldn\u2019t blame you for laughing at me right now.\u201d Annah responds.\n\u201cLaugh? Annah, this is fucking tragic seeing you like this. I mean\u2026fuck sure I was pretty angry with that stunt you pulled, the last time I saw you. Even briefly thought about chasing you down, but even I certainly wouldn\u2019t have done this to you. Shit, I didn\u2019t even wish this on you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh\u2026I guess I always knew that despite everything you\u2019d still have some feelings for me. I suppose that\u2019s why I came to find you. You know I tried Klyton first. Had a hell of a time finding out you had moved here. Not surprised you finally moved given how strict things have gotten in Klyton. However, I am surprised to find you running a store of sorts.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, things change.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. I\u2019m guessing the woman I heard you were with was one of the reasons for that change. Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019m not here to mess that up. Actually I\u2019m glad you found someone because it\u2019s certainly hard being by yourself. Wish I\u2019d realized that sooner. Is she here?\u201d\n\u201cNo. If she were, we might not be having this long of a conversation. Which brings me to the point of this visit. Now I still don\u2019t know what happened to you, but obviously, you sought me out so I could help you in some way. So what is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well Zalmora isn\u2019t going to be back for awhile, so start talking.\u201d\n\nAnnah tells you that soon after your \u201cparting of ways\u201d she went to the Delantium Kingdom. She says that she lived pretty well there, but it all started to fall apart when she got involved with the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\n\n\u201cBy the gods, why the hell would you do that for?\u201d you utter.\n\u201cI thought I was smart enough to handle them. Of course if I was really smart I would have left Delantium as soon as one of them approached me with their propositions.\u201d Annah answers.\n\nAnnah goes on about how she dug a deeper and deeper hole for herself with the Syndicate until finally they began to lose patience with her and before she could disappear, they caught her and it wasn\u2019t good.\n\nShe tells you that in the scheme of things she got off light since the others directly involved in the plan weren\u2019t so lucky. She was just considered loosely connected so managed to keep her life. However, she says you\u2019re not seeing the scars she has on her back where they also whipped her. It was by the luck of Yag that one of the Syndicate members was such an animal lover that he didn\u2019t kill Checkers as part of the \u201clesson.\u201d\n\nAfter the debt was paid in blood and what little coin she had, she left the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnd then you came to find me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I actually thought about going home to Teckleville, but despite everything I wasn\u2019t completely ready to admit defeat and live some boring life. In fact, that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nAnnah at this point takes her bag and gives you it. You look at her and you slowly open it.\n\n\u201cBy the gods...\u201d You utter.\n\nYou put your hand inside the bag and pull out a fist full of vials filled with Blue Dream. The entire bag is full of them. There must be a small fortune here.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of fucking Blue Dream, Annah. You realize how much fucking Blue Dream you got here?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly, no. Do you know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, but it\u2019s a fucking lot.\u201d\n\u201cCan you give me a fair price? I understand you need to make a profit.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, I\u2019m not a fucking Blue Dream lord! I mean sure I sold some medical shit back in Klyton, but this is a whole different situation.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cFirst off, I\u2019m sure you realize that Ebony Claw Syndicate has domination on this product. They\u2019re very fucking protective of it. I mean if you\u2019re caught selling this shit and you\u2019re not ECS, they will take it out on your ass.\u201d\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t Hessla free of ECS influence?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still come here. I start selling this shit in Hessla and I\u2019ll have a Syndicate hit squad on me before the Governor\u2019s Headsmen can do shit about it. Which brings me to the second point. The Governor of Hessla has a shaky relationship with the Syndicate. If anything causes that tenuous peace to start going south, he\u2019s going to take steps to correct it. And if that means turning over the troublemaker to the Syndicate, then that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cNo way to do it quietly?\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, I could be as careful as possible and some idiot would blab. All it takes is one damn junkie. The only other option is to sell it all in one sale to minimize the risk, but I have no knowledge of anyone that needs that much Blue Dream and has the coin to buy it. Annah, this is REALLY dangerous to even have this in your possession. You have to know that.\u201d\n\u201cI know I only got one fucking eye, a leg that has a permanent limp and deep scars on my back now thanks to the damn Syndicate. I might not be able to do anything to them, but I\u2019m getting something out of them. They don\u2019t know anyway. As I said, they thought the Blue Dream was lost by one of the other poor sons of bitches they killed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you just happened to have it hidden somewhere the whole time of course.\u201d\n\u201cI had a back up plan. I always do.\u201d\n\nYou rub your eyes and shake your head. Annah looks at you with her one good eye and realizes that she may have assumed too much.\n\n\u201cAlright. I can see you can\u2019t help me. It\u2019s okay. I get it. You got a nice life and don\u2019t want to fuck that up. Thanks for at least hearing me out for old times sake.\u201d Annah says.\n\nAnnah goes to take the bag, and that\u2019s when you stop her.\n\n\u201cHang on. Didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t help you. Though I\u2019m wondering why I should\u2026(sigh) fuck it. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019m greedy, because if it\u2019s because I still having feelings for you, I truly am an idiot. I got an idea of how I can unload this. Letting you know right now however, I\u2019m taking full advantage and bending you over good on this deal.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou going to kiss me and tell me I\u2019m still pretty at least?\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cOf course. No reason I can\u2019t still be a gentleman.\u201d\n\nYou tell Annah to wait and you head to the back of the store where your living quarters are and then go to your personal safe where you take out the remainder of what savings you have left. It\u2019s still not as much as what the Blue Dream is worth, but as you already told her, Annah\u2019s going to have to be satisfied with the deal.\n\nYou come back and find Annah petting Checkers in her lap. You then hand her a new bag of loot, which Annah looks in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best I can do Annah.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThis will do. I can take this and easily make more with it, if need be. Learned a few gambling tricks while in Delantium. Um, this isn\u2019t going to fuck up things with your new girl is it?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cZalmora? Eh, I think I\u2019ll be able to talk my way out of it though. Hope so at least.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t tell her then.\u201d\n\u201cHah. She\u2019d figure out I was hiding something and I\u2019d just get into more trouble. If I\u2019ve learned anything, I\u2019m shit at deception when it comes to those I happen to be intimate with.\u201d\n\u201cWell give me the Blue Dream back, I don\u2019t want to cause you unnecessary trouble. I did enough of that when we were together.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I used all my savings rather than the store\u2019s anyway. So while she\u2019ll probably call me an idiot and ask if I fucked you or not, that\u2019s probably where it will end, then we\u2019ll figure out who we can sell the Blue Dream to and get rich.\n\u201cWait, this is ALL your savings?\u201d\n\u201cYep. You\u2019ve got it all again. Just think, you didn\u2019t even have to steal it this time.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know, I\u2019m really sorry about that. I wish\u2026\u201d\n\u201cForget it Annah. It was a long time ago and I got over it.\u201d\n\nAnnah puts Checkers down and slowly stands up. She briefly smiles and moves towards you.\n\n\u201cI\u2026wish things had been different.\u201d Annah says getting a bit of a quiver in her voice.\n\u201cThings are what they are. No point in dwelling on them now.\u201d\n\nAnnah looks down and nods. She sniffles and rubs her eye.\n\n\u201cJust, take care of yourself okay? And for fuck\u2019s sake don\u2019t have anymore dealings with the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t and I won\u2019t forget this either.\u201d\n\nAnnah suddenly moves in quick and gives you a kiss you on the lips.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still my first and only love. You always will be.\u201d Annah says and then turns around to exit the shop. She limps as quickly as she can with Checkers faithfully following her.\n\nAnd she\u2019s gone again.\n\nIt\u2019s still a little unreal to you and you even get a little emotional after your encounter with Annah.\n\nAfter composing yourself, you focus on what she left you with, namely a shitload of Blue Dream. Despite what you told Annah, you\u2019re not really sure how you\u2019re going to get rid of it with ease. Zal will probably have some ideas, though you\u2019re dreading the conversation you\u2019re going to have to have with her. Fortunately you\u2019ve got a few days to prepare yourself.\n\nA few days pass and Zal still isn\u2019t back yet. When two more days pass after that, you stop worrying about your conversation with Zal and just start to worry in general. Your worries are soon answered when a little boy suddenly comes running in your shop that day with a note saying someone on the edge of Hessla gave him this message to give to you.\n\nPretty boy,\n\nBring ALL your shit now or the bitch dies.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFlameflower\n\nYour heart sinks and you feel sick. At first you wonder why Flame is doing this since your \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d with her and her gang was always positive.\n\nThen again, does it matter what the reasons are? She\u2019s a fucking violent criminal and the risk was always there. The important thing is she\u2019s holding Zal hostage and you have to do something about it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Comply with the note", "result": "You\u2019re not some hardened bandit. In fact, you\u2019ve probably gotten a little out of shape due to your less strenuous life. You are not going to be able to just go in Flame\u2019s camp and take everyone out like some warrior priest of Karn.\n\nYou\u2019d just get yourself and Zal killed at best if you tried to save her. Granted that could happen anyway, but you\u2019re hoping that if you grovel enough, it\u2019ll appeal to Flame\u2019s ego enough that she\u2019ll be amused enough to let you both go. It\u2019s not going to be fun, but if it\u2019s what is going to get the job done then so be it.\n\nYou go to the store safe and empty it all out. You hope it\u2019s enough since it\u2019s been a slower month this month. You also wish you hadn\u2019t given away your own savings to Annah since you probably could have used it assuming you get out of this. You guess you really will be selling Blue Dream for a while.\n\nIt then occurs to you that maybe you can use it as extra bargaining. You decide to take a couple vials in the hopes that you can convince Flameflower, you can get her a lot more of the stuff if she doesn\u2019t kill you or Zal.\n\nYou\u2019re nervous as all hell, but you compose yourself trying to keep focused on saving Zal. Once your get yourself in that state of mind, you leave.\n\nFrom past conversations with Zalmora, you remember the general location of Flame\u2019s hideout. Takes about a day, but eventually you find it thanks to Flame\u2019s people being fairly loud while wandering around the area.\n\nYou figure you\u2019ll speed this up by surrendering to Flame\u2019s men as they\u2019ll take you straight to her, so you call out to the ones you see and begin putting up your hands stating that Flameflower is expecting you. Three bandits come at you, with one pointing a crossbow at you.\n\nFirst thing they do is search you for weapons and take the bag of loot off of you. When one with a full beard looks inside, his eyes bug out.\n\n\u201cFucking nice.\u201d He says.\n\u201cNever seen anyone shit all stupid as you walking around with this small fortune without even a weapon. You must have goblin shit for brains.\u201d A younger looking bandit adds.\n\u201cAs I said, Flameflower is expecting me and that small fortune you\u2019re holding is hers.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSounds about right, that\u2019s way more than that bitch would ever share with us.\u201d The biggest one says.\n\u201cY\u2019know this is the first I\u2019m hearing of this. Who are you?\u201d the bearded one holding the loot asks.\n\nYou explain who you are and the situation, and while they vaguely know about Flameflower having ongoing dealings with people in Hessla, it seems like these three have only just been informed of her recent plan as apparently they haven\u2019t been back to the camp for awhile and been trying to find easy picking on the road with no success.\n\n\u201cWell, guess we better take this asshole back to Flame.\u201d The young bandit says.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d the bearded one asks.\n\u201cHe just said she\u2019s expecting him, that\u2019s why dipshit.\u201d The tall one says.\n\u201cYeah, I know that you lanky horse fucker, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not like she knows he\u2019s coming right this minute. There\u2019s nobody around. We could just kill this fucker and take this for ourselves. I mean shit, we\u2019ve just spent days out here and for what? Fucking foot rot and nearly getting our asses shot by all too well equipped caravans, because she didn\u2019t see fit to send more people with us.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. What if this gets back to Flame? She\u2019ll fucking have our balls for breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cWho says we need to even stick around? I mean there\u2019s enough here for the three of us to live okay for awhile. At least enough to not have to fumble around in this fucking wilderness for an existence.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know what, you\u2019re right. FUCK Flameflower. That bitch gave me fucking crotch rot on three separate occasions. I\u2019m surprised I even got a dick left. Let\u2019s take this shit and head to Hessla.\u201d The young one finally says in an outburst.\n\nThis has gone horribly wrong. You need to get out of here now. While the bandits are still talking about their plans you immediately turn to run.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d the youngest one says and immediately gives chase.\n\nAt one time you probably could have outran him, but again you\u2019ve been a little out of shape since your quieter time with Zalmora and he eventually tackles you to the ground.\n\nThe pair of you struggle for awhile, but despite being out of practice, you still prove to be stronger and manage to overpower the young bandit, killing him with his own dagger.\n\nAnd then you feel a bolt go into your back causing you to collapse on top of the bandit you just killed.\n\nYou struggle to crawl away, but the tall bandit who just shot you takes his time and manages to reload and finish you off with another bolt to your head.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Try to save Zalmora", "result": "You briefly think about emptying out the store\u2019s till and taking all that coin along with the Blue Dream to Flame, but is that really going to work? If Flame has already suddenly taken Zal hostage, chances are she\u2019ll just keep everything you bring and kill the pair of you.\n\nIt\u2019s an impossible situation and the more you dwell on it, the angrier you get. You\u2019re going there all right, but you\u2019re not going there to negotiate. You going there armed for combat.\n\nYou\u2019ve never been one to seek out a fight; indeed you\u2019ve usually always tried to avoid such things, be it from the law or other criminals.\n\nBut you have killed before, and you know you can do it again. And right now there has never been a better reason.\n\nYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to survive this, as you\u2019re not some hardened bandit like they are. Indeed, you\u2019ve probably gotten a little out of shape due to your less strenuous life. However, some skills you never unlearn. You\u2019re a rogue and you\u2019ll take them one by one silently if need be or die trying.\n\nWhile your intention is going to try to be silent as possible, one can never be too sure, so you grab various small firearms you have in the shop and check and recheck them. You then grab a small hand crossbow and several bolts.\n\nAs prepared as you\u2019re going to be, you head out.\n\nFrom past conversations with Zalmora, you remember the general location of Flame\u2019s hideout. Takes about a day, but eventually you find it thanks to Flame\u2019s people being fairly loud while wandering around the area.\n\nYou see two of them and mentally prepare yourself for the first casualties you\u2019re about to inflict in this task.\n\nYou sneak up and slit one of the bandit\u2019s throats. He makes just enough noise for him to alert his fellow, which you shoot in the chest with your crossbow. Fortunately you\u2019re close enough you can\u2019t really miss.\n\nTwo down, and who knows how many more to go. As Zal said, Flame\u2019s been getting organized so she\u2019s probably got more people than when you first met her. You picked a hell of a time to attack a bandit camp.\n\nYou kill three more, one nearly escaping to warn his fellows. He still made enough noise for someone to possibly hear so who knows how much time you actually have.\n\nThe funny thing is how easy this actually is, you thought you\u2019d have a harder time of it, but so far these bandits have been putting up a pitiful showing. Maybe these bandits are so used to attacking defenseless travellers that most of them don\u2019t really have much skill in actual combat.\n\nBy the time you get to the camp however, they know something is going on as you see a few running back and forth and shouting. You manage to kill one more in secret before several of them finally spot you.\n\nWith no more element of surprise, you shoot two more and severely wound another before Flameflower comes out from her tent and demands that her people capture you alive.\n\nYou try to backtrack so you aren\u2019t encircled, but it\u2019s too late, you\u2019ve been successfully outflanked.\n\nYou feel a bolt go into your leg and then another into your arm. You drop to the ground in pain.\n\nYou see one of Flame\u2019s people coming and you weakly throw a dagger at him before you feel a blow to the back of your head.\n\nAs you lose consciousness, you hear Flameflower\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cFucking hell, pretty boy got some fight in him! You know how I like me a badass, this is gonna be fun!\u201d\n\nEverything goes black.\n\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself stripped naked, standing stretched out with your arms and legs tied to two poles. Flameflower sits nearby throwing pebbles at your face. Two bigger bandits stand near the tent entrance.\n\n\u201cFinally up. Shit, been waiting for what feels like forever.\u201d Flame says.\n\u201cWhere the hell is Zal?\u201d you utter.\n\u201cI\u2019d be more concerned about yourself right now. Especially after what you pulled. Shit, you really made a mess of things pretty boy. What did you think you were going to do? Come in and kill all of us and save the girl like in one of those badly written fairy tales?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell that took a lot of balls I\u2019ll give you that. Shit, wish someone felt that way about me. I know none of these assholes would try to save me if I was being held hostage. Fucking romantic and shit y\u2019know? Zal always did know how to pick \u2018em I guess.\u201d\n\nFlameflower stands up and walks over to you. She begins caressing your upper body a bit and then moves her hand lower to just grope you.\n\n\u201cMmm yeah. Now, I know you are probably feeling a wide range of emotions right now. The chief one probably being hate and anger, which I understand, but that shit isn\u2019t gonna do you any good except get you killed slowly and painfully.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the fuck is Zal?!\u201d\n\u201cTHAT BITCH IS FUCKING DEAD! She was fucking dead before I even sent the note! I had my boys beat and rape her before they dumped her in the woods to let the fucking animals eat her dead violated ass. Thought about keeping her body around to taunt you with, but honestly, even I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of her. She was all nasty and gross looking. Cum and blood all over her fucking face, flies started crawling on her. I mean I nearly threw up myself y\u2019know?\u201d\n\nYou feel a southern \u201csqueeze\u201d on your tender bits, but that pain doesn\u2019t even match the pain you feel from hearing this news.\n\n\u201cYou gonna cry over that dead cunt? Let me tell you something about Zalmora. That fucking bitch was a damn rat traitor. I have no doubt in my mind that she\u2019s the reason that the Klyton militia found our old hideout. You know how I know? Because in her last moments she even offered to trade YOU to me in exchange for her miserable life. So much for true love.\u201d\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And you know this because you were here? You a fucking wizard or something? You don\u2019t know shit pretty boy. Nobody EVER really knows anybody. Especially when shit goes down. I mean you think Zal thought I was going to kill her? Of course she didn\u2019t. She thought in her arrogance that our profitable business arrangement was enough. That I was just some dumb ass that was easily appeased and granted, I was for a while. Shit, despite thinking she was a stuck up cunt, I didn\u2019t even really hate her, just was business.\u201d\n\u201cBusiness?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I decided on a better arrangement that didn\u2019t involve you two. But none of this shit matters now. What matters now is pleasure AND how much you want to live. Normally I\u2019d just kill you and this would be over with, but I want that dick. Tired of fucking these smelly ugly fuckers. Want some of what Zal had for a change. A nice face to look at as I\u2019m riding that cock. Now I\u2019m going to get that, whether YOU want to or not, but the more willing you are, the greater you improve your chances.\u201d\n\u201cBetter just kill me then because I doubt if I\u2019m going to be up for that.\u201d\n\u201cHah, you think I can\u2019t get you hard? Shit, I got several ways I could get you hard. I slide that dick down my velvet throat a few times and you\u2019d be harder than a rock golem. I could have one of my boys here fuck you in the ass a bit. Saw that happen to a couple guys a few times, doesn\u2019t always seem to work, but still fun to watch though. However, I got a better idea because I want you to last and I want to enjoy this for as long as possible. Lou, get that shit you use on your dick.\u201d\n\u201cUm, the wart ointment?\u201d Lou asks.\n\u201cNo, goblin shit for brains, I\u2019m talking about the stuff that gives you more stamina than the usual two pumps you do.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Okay boss.\u201d\n\u201cIn the meantime, I think I\u2019ll get a taste of things to come\u2026\u201d\n\nAs you stand tied helpless while Flameflower has a sword fight with you in her mouth, all you can think about is how the hell you\u2019re going to get out of this, along with how many diseases you dick is probably getting right now.\n\nWhen Lou returns with a small bottle Flame tell him and the other goon to force your mouth open and turn your head up as she pours the contents down your throat. Tastes horrible, whatever it is, but you soon feel the effects.\n\n\u201cWell now. Looks like you really like me after all! Lou, Haylon, untie pretty boy here and get some help holding him down outside, I want an audience for this!\u201d\n\nAfter punching you in the gut to take the wind out of you, Lou and Haylon cut your ropes and drag you outside where some of the bandits start whooping it up. After a couple more punches to you face several of the bandits hold your arms and legs.\n\n\u201cHey! Not the face boys! Like I said, I want him to have a clear look at these magnificent tits bouncing in front of him!\u201d Flameflower says as she exits her tent completely naked.\n\nFlameflower poses a bit to the cheers of her bandit buddies and then looks down at you as you remain helpless\n\n\u201cYeah, I know I\u2019m beautiful. Now brace yourself pretty boy, because you may feel a burning sensation\u2026\u201d\n\nFlameflower lowers herself on you and you\u2019re convinced you just shoved your dick in a vat of lava. Flameflower\u2019s name has taken on a whole new meaning. You might indeed be as hard as a rock golem, but you sure aren\u2019t enjoying this experience.\n\nYou still don\u2019t know if you\u2019re surviving this, but even if you do, your dick might not.\nThis whole situation is just horrible as Flameflower laughs and people cheer her on and you\u2019re utterly powerless to stop any of it.\n\nWhile it feels like forever, it\u2019s only been an hour and you finally release into her, though it feels more like a stream of fire.\n\n\u201cAww! I was just enjoying that and I\u2019m not done yet!\u201d\n\nFlameflower gets in close and whispers in your ear.\n\n\u201cI know what you can do.\u201d Flameflower says and licks your face before getting off of you.\n\n\u201cGet him on his knees lads, pretty boy here is gonna finish me off like a real gentleman. I want all of you uncouth louts to take notes!\u201d\n\nYou are forced up and then slammed down to your knees by Flame\u2019s biggest goons. At this point you feel like you want to die, but somewhere within you, you still feel that spark of survival.\n\nFlameflower stands in front of you and you\u2019re literally eye level to her nasty infested diseased hole. You nearly want to retch from the smell. Flameflower grabs a knife from one of her people, which she runs gently across the side of your cheek.\n\n\u201cNow, I want you to do mommy right. I want you to make me come hard and multiple times. You understand? Because if you don\u2019t, what you\u2019re experiencing now, can be ten times worse and much longer.\u201d\n\nFlameflower begins pushing your head closer to her snatch and you\u2019re still trying to figure out a way to survive this.\n\n\u201cWait, so if I do this\u2026will you let me live?\u201d you ask.\n\nFlameflower starts laughing and then looks at you while roughly grabbing the back of your head to look at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably still going to kill you. However, IF you show some enthusiasm, then MAYBE I\u2019ll keep you around as my lick bitch.\u201d\n\nFlameflower holds the knife close to your head as she uses her other hand to push your head into her. As your face gets so close that you can now see the crabs, you close your eyes, mentally praying to ALL the gods that you\u2019ll be able to do this without puking or passing out from the smell (and/or taste).\n\nYour tongue nervously starts to exit your mouth\u2026\n\nAnd suddenly an explosion deafens you and causes you to tip over and you aren\u2019t the only one. You look up in time to see the crowd around you disperse.\n\nAnother explosion occurs and this one is close enough that a few bandits get caught in it. Someone invested in some firebombs.\n\nMeanwhile Flameflower is standing around barking orders at everyone and then her attention turns back to you.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what asshole is attacking us, but YOU are not getting away. Lou, Haylon, get him!\u201d\n\nYou quickly start scrambling away only to have Lou grab your arm. Just as Haylon is about to back him up, a shot is heard and Haylon\u2019s head partially explodes like a ripe melon.\n\nMore shots are fired causing Flameflower to run for cover as bodies start dropping. You punch Lou in the face causing him to let go of you and then grab a dagger from one of his sheaths and stab him in the neck with it.\n\nYou look around and that\u2019s when you see who it is that\u2019s been attacking.\n\nAnnah limps slowly around the camp, welding some sort of fancy repeating pistol. You didn\u2019t even know she had one of those. She\u2019s not missing a shot either, even with only one good eye.\n\nOnce again this woman is just full of surprises.\n\n\u201cI got this, go get that naked bitch!\u201d Annah shouts.\n\nLast time you saw Flameflower, she ran back into her tent, probably to get a better weapon, however there are still some bandits that haven\u2019t given up the fight and while Annah\u2019s a good shot, she\u2019s still going to have to reload.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Annah", "result": "Ignoring Annah\u2019s commands, you immediately grab a crossbow off of one of the dead bodies nearby and a short sword.\n\nAnnah fires off one more round and then has to reload just like you figured she round. A couple of the bandits try to rush her, but you fire your own crossbow at them. You miss, but it\u2019s enough to cause one to desperately try to get out of the way and stop his advance.\n\nThe other bandit trying to attack Annah you cross swords with. You do okay, but you\u2019re still hurting from getting hit with a bolt in your arm and leg earlier (along with everything else) not to mention you\u2019re without any protection.\n\nEventually the other bandit you shot at, regains his composure and moves in to attack you, however at this point Annah has already reloaded and before either bandit can gain the advantage on you, she\u2019s shot both of them.\n\nYou turn around just in time to see Flameflower come out of her tent with two pistols and you immediately shove Annah out of the way and try to duck in the process, but then you feel another burning sensation. This one however is on the left side of your head followed by the ringing pain of where an ear once was and a bloody hole now all that remains.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d you shout and fall to the ground holding the left side of your head.\n\nYou fully expect another shot to either kill you or Annah as you\u2019re both prone and Flame was holding two pistols.\n\n\u201cCHECKERS KILL!\u201d you hear Annah shout despite the ringing.\n\nThis is followed by the sounds of growling, shouting and then several shots being fired from nearby.\n\nBy the time you get up, you see Checkers happily trotting over to Annah who stands nearby and looking over at Flameflower\u2019s body.\n\nAnnah limps over towards Flameflower and just as you\u2019re about to tell her to be careful, she fires again at Flame\u2019s hand, which apparently was going for the pistol she dropped after being attacked by Checkers.\n\n\u201cArgh! Shit! Fuck!\u201d Flame manages to gurgle as she loses a couple fingers.\n\nYou and Annah now both approach Flame who is a bloody mess at this point. Still, she\u2019s managing to hang on to continue to look defiantly at you.\n\n\u201c(Cough) Fuck\u2026who\u2019s this bitch with the great aim? Nother girlfriend?\u201d Flame asks.\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201c(Gurgle) well ain\u2019t you a (cough) fuckin lady killer, pretty boy\u2026\u201d\n\nYou pick up the pistol that Flame was trying to grab. You then kneel down and ram the pistol in her mouth, breaking out some of her teeth in the process.\n\n\u201cHold on baby, I\u2019m gonna shoot my load, get that velvet throat of yours ready\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cMmugh guh ack\u2026\u201d Flame chokes and weakly tries to struggle against you.\n\nYou pull the trigger and blow most of her head apart. Blood splatters everywhere, along with brains and skull.\n\n\u201cWas it good for you?\u201d\n\nAs you slowly stand up, you feel a bit numb. Annah touches your shoulder, but you ignore it. You just feel like you\u2019re in another place. You aren\u2019t even aware if all the bandits are dead, you just walk into Flame\u2019s tent and when inside, you sit down and just think about everything that transpired.\n\nMeanwhile Annah looks around to see if there are any more enemies and fortunately it looks like you both killed them all. The pair of you ironically just made the roads a lot safer from thievery and murder.\n\nBy the time Annah comes back to check on you, you\u2019ve managed to gather yourself enough that you\u2019ve got your clothes back on. You\u2019re still sort of sitting and staring into nothing though.\n\n\u201cYou um\u2026all\u2026nevermind that\u2019s a stupid question. Of course you\u2019re not alright.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not. But I will be eventually. I just\u2026got a lot on my mind right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I couldn\u2019t get here sooner. Fucking bum leg\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Annah. Better that you came late, rather than not at all. I\u2019m guessing you were spying on me again?\u201d\n\u201cWell, after our exchange in your shop a few days ago, I was still in Hessla pondering whether or not to try to win you back or at least give you back your savings and take the Blue Dream off your hands so you didn\u2019t have the hassle. When I saw you leave the shop and then heading towards out of town looking like you had a grim purpose, I knew something must be wrong, so I followed. Hell of a time keeping up. Thankfully Checkers is an excellent tracker. Again, my apologies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd again, it\u2019s a good thing you did. Fuck\u2026\u201d\n\nYou begin to feel the weight of what happened to you and you put your head in your hands desperately trying not to cry, but you can\u2019t help it.\n\nSeeing that you\u2019re distressed, Annah goes over to try to comfort you, but you stop her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Annah. Just don\u2019t. I\u2019m probably fucking crawling with disease and you don\u2019t need to be around that. Not to mention that my mind is in a very dark place right now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I understand and I get it. I just want you to know though; I went through something similar so I\u2019m here, okay? I\u2019m going to leave you alone and I\u2019ll just be outside looking around again. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nYou nod and Annah leaves.\n\nWhile what Flameflower did to you was certainly traumatic enough, what you\u2019re really upset about is Zalmora. She\u2019s dead, and you don\u2019t even know where the body is, not that you\u2019d probably want to see it after what Flameflower described.\n\nThough the worst of it is, was Flameflower telling the truth or just fucking with your head?\n\nNot about what they did before killing her, though that\u2019s terrible enough, but did Zal really offer to trade you to Flameflower in a desperate attempt to survive?\n\nYou have a hard time believing that and yet Flame was right about one thing, nobody ever truly knows anybody. Who knows what the hell happened. Maybe the agony was just so great for Zal that she did something so desperate and unthinkable to survive. You nearly did and would have if Annah hadn\u2019t showed up when she did.\n\nIn the end, does it really matter if she did? She\u2019s dead and you\u2019ll never really know the truth. You\u2019re fairly certain that it was bullshit, but even it wasn\u2019t\u2026well you guess you can live with the idea that you understand. You never experienced any betrayal by Zalmora, so you\u2019ll remember her as your relationship was with her. A pleasant one with many happy memories.\n\nBecause that\u2019s all you got of her now.\n\nYou slowly gather the rest of your belongings and briefly go through Flameflower\u2019s tent. You\u2019re not really in the mood to loot, but it\u2019s a habit and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to come back here ever again.\n\nYou don\u2019t find much of actual value except a bit of coin, however what you find more interesting is a few more notes laying on a table. Out of curiosity you read some of them and put one in your pocket before exiting the tent.\n\nOutside, you find Annah sitting on the ground with an overstuffed bag and petting Checkers. They both look in your direction and Checkers even trots over to you as if to greet you. Hard to believe the little furball is friendly with you, though she probably has contributed to saving your life on more than one occasion.\n\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You answer giving Checkers a quick pet.\n\u201cOkay, my apologies if the trip to Hessla takes awhile due to my leg.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, but I was going to Klyton.\u201d\n\u201cKlyton? Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I got a fire down below, I\u2019d like something that\u2019s sure to cure it and Klyton has better medical facilities. I\u2019m not worried about the store right now.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Yeah I get it. Well I understand if you need to go on ahead. I can meet you in Klyton if you want.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be good company Annah. Not for a long while. I got a shitload of baggage I need to work out and go through. Last thing I want to do is drive you away because I\u2019m in a dark mood.\u201d\n\"Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You know why? Because despite every shitty thing that\u2019s happened, I have learned one thing, we always find each other somehow. Maybe we\u2019ll part ways now, but I know we\u2019re going to see each other again. I dunno, maybe that\u2019s how our relationship works best. You have saved my life multiple times now. I doubt if I\u2019m ever going to be able to repay that debt no matter how much you take from my savings. I look at you and I really wish I\u2019d been there to help you with the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You would have just gotten us both killed.\u201d\n\nAnnah starts to smile and then you chuckle a bit.\n\n\u201cProbably right.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo this is goodbye again.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cJust for a little while. Maybe next time\u2026maybe next time we\u2019ll get it right.\u201d\n\nAnnah goes to hug you, and despite you reminding her of your carrying of three hundred sexual diseases, she hugs you anyway. She then says she\u2019s going to head back to Hessla since it\u2019s closer and less of a strain on her legs. She then says she\u2019ll probably book passage on a ship to Holgard, since she hasn\u2019t been there yet.\n\nThe two of you then part ways.\n\nYou make your way to Klyton trying hard to ignore your pain. You really hope you can get something before your dick falls off.\n\nWhen you finally get to Klyton, you nonchalantly nod at the guards and ask where the closest and cheapest medical facilities in the city as you just got robbed and barely escaped with your life.\n\nGiven how you look and the serious tone of your voice, the guard has no reason to disbelieve your story and tells you how to get to the nearest apothecary and says they really need to do more to start keeping the nearby roads safe from bandits.\n\nYou enter Klyton and from there you immediately know where to go.\n\nYou head to Klyton hospital and while you might not have done this in awhile, you never really forget. Fortunately the medicine for curing dick rot is a lot easier to acquire than Numb and the rest of the shit you used to sell, so security isn\u2019t as strong.\n\nYou grab a couple bottles of the strongest stuff you can find and make haste out of the hospital. You down one bottle of the medicine which tastes terrible, but hopefully it works.\n\nIn the meantime you pay for a cheap inn and try to get some rest, which you fail at since you have nightmares the whole time.\n\nA couple days pass and your dick starts to feel better, though still not a hundred percent. The rest of your body still aches as well, but your mind is still dealing with the shit that happened. You weep over Zal a bit despite already having come to grips with it. Your mind always goes back to anger and hate though. You half wish Flameflower was alive so you could kill her slower this time.\n\nYou \u201csupport\u201d your stay at the cheap inn, the old way. Klyton may have tightened their security, but people remain oblivious idiots that don\u2019t watch their coin purses. If anything, they seem to be less observant. Must be due to feeling safer.\n\nAfter about two weeks, your body is more or less healed and your dick is no longer burning like a blacksmith\u2019s furnace. Your mind still isn\u2019t quite right, but then was it ever?\n\nStill, you\u2019re in a better frame of mind of what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nYou catch a carriage and head back to Hessla. When you arrive and get back to the shop, you\u2019re actually surprised it hasn\u2019t been looted or burned down or something. Then again hasn\u2019t been the end of the month for the Governor to take a cut yet.\n\nYou look around and see everything still in place. When you go to your safe though, you get a bit of a surprise. You find all your savings inside. The Blue Dream bag is gone. You guess Annah broke in the store (along with cracking the safe! Another thing she must have learned) and returned everything.\n\nYou just hope Annah doesn\u2019t get into any trouble trying to sell that Blue Dream, but then again if she does, she\u2019ll probably get out of it.\n\nYou look around the shop remembering the good times you had here with Zal, then load your savings into your pack and take the silver whistle Zalmora first gave you and leave the shop for good.\n\nYou book passage on a ship, which is leaving for Jicol. You\u2019ve always heard about opportunities there and you\u2019ve never been there before. Might as well try some place new.\n\nBefore you leave however you make one more visit.\n\nYou enter Little Lorenzo\u2019s shop. Lorenzo\u2019s shop as usual is empty. Even without you as direct competition, he\u2019s not doing any better.\n\nThe halfling\u2019s eyes widen when he sees you. Obviously he thought you weren\u2019t coming back. You draw your pistol.\n\n\u201cWait! We can\u2026\u201d\n\nYou fire and hit the Halfling in the head. His body slumps over with unspectacular thud.\n\n\u201cNext time, don\u2019t put shit in writing.\u201d\n\nYou throw the crumpled correspondence between Lorenzo and Flameflower near his body before walking back out.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Chapter 3E: Reunited\n\n\n\nYear 30\n\nNone of your dealings with gangs has ever been positive which is why its odd that you inadvertently became looked up to one.\n\nGranted it\u2019s made up of a bunch of snot nosed teenagers, but they\u2019ve been trying to emulate you for years since they were snot nosed kids.\n\nThe Black Hooks have been unofficially looking to you for guidance ever since you easily caught a couple of them trying to pick your pocket a couple years ago and scolded them for their sloppy technique. Some of them seem to have potential, others just seem like they\u2019re just in it to cause trouble and be rebellious. Their \u201cleader\u201d Marco talks a big game and even seems to resent the fact that so many in his gang speak positively of you, but in the scheme of things, he seems like he wants to be like you on some level.\n\nStill, as teenagers are want to do, they don\u2019t always listen very well. You certainly didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMarco, I know you and your little friends are really proud about your recent string of break ins, but you lot still have a lot to learn about stealth. I\u2019ve told you the story about the Bloody Talons haven\u2019t I?\u201d you remark.\n\u201cYes! A million times!\u201d Marco says exasperatedly.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll hear it a million more until you fuckers get it right or you\u2019re going to end up just like the Bloody Talons! More importantly, you\u2019re making shit unnecessarily more difficult for the rest of us trying to make a living out here. The more reckless you are, the more the Jicol Watch starts actually cracking down on everyone. We don\u2019t need that shit. We got it good here thanks to Jicol tending to worry more about pirates than us land based criminals.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019d rather be a pirate.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, no you wouldn\u2019t. You like the IDEA of being a pirate because you hear all about their glorious tales of raping and pillaging whenever they dock here. Trust me, I\u2019ve dealt with enough pirates for them to tell me some of their stories to know that that life isn\u2019t all that glamorous. Most of the time it\u2019s a lot of waiting around on a ship fighting off scurvy and other crew members trying to do harm to your fucking asshole by shoving a dick it in. You want to get fucked in the ass?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sound so sure about that. Because if that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m pretty sure there are a lot of pirate captains that would like a cabin boy like you.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Fuck no.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then. In any case, stop immediately breaking windows when you\u2019re struggling with a lock. Locks are like women and sometimes you gotta take a little time with them before they open up and give you the goods. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but most of the time it\u2019s worth it and you\u2019ll feel a better sense of accomplishment. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you trying to sell this time?\u201d\n\nAfter doing a little bartering and taking advantage of Marco\u2019s lack of knowledge of the value of his stolen goods, you bid him and his buddies goodbye and remind him to remember what you said.\n\nAs you make your way back to your humble home, halfway there you get the sense that you\u2019re being followed and watched. It isn\u2019t he Black Hook either.\n\n\u201cAlright, you lot might as well come out, unless you intend on shooting me from the shadows that you\u2019re hiding in.\u201d\n\nA single older man steps out from said shadows.\n\n\u201cNope, just me.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh I go by the same name I have for years now. Sneaks. Though apparently not sneaky enough seeing as you sensed me. Such is the failing of once superior skills with getting old.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting too much older if you keeping following me around, now what do you want?\u201d\n\u201cNo need for hostility friend, though I suppose it would have been better to just approach you directly. Honestly, I\u2019ve known about you for a year or so now, but seeing as I do my own fencing like most others like myself around here, never really needed to speak with you before.\u201d\n\u201cOh? So do you have something then?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s more of a concern that\u2026well let\u2019s just say the underworld community has.\u201d\n\u201cUnderworld community? First I\u2019m hearing of an organized gang here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there isn\u2019t one and we\u2019re all hoping it stays that way. Nothing good comes from monolithic organizations. I should know I had to directly fight the Ebony Claw Syndicate back in Holgard and ultimately lost.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll get no argument from me. I\u2019ve never been part of a gang and never had any positive experiences with them.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Then one wonders why you\u2019re actively encouraging and acting as a mentor of sorts to one.\u201d\n\nYou nearly chuckle at what Sneaks is getting at.\n\n\u201cThe Black Hooks? I mean yeah I guess they\u2019re a gang, but they\u2019re hardly the Ebony Claw Syndicate. They\u2019re mostly a bunch of dumb teenagers.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure the Syndicate started as a bunch of dumb teenagers too, until someone molded and lead them to be a powerful organization.\u201d Sneaks replies.\n\u201cI am NOT the leader of the Black Hooks nor do I have any desire to be. That dubious honor belongs to their mildly more intelligent member, Marco. I can\u2019t help it if some of them look to me for tips and shit. If anything, my guidance as you call it, is making things better for the rest of us. I just told them to knock it off with their smash and grab routines and other shit that brings the heat down on everyone.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can see that would be a good thing, however I don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking at the greater picture. You are correct in that they\u2019re mostly dumb teenagers and their actions draw more attention. However, I also imagine that they wouldn\u2019t last very long. Sooner, rather than later, the Jicol Watch would wipe out most of them and things would be harder for the rest of us for awhile, but eventually the status quo would return since Jicol has always been more concerned with a potential pirate attack rather than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cYour point?\u201d\n\u201cMy point is, YOU are teaching them to be better criminals. Basically, more of them are going to survive and even thrive because of you. Not only does this mean more competition for all of us, it also means the Black Hooks are likely to survive as a gang. This organization is going to eventually realize that they outnumber the independent competition and take steps to eliminate said competition, or force them to join. Since some of us aren\u2019t likely to go quietly, some of the independents are going to form their OWN gang for protection and before you know it, there\u2019s a war going on. As I said, I\u2019ve read that tale before and it didn\u2019t end well.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me who I can or can\u2019t associate with?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying to not continue to do whatever business you have with them. I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing something like that. Anyway I said my piece. Do what you want obviously. I\u2019m just suggesting that helping them as much as you have been, might not be in any of our best interests in the long run.\u201d\n\u201cDuly noted.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Sneaks nods and takes his leave. You have to admit, he does have somewhat of a point, but on the other hand some of it sounded like a threat with that last bit.\n\nYou continue on your way home and then you see a figure near it. The figure isn\u2019t even hiding. They\u2019re just casually sitting on your front step. Seems you\u2019re popular today.\n\nAs you approach a little cautiously, the notice the figure is female and a little furry animal pop out from around her then\u2026\n\n\u201cAnnah?\u201d you call out.\n\u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d get home. I would have let myself in, but who knows what traps you\u2019ve rigged and I\u2019m not quite as nimble anymore. Besides, wouldn\u2019t be polite right?\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019ve at last respected my boundaries. Not just for me, but for yourself. That door doesn\u2019t even lead inside, come on, I\u2019ll take you the real way.\u201d\n\u201cOh, a secret way in. Nice, but aren\u2019t you concerned about me knowing?\u201d\n\u201cNot at this point. Besides, I don\u2019t keep anything of actual value in here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter leading Annah in the real way to your home (with Checkers slowly following behind), she asks you how you\u2019ve been and what you\u2019ve been up to. You give a brief answer that you\u2019ve been doing better since the last time you saw her (physically and mentally) and how it\u2019s mostly been back to the standard burglary for you along with some fencing for the Black Hooks.\n\n\u201cBlack Hooks huh? They Jicol\u2019s version of the Talons?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cThey wish. It\u2019s mostly a bunch of teenagers being wild. Though I\u2019ve been mildly trying to direct them away from what led to the Talons\u2019 demise in Klyton.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather altruistic of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like covering my own ass in the long run so Jicol doesn\u2019t turn into another Klyton. However, someone recently told me that I should just let these kids twist in the wind and get themselves killed by the law since it gets rid of a potential greater threat in the future, like the Black Hooks actually becoming competent and powerful united force.\u201d\n\u201cI can see a logic in both approaches actually. So what were you planning to do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. I\u2019m going to continue to go about my life and if anyone gets in my face about what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ll deal with it then.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you. Sooo\u2026the Black Hooks the only gang in the city?\u201d\n\u201cIf you can call them that. Yeah. Everyone else is more or less independent though I\u2019m sure a few work together at times. Nobody really has any turf though as far as places being off limits to others. Not even the Black Hooks are like that, though they do have a location where they all hang out that they probably consider their own.\u201d\n\u201cWould you say there is a strong disregard for authority here in the underworld community?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there always?\u201d\n\u201cWell yes, but I meant it sounds like other than the Black Hooks, nobody is really organized and probably would resist against such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, this is an odd line of questioning you\u2019re going for\u2026out with it.\u201d\n\nAnnah looks down a bit, before looking at you again. You have to say, you still aren\u2019t used to that eye patch she has.\n\n\u201cPromise you won\u2019t get mad?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cWell that doesn\u2019t sound good. (Sigh) Fine. I promise I\u2019ll TRY not to get mad.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOkay. Well, since we last saw each other, I\u2019ve been in Holgard and I\u2019ve sort of had dealings with the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cOh for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m actually on good terms with them now. Well at least the chapter in Holgard. Apparently the head there Rook. Isn\u2019t too pleased with some of the leadership decisions in the Delantium Kingdom and he\u2019s been making a few moves of his own. To cut a long story short, I\u2019ve been working with the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cYou joined the fucking Syndicate?!\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m more like a hired gun. Literally, most of the time. I\u2026uh\u2026accept a lot of contracts on people.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Wow. Okay then. Still, I would have thought the Syndicate would have had people like that on their payroll.\u201d\n\u201cEh, that\u2019s sort of the problem with the Holgard chapter. It doesn\u2019t get much support from the top. It\u2019s almost seen as more of a money-making outpost. Enough to keep a presence in, but not important enough to put extra manpower into. This might not be a problem if Holgard didn\u2019t suffer shit like civil rebellions and religious faction fights every five years or so. As a result the Syndicate chapter in Holgard has had to make more use of independents than they would like. Though they tend to REALLY want you to join. I\u2019ve gotten the sales pitch several times. Fortunately I\u2019m good enough at what I do that I\u2019ve been able to decline and still remain unaligned.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like a dangerous game you\u2019re playing Annah. I mean this is the same organization that\u2026well did THAT to you.\u201d\n\u201cSame organization, but different people and different circumstances. Besides, I\u2019m not trying to rip them off this time. I\u2019m legitimately doing work for them, which is why I\u2019m here actually.\u201d\n\nAnnah goes into an explanation that the head of the Syndicate chapter in Holgard, Rook is looking to expand his own power base here on Jicol. Since Annah has done such good work for him in the past he\u2019s sent her here to scout the place rather than sending his own people.\n\nShe says that her main job is to make a note of all the major players in the city. She says that when she learned you were living here, she figured she could save some of the legwork by directly speaking to you about it.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026what then? Is the Syndicate just going to take this entire city over?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the plan, unless it turns out to be too much trouble, but based on even what little you\u2019ve told me and what little I\u2019ve seen, this place seems pretty ripe for a Syndicate takeover. Or at least Rook\u2019s takeover.\u201d Annah says briefly petting Checkers who is asleep by her feet.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to stop this?\u201d\n\u201cWell no, not really. The Syndicate is really looking to branch out here. Nothing that can be done about that unless you\u2019re going to try to unite everyone against them, but it would be pretty stupid to try that. The Syndicate pretty much always gets what they want. I should know.\u201d\n\u201cIt still surprises me that you\u2019d be working for them, given what happened. You never did tell me exactly.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I get what you mean. But shit happened and I wound up in bed with the Syndicate again. Fortunately it\u2019s been in my favor this time. It\u2019s sort of an amusing tale, maybe I\u2019ll tell you about it when I\u2019m not currently so busy.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cStill never told me about how you managed to get a room in the Klyton university dorms either.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Well I\u2019ll tell you that story too. I want to tell you everything. I mean\u2026shit\u2026I still miss you, y\u2019know? When I found out you lived here I was looking forward to seeing you again. Last time we parted company you said we\u2019d meet again as we seem to be destined to always do.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I remember. Just thought it might be under less complicated circumstances this time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how our relationship goes.\u201d\n\u201cObviously not.\u201d\n\nAnnah takes a deep breath and continues.\n\n\u201cThe Syndicate is coming, but it probably won\u2019t be immediately. In the meantime, I can speak positively about you when I get back to Holgard and you could probably become an associate much like I am. I could even relocate here while we prepare this place and we could work on tasks together like in the old days. Lots of coin to be made and we both know how much you like that.\u201d Annah says.\n\nWhile you wouldn\u2019t mind such a thing under normal circumstances, you really aren\u2019t keen on Annah\u2019s Syndicate involvement.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fully help Annah", "result": "Annah\u2019s ultimately always done what she\u2019s wanted to do so trying to talk her out of this is probably pointless. However, you know you want Annah back in your life since you\u2019ve missed her, so you\u2019ll help her completely in her task. That\u2019s from the emotional standpoint.\n\nFrom a pragmatic standpoint, it sounds like the Syndicate is coming whether Annah works for them or not. As dangerous as it might be to get involved with the Syndicate, you do see the benefit potential and with Annah around at least you won\u2019t necessarily have to change your life around too much or possibly relocate again.\n\nYou give Annah a rundown on every underworld contact you have of relative importance, along with the strength and numbers of the Black Hooks. You then also give Annah an approximate guess on the strength of the Jicol Watch and how effective they are.\n\n\u201cWould you say they\u2019re susceptible to working with the Syndicate? The Holgard Watch has never been too much of a problem in that regard.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cWell, the Jicol Watch isn\u2019t adverse to a bribe here and there, but the Mayor of Jicol tends to pay them well enough for them to not to make a habit of it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMayor of Jicol? Anything like the Governor of Hessla?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s ten times more reclusive. Apparently most haven\u2019t seen him in decades. About the only descriptions that exist are that the Mayor is male and human, but who knows? In any case, while this place is no stranger to corruption, it still adheres to law and order fairly strongly. Not Klyton level, but that\u2019s probably due to more emphasis on their fleet rather than land force which is thankfully smaller.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. So\u2026you going to go assassinate them all now?\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Well, based on everything you\u2019ve told me, doesn\u2019t seem like I need to bother. I suppose I could anyway. You said you spoke to someone called Sneaks that used to belong to the Thieves Guild in Holgard recently? I bet Rook would want to someone like that taken care of. Maybe the leader of the Black Hooks as well just to keep that group from getting too organized.\u201d\n\nYou think for a moment.\n\n\u201cWell, how about something to make your job a lot easier. I\u2019ll invite most of the more well known rogues to a gathering and get them all in one location. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to affect everyone and that it\u2019s really important. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard, Sneaks already came to me saying a lot of the independents are bitching about the Black Hooks so they\u2019ll probably be willing to speak especially if I\u2019m seemingly alone.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell that would simplify things. Um, don\u2019t you do business with most of them? Isn\u2019t this going to affect that?\u201d\n\u201cProbably for the better since they\u2019re more competition than anything else. I don\u2019t give a shit about any of them. Especially if they\u2019re already complaining about how I interact with the Black Hooks. Speaking of which let\u2019s leave Marco and the rest out of this. The Black Hooks can ultimately be incorporated into the Syndicate, I can help in that regard.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well if you say you can do it, then that sounds fine to me. You know them better than I do. It certainly would go a long way to have a force here that\u2019s already asset to the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I guess I\u2019ll start setting all this up tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. So um, you don\u2019t mind me staying here while we take care of all this do you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. I only got the one bed though.\u201d\n\u201cWell good, you know how I always like you to cuddle with me after sex anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I was going to build up a bit more to it, but glad to see you\u2019re on board with that.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, its probably the main reason I came to speak with you in the first place. Well that and to see if we still had a chance together. I know these circumstances aren\u2019t the most ideal, but when have things ever been normal for us? There\u2019s so much time that we\u2019ve missed together. I just really want to make it work this time.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\nAnnah immediately goes to kiss you.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s get started.\u201d She says and continues to kiss you while trying to strip off her clothing.\n\nYou proceed to rekindle the old flames.\n\nNext day\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, wake up. I know I\u2019d love for you to sleep next to me naked all day, but sadly we\u2019ve got some business to take care of.\u201d Annah says while nudging you awake, meanwhile you feel something wet on your hand, which is hanging over the side of the bed causing you to pull it away.\n\u201cAh! Something\u2026oh it\u2019s Checkers. She was licking my hand.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShe likes you, though it\u2019s probably hard for you to believe.\u201d\n\u201cWell the furry beast has assisted in saving my life a few times, so not that hard I suppose. Okay, well I\u2019m up. Guess I\u2019ll get started on that thing. Thinking I\u2019ll hold the meeting just outside Jicol. There\u2019s a small clearing that\u2019s been used sometimes for such things.\u201d\n\nYou proceed to get dressed and then give Annah a kiss before you leave.\n\nYou seek out every rogue you know that could potentially be trouble in the future and explain that Sneaks recently spoke to you and after sleeping on it a bit you decided that everyone is right and the Black Hooks have to go, but you can\u2019t do it alone and you want to have a meeting to coordinate an attack.\n\nSurprisingly everyone you speak to is receptive to this idea and agrees to come to this meeting. Granted you have a fairly \u201chonest\u201d reputation and nobody really likes the Black Hooks, but you thought you were going to have a few suspicious folks hesitate. Even Sneaks is glad to hear you listened to him.\n\n\u201cSomehow I knew you were a man of reason.\u201d Sneaks says.\n\u201cYeah, well apologies for being stand offish yesterday, I just\u2026well I have an aversion to advice sometimes.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cHm, well it\u2019s a common trait in our line of work. Think nothing of it. Still, do you think we need to completely wipe out the Black Hooks?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, I mean isn\u2019t this what you wanted yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cI said I would like to see them gone, though not necessarily killed. I mean I thought about some of the stuff you said as well yesterday and you were right that they\u2019re just a bunch of dumb teenagers in the scheme of things. No way to just scare them or even perhaps just kill the leader?\u201d\n\u201cNo half measures on this I\u2019m afraid. The Black Hooks have enough confidence now that it isn\u2019t completely tied up in just Marco. Besides, you know how gangs work. You kill the leader, and another one just pops up and could even be worse. No, as ruthless as this may be, it\u2019s going to be necessary.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. Oh well. Better them than us in the future. Okay, I\u2019ll be there at the meeting tonight. The quicker we get this grim business over with, the better.\u201d\n\nHaving done your part, you return home where you find Annah looking around.\n\n\u201cOh there you are, you talk to everyone you needed to?\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cYeah, can\u2019t believe I convinced everyone.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell you can be charming without trying sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWeird, always thought my sister was the one who had that trait.\u201d\n\u201cOh she did, however it probably seemed like she was better at it since she naturally has a more outgoing personality. Plus she had the advantage that most, if not all your marks tended to be old horny guys that liked pretty young girls.\u201d\n\u201cHm, guess I never thought about it that way before. Anyway, are you prepared? There\u2019s probably more of them coming than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cCounting Sneaks. Nine total.\u201d\n\u201cShit, I\u2019ll probably kill six of them before they realize what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ll be assisting right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we got this then. Well we got a lot of time to spare, let\u2019s go spend it in bed again.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you say I\u2019m the charming one.\u201d\n\nAfter another round of intimacy, Annah asks you for directions to this clearing so she can get there ahead of time before anyone else. You give her the directions and then you also tell to be careful since its not like the jungles are exactly free of unfriendly wildlife.\n\nYou then prepare your own firearms. You might not have the fancy ones Annah has or have her skill, but you\u2019re bringing enough pistols to hopefully kill someone before they can kill you or escape.\n\nYou then make your way to the clearing. When you get there, you find that everyone is there already. Several of them are clearly armed with firearms of their own, with muskets and blunderbusses being openly held. Apparently there was some caution.\n\n\u201cSee? Told you he was going to come alone.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why you came here an hour in advance just to make sure there weren\u2019t any Black Hooks hiding out to ambush us.\u201d Another adds.\n\u201cHm, I see trust is in short supply around here.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be that surprised. Hell you\u2019re betraying your Black Hook buddies. I mean what are the rest of us supposed to think?\u201d a third remarks with a chuckle.\n\u201cOkay gentlemen, I think all of our minds are a bit more at ease now. I apologize to our friend who organized this meeting, but I think under the circumstances, he should understand our caution.\u201d Sneaks remarks.\n\u201cOf course I do, I mean I certainly didn\u2019t come without weapons. For all I knew you lot were going to murder me out here.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cStill could.\u201d One rogue says, stepping forward a bit.\n\u201cTrue. But now I know which one to aim for first before I go.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHah, he\u2019s gotcha there.\u201d Another laughs.\n\u201cBut anyway, I didn\u2019t call you all here for a pissing contest. I called you all here because there\u2019s an important matter that needs taking care of and contrary to popular belief I\u2019m not buddies with the Black Hooks.\u201d\n\u201cSo you said to me earlier today, so what\u2019s this plan of yours to wipe them out and how can we help?\u201d Sneaks ask.\n\nYou walk around a bit to get into a better location that you\u2019ll be able to take cover quickly before answering. You aren\u2019t sure where Annah is, but if you know her as well as you know you do, she\u2019s not far away and probably already in position.\n\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t let me finish Sneaks. I\u2019m not betraying the Black Hooks either and you all can help me by not putting up a fight.\u201d You say and draw one of your pistols.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Sneaks shouts and tries to get out of the clearing.\n\nBefore anyone can get off a shot, Annah has opened fire and killed six of them. just like she said she would. You get one that tries to run at you with a dagger. The one with the blunderbuss fires wildly into the direction where he thinks the other shots are coming from and then you shoot him in the back.\n\nYou look around and find that Sneaks is gone. You assume he\u2019s heading back to the city though you\u2019re just guessing though since it\u2019s fairly dark. You\u2019re also concerned about Annah, since that one with the blunderbuss did fire into the jungle and it\u2019s possible he hit her.\n\n\u201cAnnah! Annah! Where are you? Are you alright?\u201d you shout, then you hear a gunshot in the near distance, followed by a yelp.\n\nYou run towards the noise and find Sneaks lying in the grass clutching his chest, that has a bloody hole in it. Annah stands nearby calmly reloading her pistol.\n\n\u201cThere you are. See, told you no problem. Wish this old asshole hadn\u2019t ran though, hate having to run nowadays. Well it\u2019s more of a quick limp, but I can get around fast if I really need to.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cThank the gods, you\u2019re alive.\u201d You say.\n\nMeanwhile Sneaks utters a few curses at you in between his dying breaths.\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t argue with all that Sneaks, but think of it this way. At least it wasn\u2019t the Black Hooks or even some insignificant dick that killed you. The Syndicate finally caught up with you.\u201d You say which then causes a brief look of surprise in Sneaks\u2019 eyes before you use your last flintlock to shoot him in the head.\n\n\u201cSo that was that Sneaks guy you told me about huh? Guess I\u2019ll mention to Rook that a long escaped enemy has been dealt with though I\u2019m sure the Syndicate has so many enemies on their shit list, this one won\u2019t matter too much. Still, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be looked upon as favorably.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I return to Holgard with all the information you provided along with what we did tonight. Then I\u2019ll try to get back here as soon as possible and we can take it from there.\u201d\n\u201cAre you so sure Rook will send you back here?\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure he\u2019ll want me here to assist in getting the Syndicate set up here. In any case I\u2019m still an independent assassin, not official Ebony Claw Syndicate so if he\u2019s got ideas to have me do something else, I don\u2019t have any obligation to do it and I\u2019ll be coming back here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I guess you know this guy better than I do. Just be careful. I still don\u2019t really like this situation with the Syndicate, but you can count on my support whatever you decide to do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m returning no matter what.\u201d\n\nAnnah kisses you and the pair of you return to Jicol and then home. Annah wants to get back to you as soon as possible so she leaves for Holgard on a ship the next day. She says she\u2019d like to leave Checkers with you since she\u2019s getting old and doesn\u2019t really like to travel as much anymore. You agree, though partially because at least the beast is sort of still like having part of Annah around.\n\nThe whole time, you can\u2019t help but think back to Zalmora and how she left you believing she\u2019d be back after accomplishing her task. And you\u2019ve got even longer to worry about something happening this time.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing for it however, except get back to work, which you begin to immerse yourself in. You start off by playing a more active role in the Black Hooks \u201cguidance.\u201d\n\nYou explain to Marco that things are going to start changing around Jicol eventually and they\u2019ll need to be better than they are now. Granted you\u2019re always telling them that, but you really emphasize the point. You suggest that they start getting into the protection racket. You also expand your own endeavors to lending coin and using the Black Hooks as the occasional enforcers for those that don\u2019t pay up.\n\nFunny that Sneaks and the rest were worried about what the Black Hooks were going to become and your possible role in it and it turned out they were right all along.\n\nHowever the concerns of the dead don\u2019t matter now, and with nobody really in the way to stop you from organizing a moldable bunch of teenagers, you effectively become Jicol\u2019s new crime boss. Other independents either stay out of your way, seek to curry favor or just leave.\n\nMonths pass and as they do, your concern for Annah grows and you start to get a little more ruthless in your actions. You know you\u2019re partially preparing the Black Hooks to be incorporated by the Syndicate as part of Annah\u2019s plan, but if she doesn\u2019t return, you swear you\u2019re going to take the lot of them with you on a ship to Holgard to extract vengeance on the Syndicate.\n\nThen one day you get a knock on your door. Checkers, who has normally been on the quiet side since Annah left you with her, starts getting very excited. You answer the door cautiously and\u2026\n\n\u201cSurprise! You miss me?\u201d Annah says.\n\nNormally you\u2019d be overjoyed to see her given how much worry you\u2019ve had, but Annah has yet another new physical change. A great big belly.\n\nYou stare in disbelief.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. This is definitely your work.\u201d Annah says rubbing her belly.\n\u201cIt better damn well be.\u201d You answer.\n\nAfter sorting practical things out, you two surprisingly decide to get married since it seems like the thing to do now. It\u2019s not a big affair, but it\u2019s respectful. Marco is your best man for the lack of anyone else around; he\u2019s overly honored by the position and hopes your first child is a masculine one.\n\nAs strange as this whirlwind is, your thoughts return to the rest of your family. You can\u2019t help but wonder what they\u2019d think of all this.\n\nYou doubt if you\u2019ll ever get a response back, but you write a letter to your mother and father a week after the wedding and explain without too much detail that you\u2019ve gotten married to Annah and are having a family of your own. You tell them you hope that they are doing well and if they ever see your sister to tell her that you hope she is well also.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\n\u201cSo yeah, they\u2019re going to start rebuilding that old Fel temple in the jungle and turning it into a headquarters soon.\u201d Marco tells you.\n\u201cSo Annah told me.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cAll the Black Hooks might soon be incorporated into the Syndicate proper as well, rather than just as associates. I don\u2019t think we would have been considered as quickly without you and your wife\u2019s input.\u201d\n\u201cGood. You guys certainly deserve it, after all the hard work you\u2019ve put in.\u201d\n\u201cUm yeah, so are you going to join the Syndicate too?\u201d\n\u201cMe? I dunno. Been pretty preoccupied what with the family and all.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah I know, but um\u2026well its just if you don\u2019t become a full member, I\u2019ll probably have more authority than you in certain matters. I mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll come to this, but they could even have me take over this major operation here.\u201d\n\nYou smile a bit.\n\n\u201cIs that right? Who said this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNathan, the Syndicate leader here.\u201d Marco says.\n\u201cOf course he did.\u201d\n\u201cI mean I wouldn\u2019t want to do it of course, but I mean order are orders. I mean you know how I really respect everything you\u2019ve done and shit.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Marco, because I\u2019m not. You do what you gotta do and worry about your own future.\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay boss.\u201d\n\nMarco leaves your shop and shake your head at Marco\u2019s almost apologetic warning. The boy would probably hesitate if he actually ever had to go against you. Long enough for you to get the advantage anyway, but you doubt if it would ever come to that.\n\nThe Syndicate has mostly been happy with what you\u2019ve been doing, though they do bring up the fact that you really should become a full member. You think Annah already would have, if not for you dragging your feet on the issue.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure why you are since you\u2019re practically ECS at this point. You suppose there\u2019s just a part of you that doesn\u2019t want to have that final binding agreement since if you do; it really would be for life.\n\nYou suppose the choice might have been easier had you not just had one baby, but twins with Annah. That really complicated everything. (Especially when after they were born, the resemblance to you was unmistakable, so there was no getting out of it)\n\nAnnah at first seemed fine to take a step back from her \u201cjob\u201d to be a mother, and she still doesn\u2019t mind it, but over time she\u2019s been getting antsy. You think it started soon after Checkers died of old age last year. She\u2019s been going on about wanting to get back into things.\n\nIn fact when you return home, you find Annah waiting up for you in the front room. This can\u2019t be good.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk. And I mean talk without raising our voices because I just got Emma and Evan to sleep.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d you respond.\n\u201cI need to get back to work.\u201d\n\u201cWell I said you could help me at my shop, bring the kids along and keep them in the back and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo. Maybe you\u2019re content to sit around and letting your Black Hook kids do your legwork, but I want to be more active than that. Shit, you used to be more active too once.\u201d\n\u201cWell its not like with the Syndicate around I can just go breaking into homes anymore, not that I need to. Besides, as you said, I got the Black Hooks doing shit for me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s another thing. I know a lot of them look up to you like some weird surrogate father figure, but those teenagers are not your children and as loyal as you believe them to be, the Syndicate\u2019s influence is only going to grow and eventually they might not be as reliable as you think they are. Besides, YOU now have real children you need to think about.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you getting at exactly Annah?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to make some really big fucking changes in our lives or we\u2019re going to be fucked over by the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cI might remind you that being all hooked up with the Syndicate was your idea in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, because I see it as an opportunity for both of us. Especially now.\u201d\n\u201cAn opportunity to be indebted to a powerful merciless organization that will punish you severely if you fuck up? I mean I\u2019m really not seeing it as a beneficial thing.\u201d\n\nAnnah rubs her temples with some exasperation before continuing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re REALLY not seeing the benefits we have if we fully commit.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you explain it to me slowly because I know you\u2019ve tried before and I still just don\u2019t get it.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cRook said this whole operation could be ours.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, your buddy in Holgard. That\u2019s why he sent that Nathan guy to oversee things.\u201d\n\u201cHe only sent Nathan because neither one of us are proper ECS members! Of course he\u2019s still going to give preferential treatment to an actual member no matter how much he might like us.\u201d\n\u201cHe might like you, but I\u2019m guessing that stopped when you showed up last time pregnant. And as for me he doesn\u2019t know me so I doubt if he gives a shit.\u201d\n\u201cOkay first off, pretty sure Rook likes men. He\u2019s got some friend called Bolt he\u2019s really close with. I dunno. In any case as I said before, I did many assassin jobs for him in the past successfully so I\u2019ve always had his respect. When I told him just in passing about Sneaks, the guy nearly broke into song and dance. I mean he REALLY hated that guy apparently. His only complaint is that he didn\u2019t get to kill Sneaks himself. I mean just based on THAT deed alone he was ready to hand operations of Jicol over to me. But I\u2019ve explained that before.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, but I just don\u2019t have as much trust in this Rook as you do okay? I mean I hardly believe he\u2019s going to just hand Jicol over to us\u2026or rather you for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course not for nothing, obviously money would have to be kicked up to him, but shit we\u2019re already doing that now to Nathan. I mean if we\u2019re going to be in this position, we might as well have a whole island to run.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I don\u2019t think Nathan\u2019s going to just step aside.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why we kill him and take over.\u201d\n\nYou give a brief chuckle in disbelief.\n\n\u201cSo wait, not only are you suggesting that we join the Syndicate fully, but that we also kill one of its leaders? How the hell does that work?\u201d\n\u201cVery easily. Its not like Rook particularly likes Nathan. He only sent him because I never fully committed. Ultimately Rook isn\u2019t going to care if Nathan dies via an accident. If we get rid of him and those most loyal to him, then boom. We got control of this entire island and all we have to do is send coin back to Rook every once in awhile.\u201d\n\u201cYou do realize that it\u2019s not going to be just be a simple matter of shooting Nathan right? The guy is all wrapped up in that Fel shadow magic shit. And I still don\u2019t see how we can just get away with killing him. I mean I know the Syndicate is ruthless and people get executed for fucking up all the time, but if murdering your immediate superior was so commonly accepted the organization wouldn\u2019t last very long.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re right, but again Nathan really isn\u2019t favored and we\u2019ve got the benefit of being far enough away that we can sort of operate differently around here.\u201d\n\u201cOh right, all of this is supposed to be Rook\u2019s private money making operation so he can gain more power and influence with the Syndicate to shake up the organization or something. Still not keen on being part of that big scheme either. Add the whole increase in Fel worship and it all just seems pretty risky.\u201d\n\u201cOur whole lives have been risky. I mean every time you broke into a home and stole something you were taking a risk. Every day you spend being a criminal is risky. We don\u2019t live nice safe lifestyle in case you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I get that, but there\u2019s still a fucking limit.\u201d\n\nAnnah reaches out to you. You know she\u2019s really trying to convince you now.\n\n\u201cYou say that if we commit that we\u2019re running a high risk. You might be right. However, I\u2019d propose that if we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll run an even higher risk. I mean maybe I\u2019ve never really said this before, but you\u2019ve got more potential than you ever give yourself credit for. I mean look what you did with the Black Hooks. If it wasn\u2019t for the Syndicate you\u2019d be kingpin of Jicol. Hell, you were for a while. I know you partly did everything because this was my idea, but there\u2019s a part of you that still had the desire.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHowever, I get that you\u2019ve always had concerns about all this. And I know we\u2019ve gone back and forth about this a few time before. So, I think if you\u2019re not willing to make that next step, then we need to do something that I believe you\u2019ve probably thought about many times.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\u201cWe relocate. I don\u2019t know where though, I assume you\u2019ve had some thoughts on that matter.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not wrong about relocating. Though unfortunately I don\u2019t have a good idea of where. Preferably a place without any Syndicate influence, though Hessla and Klyton are sort of out of the question in that regard for other reasons. Maybe some place farther north, I\u2019m just not as familiar with many of the settlements that way though. I know they tend to be smaller. Probably more dwarves.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Not exactly ideal.\u201d\n\u201cI know. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t really mentioned it to you. I mean I don\u2019t really want to have to start all over again either. I\u2019ve done it about three times already. And right now, even with the Syndicate looming over us, this has probably been the best set up I\u2019ve had. I just can\u2019t ignore that threat though, even if I do see the logic and benefits in your plan.\u201d\n\nYou and Annah are silent for a moment and then she speaks again.\n\n\u201cWell, I just want you to know, whatever you decide, I\u2019ll follow your lead. I was serious when I said that I want us to work this time. So if that means if we stay here or go north, or if I get back to what I want to do or I have to continue playing full time mom, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d Annah says.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the sacrifice for Annah who has traditionally always done her own thing. Granted she\u2019s changed a lot since being a teenager, but still sort of a switch considering she started this conversation with the desire of wanting to be more active in the business both of you have chosen.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the Syndicate", "result": "Maybe Annah\u2019s right. Maybe you need to just take a risk here. This is the life you\u2019ve chosen and it\u2019s always been full of risk. High stakes mean high reward and Annah seems confident that you can pull this off.\n\n\u201cOkay Annah, we\u2019ll join the Syndicate. I still have my concerns about this idea, but I believe in you and that\u2019s good enough.\u201d You say.\n\nAnnah smiles and hugs you.\n\n\u201cThis is going to work, and we\u2019ll be set, you\u2019ll see.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cSo what do we do exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go down to the Syndicate headquarters, that ruined Fel temple they\u2019re currently cleaning up. And from there I assume Nathan will walk us through the formalities of the oath, then a tattoo and then that\u2019ll be it.\u201d\n\u201cReally? We don\u2019t get beat up or something first?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the Bloody Talons. I mean the Syndicate does ask for people to prove themselves first, but given I\u2019ve always had the favor of Rook and everything we\u2019ve done for the Syndicate, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve more than proven ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cHm, maybe you have, but not sure if that\u2019s extended to me. Besides, I don\u2019t think Nathan\u2019s never been the friendliest so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he wants some sort of extra proving not just for me, but you as well.\u201d\n\u201cEven if he does, it can\u2019t be too outlandish. And if it is, well I suppose we could just kill him first and explain it to Rook afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still concerned about that part of the plan as well. Aren\u2019t those Fel users supposed to be really quick due to their magic?\u201d\n\u201cThey can be, but Nathan\u2019s probably not highly skilled in it. Not to say we shouldn\u2019t still get the drop on him, but it\u2019s not impossible for us to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cSo when are we doing that?\u201d\n\u201cWhen we get the opportunity. The sooner the better. Preferably after we\u2019re officially in the Syndicate, but like I said, if shit happens, then it happens.\u201d\n\u201cWell shit\u2019s definitely going to happen one way or another.\u201d\n\nYou and Annah make plans to meet with Nathan soon, though the first concern is who is going to look after Emma and Evan while you\u2019re both away for this. The only options you can come up with are the Black Hooks have a few mothers that work as nannies.\n\nYou wind up with the least objectionable and competent one and hire her. Annah mentions she wished she\u2019d known about this before, as she wouldn\u2019t have had to play stay at home mom quite as much.\n\nThe next thing happens is Annah goes to see Nathan by herself figuring that she\u2019ll be able to best approach this. You\u2019re a little nervous about her heading to the temple by herself, but she soon returns stating that Nathan was surprisingly very open to the idea.\n\n\u201cWhat seriously? I thought he didn\u2019t care for either of us.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t, he\u2019s either hiding it pretty well now or gotten over it. Said that he even recently received a message from Rook asking if he managed to convince us to properly join yet. He said he\u2019s glad we\u2019re joining since it makes dealing with us a lot easier since he hates dealing with associates and he can now send a message back to Rook to get him off his back about it.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I dunno. Marco mentioned that Nathan\u2019s been talking shit about us, or me at least.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not saying we place complete trust in the guy, just that he\u2019s not giving extra grief about us joining. Said we can come to the temple tomorrow to get everything sorted out. After that, then we can move on to the next step.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should go to the temple together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should go to the temple to together. For all we know Nathan might be planning to kill us too. If we go there together then it\u2019s going to be really easy for him. I\u2019ll go tomorrow by myself.\u201d\n\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true, then I\u2019d stand a better chance against him by myself.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019m not taking that risk with you\u2026I mean I know you\u2019re different, but I let Zalmora go off by herself once and she never came back. At least this way, I\u2019ll just get killed and you can escape if I don\u2019t return.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t return, I hope you realize I wouldn\u2019t run, I\u2019d be trying to avenge you immediately.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you\u2019ll at least have the advantage of being free to do so then.\u201d\n\nAnnah says she understands the logic in your plan, though asks you again if this is what you want to do. You reply that it is and the next day, you head out of Jicol and to the Fel temple where Nathan is waiting for you.\n\nWhen you arrive, you\u2019re met by Syndicate members, who obviously don\u2019t care too much for you and pat you down for weapons before allowing you to go see Nathan who is surprised only to see you.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Annah?\u201d Nathan asks.\n\u201cUnfortunately maternal issues called. She said she apologizes and that she\u2019d be in tomorrow.\u201d You reply which obviously causes a look of annoyance on Nathan\u2019s face.\n\u201cFucking hell, SHE\u2019S the one that saw me about this shit and now she blows me off? I\u2019m doing you both a fucking favor here!\u201d\n\u201cWe understand that and again you have our apologies.\u201d\n\u201cApologies doesn\u2019t make up for my fucking time! She better damn well realize that whether she shit out kids or not is irrelevant to Syndicate business! I mean this isn\u2019t just an insult to the Syndicate, it\u2019s an insult to fucking Fel! We\u2019re in HIS HOUSE!\u201d\n\u201cWell I can make the appropriate sacrifices to him, if\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAppropriate sacrifices, pfft. You\u2019re no believer, whatever you offered would mean shit to him!\u201d\n\nThis is more of the Nathan you expected and you start to wonder if you\u2019re going to get out of this alive. However Nathan instead throws up his hands.\n\n\u201cFine, whatever. Your wife is Rook\u2019s favorite assassin and really wants her in the organization. Far be it from me to piss him off, so tell her to come in tomorrow. In any case, let\u2019s get you sorted out now.\u201d\n\nNathan goes through a surprisingly brief oath that you\u2019re supposed to repeat. He mentions that usually the oath is a bit longer, but since you\u2019re partially being accepted due to Annah and that you\u2019re seen more as a mid level Syndicate supervisor of grunts with no signs of being dedicated to Fel, Nathan feels the basic oath is enough.\n\nWith the oath finished Nathan calls for one of his people to give you a Syndicate tattoo. Since you don\u2019t particularly want it to show in public, you get it on your back, which ends up taking much longer than the oath did. (And a lot more painful)\n\nAfter getting the tattoo, Nathan apathetically mentions you\u2019re now in the Syndicate and dismisses you with some comment about how you need to get the Black Hooks more organized since a lot of them aren\u2019t going to make it into becoming full members in their current state.\n\nYou return back home at night.\n\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re finally back. I was starting to have my own concerns that you were right after all.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cWell he wasn\u2019t pleased that you weren\u2019t there. Went on about his time being wasted, though he acted about how I expected him to which actually put me a little more at ease after I realized he wasn\u2019t going to kill me right then and there. Fortunately he seems to be more concerned with Rook\u2019s approval of you, so he seemed more resigned than anything else.\u201d You say.\n\u201cConnection in high places helps.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, the tattoo took the longest time, and he\u2019ll be expecting you tomorrow. I imagine your oath might be a little longer than mine though.\u201d\n\nYou show your tattoo to Annah, who says she\u2019ll probably get hers on her arm seeing as her back is all scarred up and a tat probably wouldn\u2019t look as good.\n\nThe next day, Annah goes to the temple and you take Evan and Emma with you to your shop. It\u2019s a chore looking after them and focusing on business, but after one of the Black Hook\u2019s nanny mothers shows up, things are a little easier.\n\nYou continue with your work as normal for most of the day. When night falls you don\u2019t think too much about it since you figure the process is taking longer for Annah. You finish up your duties and lock up thinking you\u2019ll be glad when you get rid of Nathan so you won\u2019t have to be concerned with him anymore.\n\nWhen you get home, you expect to be met by a nanny telling you she\u2019s just put the twins to bed or apologizing for failing in the task. Or even better you\u2019d find that Annah has returned.\n\nInstead, as soon as you enter your own home, you feel burning lead slamming into you, causing you to fall to the floor clutching your chest.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?! Nathan wanted him alive you asshole!\u201d a voice shouts.\n\u201cOh shit, I heard the door open and I got nervous!\u201d another voice says.\n\u201cFuck. Well hopefully the two brats are good enough to torture his wife with. Unger is already on his way to the temple with them. Come on let\u2019s get the fuck out of here and leave this fucker to die.\u201d\n\nYou grasp at one the Syndicate member\u2019s legs as they run out the door, but a swift kick soon gets them free. In these last moments you can only assume that Nathan planned a double cross all along. Probably just altered his plans when the pair of you didn\u2019t show up together yesterday.\n\nYou wheeze and cough blood while cursing yourself for taking this foolish risk and can only hope that Annah gets out of this herself because your role in this world is done.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Relocate", "result": "It\u2019s not ideal, but maybe it\u2019s been a long time coming. You need to get out of here before you\u2019re unable to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got coin saved up. Not as much as I\u2019d like, but enough for us to be comfortable for a while. I\u2019ve heard of a port town far to the north on the mainland called Yiktolv that\u2019s supposed to be experiencing a growth boom. Lots of opportunities and such, but apparently very much still a frontier type environment meaning there shouldn\u2019t be much law crawling all over the place. Fairly certain two enterprising people like us could find something to do in such an environment.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, I guess we better make the preparations then. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine. Well, it\u2019s late and we probably should both get some sleep.\u201d Annah says,\n\nYou both head to bed, though you don\u2019t sleep much for several reasons. There\u2019s so much shit you need to get done.\n\nYou spend the next month fencing as much as you can and selling off items that have been in your possession for awhile now at a slightly lower rate. You also start giving Marco a bit more responsibility with the whole debt-collecting thing. At one time you just gave him orders on what you needed, but you start allowing him to see the actual books and lists.\n\nMarco\u2019s smart enough to know something must be up if you\u2019re doing this. You give him a short explanation, which of course he\u2019s not exactly overjoyed to hear you leaving, but he\u2019s grateful that you\u2019re passing your business on to him.\n\n\u201cRemember, I\u2019m handing this to you. Try not to let that asshole Nathan reassign you or some shit. You\u2019ve got a crew. I mean maybe you\u2019re all going to be Syndicate one day, but I assume you had your closest ties with your fellow Black Hooks, so it isn\u2019t like you don\u2019t have any back up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI understand and thanks.\u201d Marco replies.\n\nAfter about two months, you and Annah are pretty much set and you have already made arrangements to board a ship mostly carrying fabric to Yiktolv. Normally such a cargo ship wouldn\u2019t take any old passengers, but enough coin talks. You really only want to take such a ship mainly because its potentially less of a target for pirates. After all you\u2019ve got a trunk full of valuables, along with your family.\n\nAs concerned as you were in beginning about all this, you\u2019re starting to feel more hopeful about this new beginning. Even Annah is sort of looking on the bright side of this endeavor.\n\nThe day you\u2019re scheduled to leave, you, Annah and the twins make your way to the ship with a cart carrying your belonging, but you can\u2019t help have a feeling of unease.\n\nThe ship\u2019s crew takes your things and you board the ship with no problems, but you\u2019re still feeling anxious. You just sense something wrong.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nJust as the ship is about to leave, a bunch of shouting for it to stop along with threats occurs and then you glance over the side and see Nathan, along with several of his Syndicate men begin making their way up the gang plank. Behind them are Marco and several Black Hooks. He looks a little cowed.\n\nNathan just gives a intimidating glance at the captain of the ship who slinks away to his cabin while the rest of his crew also find a way of making themselves scarce.\n\nAnnah shields Emma and Evan and tells them to get behind her. Annah\u2019s good, but you\u2019re not sure with Nathan\u2019s shadow magic powers. And while Marco is here with some of his people, you can\u2019t really be sure he\u2019d help if it really comes down to it. Pressure by a powerful organization can be effective.\n\n\u201cYou planning on leaving before saying goodbye Annah?\u201d Nathan addresses her as if you\u2019re not even around.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know we needed to.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize you wore the pants in the relationship.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, while you may have run your petty crime ring of snot nosed teens before we arrived, everyone knows that Annah\u2019s the real threat here. Shit, I remember how Rook used to love telling stories about her in Holgard. If he wasn\u2019t a pillow biter I would have sworn he was in love with her. Of course that was before she decided to become a brood sow.\u201d\n\u201cNathan, you call my wife a brood sow again, you\u2019re going to see just how dangerous I AM.\u201d\n\u201cOhh! You hear that? The sound of a wounded ego. What do you think of your mentor Marco? You think he could take me?\u201d\n\nMarco doesn\u2019t answer and just looks down. Causing Nathan to get annoyed and walk over to him.\n\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m talking to you boy! Answer the fucking question!\u201d Nathan says smacking Marco upside the head.\n\u201cUm, no sir.\u201d Marco answers meekly.\n\u201cYou see that? Not even your star pupil thinks that highly of you, but as fun as all this is, let\u2019s get to why I\u2019m here. Coin. Coin that belongs to the Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about Nathan? I left instructions and lists with Marco about who owes coin. Not to mention I put aside this month\u2019s cut for the Syndicate and left it at the shop. Shit, I even left a little extra since I figured it would be a gesture of good will.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well that\u2019s thoughtful. Wasn\u2019t that thoughtful lads? The problem is, your good will don\u2019t mean shit. Now you\u2019re not Syndicate and obviously you\u2019re too much of a pussy to join so honestly I don\u2019t give a shit if you leave. Saves me the hassle of having to kill you later since I never thought much of you anyway. In fact the only reason why I\u2019m being THIS generous is despite Annah being a\u2026mother now, I know she\u2019s still deadly with those pistols. I imagine right now, she could take out several of us if this turns unpleasant.\u201d\n\nNathan then turns to walk back towards your direction.\n\n\u201cHowever, as good as she is, she\u2019s not faster than me and more importantly she\u2019s not fast enough to save YOU. So to prevent this from turning unpleasant, all I\u2019m requesting is you hand over ALL your coin. I know you\u2019ve probably got a chest full of it. Call it your exit tax. Do that, and you can be on your way to wherever the fuck you\u2019re scurrying off to.\u201d\n\nYou are feeling an anger right now that you nearly can\u2019t contain. You almost aren\u2019t thinking straight. You look at Nathan\u2019s smug face and you just want to shoot it. You know the reputation of shadow magic and how effective it is. Even Annah has told you some of the things she\u2019s witnessed.\n\nYou\u2019re about to pull your pistol and he looks so eager for you to try. Still, he can\u2019t be THAT fast can he? Even if you missed, sure Annah would be able to\u2026\n\nYou feel a hand on your shoulder, and you turn to look at Annah who just shakes her head a bit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She says.\n\nAnd those words seem to calm you enough to drop your hands to your side.\n\n\u201cTake your tax. It\u2019s in a black trunk below us.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSmart move listening to your woman. She knows all too well the penalties of trying to fuck over the Syndicate. That\u2019s how she got that lovely eye patch isn\u2019t it? Marco, go make yourself useful and go get the fucking trunk.\u201d Nathan says snapping his fingers at him.\n\nMarco and the other Black Hooks head to the lower decks without another word. Meanwhile you go over to be closer with Annah and your children. Nathan of course takes this opportunity to continue to mock you both, presumably to still try to goad you into fight.\n\nSoon, Nathan begins to get more irritated by the fact that Marco hasn\u2019t returned yet.\n\n\u201cFucking hell, what is taking so damn long? Go see what those fucking idiots are doing.\u201d Nathan says to his men who head down below.\n\nNext thing you know, the sounds of shouting followed by fighting can be heard. You can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d Nathan says and moves towards the stairway leading to below decks.\n\nAnd that distraction is all the time Annah needs.\n\nWithout a word, she pushes you to the side, pulls her pistol and unloads it into Nathan. Three of the shots turn his head into a bloody mess before his lifeless body hits the deck.\n\n\u201cQuick, go help your minions, they might need it.\u201d Annah says and starts reloading.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but you have to take advantage where you can. You go down below where you find the Black Hooks fighting it out with the Syndicate. Fortunately for the Hooks, they had the advantage of ambushing them, but it\u2019s still a good thing you\u2019re there to help.\n\nAfter it\u2019s all said and done, you\u2019ve killed them all, though not without casualties. Marco himself is wounded, but alive.\n\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah\u2026ah\u2026fuck.\u201d Marco replies.\n\u201cHm. You realize you just dug a deep hole and jumped waist deep in shit right?\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I just couldn\u2019t stand by and let him horse fuck you like that.\u201d\n\u201cAppreciated. I knew who you\u2019d side with if it came down to it.\u201d\n\u201cIs that asshole dead?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Annah filled him full of holes as soon as the fighting down here occurred. Turned his attention away just for a few seconds and that was it.\u201d\n\u201cGood. But what happens now? Are you still leaving?\u201d\n\u201cGood question.\u201d\n\nYou motion for the remaining Black Hooks to help Marco and you head back to the upper decks where you find Annah trying to calm down a very worried captain. (Though oddly, your two children just stand by unaffected by the situation other than maybe curiosity)\n\n\u201cRelax captain, the Syndicate isn\u2019t going to take it out on you. This will all be taken care of. Just head back in your cabin and when you come back out in a few hours, everything will be fixed and you can be on your way.\u201d Annah says which the captain doesn\u2019t necessarily believe, but he\u2019s scared enough to be hopeful, so he does exactly what Annah says.\n\nYou approach Annah as she\u2019s then asking if Emma and Evan are okay.\n\n\u201cThey seem disturbingly calm about all this, obviously going to grow up to be unfeeling killers like their mother.\u201d Annah remarks to you.\n\u201cI sure hope so. I know I\u2019ll feel safer.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cSpeaking of safety, How exactly are we proceeding with all this? I mean what just happened is what you wanted to avoid.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, but shit happens. Guess we\u2019re staying now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You mean you want to stay and not head to Yiktolv?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fucking point now? I mean we just carried out your plan, we might as well risk it now. If we go running off, I doubt even Rook would look kindly upon killing his representative here without at least replacing him. Not like Marco would be up for that task and the last thing I want to wake up one night in Yiktolv with Syndicate assassins surrounding me. If we get ahead of this, and Rook likes you as much as you and even Nathan said he does, well maybe we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think I can spin all this in a message to Rook. We might need to kick a little extra coin up to him this coming tribute though, just on the safe side.\u201d\n\u201cWell I figured, but we\u2019re sure as shit not paying all of it. Marco and his lot can contribute half that considering he got us into this in the first fucking place. I\u2019d have them pay all of it, but I know those fuckers are still poor for the most part.\u201d\n\nYou and Annah look at one another.\n\n\u201cWell we tried to walk away didn\u2019t we?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cYeah. But things probably would have been the same in Yiktolv. I mean I suppose this way we don\u2019t need to start all over after all. Wasn\u2019t looking forward to that, let me tell you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe it sounds strange, but I feel more positive about our future than I did.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that sounds strange since we could very well be in more danger, but that\u2019s why I love you. Anyway come on and let\u2019s throw this asshole overboard. We\u2019re probably going to have to take care of any other Syndicate members that were loyal to him soon. They\u2019ll probably all be at the temple.\u201d\n\nAfter a few month\u2019s time of \u201cclean up\u201d and coercion, things are settled on Jicol. When news finally reached Rook, he didn\u2019t mind Nathan\u2019s death and was glad to have Annah on board as his new representative on Jicol running things there. (You\u2019ve always been seen as just part of the package even if you\u2019re actually handling more of the business side of things)\n\nYou officially become Ebony Claw Syndicate. You\u2019re supposed to get the tattoo, but you never do since you have the luxury of running things in Jicol and things are a little more lax there as far as \u201cgang formalities\u201d go.\n\nWhile in the scheme of things, you might just be one cog in a larger organization; your simple days as common rogue are definitely over. In any case it doesn\u2019t seem so bad, and besides the fact that you have to split more time with Annah looking after your children, things run more or less smoothly and you\u2019re doing fairly well.\n\nIn fact you wonder why the hell you didn\u2019t just go with Annah\u2019s plan in the first place.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Talk Annah out of this", "result": "Annah might think she has a handle on things and maybe she does, but you need to try to talk her out of getting in too deep with the Syndicate again.\n\nBut you also think that maybe starting with a lecture might not be the way to go about it, so you start with helping her a little.\n\nYou give a rundown on every underworld contact you have of relative importance, along with the strength and numbers of the Black Hooks. You then also give Annah an approximate guess on the strength of the Jicol Watch and how effective they are.\n\n\u201cWould you say they\u2019re susceptible to working with the Syndicate? The Holgard Watch has never been too much of a problem in that regard.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cWell, the Jicol Watch isn\u2019t adverse to a bribe here and there, but the Mayor of Jicol tends to pay them well enough for them to not to make a habit of it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMayor of Jicol? Anything like the Governor of Hessla?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s ten times more reclusive. Apparently most haven\u2019t seen him in decades. About the only descriptions that exist are that the Mayor is male and human, but who knows? In any case, while this place is no stranger to corruption, it still adheres to law and order fairly strongly. Not Klyton level, but that\u2019s probably due to more emphasis on their fleet rather than land force which is thankfully smaller.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. So\u2026you going to go assassinate them all now?\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Well, based on everything you\u2019ve told me, doesn\u2019t seem like I need to bother. I suppose I could anyway. You said you spoke to someone called Sneaks that used to belong to the Thieves Guild in Holgard recently? I bet Rook would want to someone like that taken care of. Maybe the leader of the Black Hooks as well just to keep that group from getting too organized.\u201d\n\nYou just sort of stare at Annah for a moment and exhale a bit while briefly rubbing your hand over your chin. This doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cWhat? Is there some other potential obstacle you haven\u2019t mentioned?\u201d Annah asks.\n\u201cNo. I saw you in action three years ago remember? I have no doubt you\u2019ve only gotten more dangerous since then and are more than a match for anyone here.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cBut, you told me to think about working with you on this Syndicate business and I truly do not see a good ending for us that way if we stick with them and the longer we do it, the harder it\u2019s going to be to get out. I personally don\u2019t want to associate with them. The Black Hooks are about the most I\u2019m going to tolerate for reasons I\u2019ve mentioned. You say you aren\u2019t formally connected with the Syndicate and that\u2019s good, because I think after you do this last job for them, you REALLY need to break ALL ties with them. Things might be going good now, but they might not always be.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that about anything.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I could, but I\u2019m talking about this. Look, you say this Rook fellow isn\u2019t happy with the rest of the Syndicate leadership and he\u2019s trying to build a power base here. This sounds like it\u2019s the prelude to a big internal power struggle, which is likely to escalate very quickly. Now I don\u2019t pretend to know as much about the Syndicate as you do, but from what I gather, any threat to the leadership is going to be met with an extreme use of force to ALL involved. Best thing to do when that happens is to be as far away from the conflict as possible.\u201d\n\nYour words about a potential violent power struggle have weight and she looks as if she didn\u2019t really think about that before.\n\n\u201cHm. You might have a point about that. I\u2019m going to have to think on that.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cAnnah, I\u2019d rather you not think and just do what I tell you.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell apologies, but that\u2019s not the kind of woman I am. Pretty sure you know that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t I know it\u2026\u201d you say and then start chuckling.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\u201cI was just thinking about how many times back in Teckleville I used to go out my mind telling you to do something and you\u2019d just blatantly ignore me.\u201d\n\u201cTeckleville\u2026seems like a lifetime ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s weird though sometimes I still think about the place and my family. Wonder how my mom and dad are doing. Probably living a safe and boring life. Drama free life too without me around. I guess if we\u2019d stayed our lives would\u2019ve eventually been safe and boring too.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you almost got killed there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Can\u2019t go home again anyway.\u201d\n\u201cIs\u2026that what you want?\u201d\n\u201cEh. I mean when was running a semi-legitimate business, I thought it was a little dull at times, but there was sort of a relief that I wasn\u2019t looking over my shoulder every five minutes. But of course after that all was over, I obviously went back to my old ways.\u201d\n\u201cAny particular reason why you did?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Just habit I guess. Plus, wasn\u2019t like I had a reason to really go legit anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSo it took the love of honest woman to make you settle down?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t call Zalmora an honest woman, she was an ex-Talon. Just had more sense than the rest. I dunno, I liked her and she liked me and I thought you were gone for good so I suppose I just latched on to her.\u201d\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t love her?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I mean fuck, I dunno. I assume I must have on some level. What\u2019s with all the questions?!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, relax. Just asking. I\u2019m not mad or anything. I mean it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t meet someone during my eventful stay in the Delantium Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You never mentioned that during our last meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWell I was still sorting it out then not to mention all that other shit with you went down. Wasn\u2019t really a good time for the story.\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess. It involved the Ebony Claw Syndicate.\u201d\n\u201cYeah he was definitely a Syndicate member. Met him by chance, but had years of fun with him. Had so much fun that he got the fool notion to want to run away with me with a bunch of the Syndicate\u2019s coin. Sure you know how that one turned out.\u201d\n\nYou nod and don\u2019t say anything while she continues.\n\n\u201cFunny thing is, I thought for a brief moment that I\u2019d put you behind. I\u2019d gotten over you. I mean I THOUGHT what I had for him was love. But it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh? What was it then?\u201d\n\u201cDistraction. I mean what we were doing was wild and exciting. Defying the law, ripping off the Syndicate, I probably loved all that more than him. Didn\u2019t really realize that until I was being fucking tortured and I gave him up so easily.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh sure, I held out a bit, but honestly most of the shit the Syndicate did to me was AFTER I gave up his secret hiding spot. I imagine they would have done much worse or killed me had I not given him up so easily. You know they killed him right in front of me, after they tortured the both of us. Even when they told him how I gave him up, he wasn\u2019t mad he just kept pleading for them not to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess you did what you had to.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right I did. And I don\u2019t feel any remorse about it. I mean at first I was upset, but I think that was mostly from the physical torture and fear that I was also going to die that night. As for him? All I could think is how foolish he was for falling for me in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s some cold shit\u2026but again I get it.\u201d\n\u201cAfter I was let go, I dwelled on all of it for very long time. I wondered if I was evil or crazy, even wondered if I was possessed by a demon. However when I found you again in that store in Hessla, all those old feelings I felt for you, they came back and I was right. You would always be my one and only.\u201d\n\nAnnah puts her hands in her face and you can tell she\u2019s starting to get emotional.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I guess I just wanted to know if you really loved another even briefly and the reasons. As I said, I don\u2019t care, but the fact that you were able to move on and I wasn\u2019t, the fact that you don\u2019t kill unless you have to, while I\u2019ve done it without hesitation says a lot about me. (sniffle) Namely\u2026I\u2019m fucked up. I don\u2019t know if I got that way over time, or it was always there.\u201d\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t call myself a beacon of role model behavior Annah. I mean I haven\u2019t been tortured by the ECS or had the same experiences you\u2019ve had. All that plays a part and take a toll. There\u2019s still A LOT we don\u2019t know about each other and missing gaps, despite the fact that we seem to be drawn to each other. Maybe if we talked more\u2026\u201d\n\nAnnah immediately goes to kiss you.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk anymore. I just want to feel you inside me again. I want you to love me again.\u201d She says and continues to kiss you while trying to strip off her clothing.\n\nYou proceed to help her achieve her desires.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve been intimate with her like this. Even as forward as she was with the initiation of this, she suddenly becomes unsure when your hands embrace her and run across her back. She even attempts to pull away a little, but you reassure her that it\u2019s okay and that you don\u2019t care.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure why, but you also feel the need to mention that you cleared up that shit you caught from Flameflower (whatever the hell it was). Oddly, you don\u2019t think it would even matter to Annah right now, but she gives a brief smile at your insistence of being\n\nLater...\n\nYou wake up to Annah laying next to you dressed again and just staring at you.\n\n\u201cI know, I know. Watching you sleep is probably creepy.\u201d Annah remarks.\n\u201cConsidering I once woke up after you drugged me and robbed me blind, this is a lot more preferable. What the hell\u2026\u201d you reply when you feel a wetness on your hand that\u2019s hanging over the bed.\n\nYou look over briefly and realize its Checkers licking your hand. You sit up and move your hand away.\n\n\u201cHm, uncharacteristically friendly of Checkers to be licking my hand rather than biting my ankle.\u201d You say.\n\u201cShe likes you, you know.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cWell the furry beast has participated in saving my life a few times, so I guess she\u2019s alright. Has she grown at all? She looks about the same size when I first saw her.\u201d\n\u201cNot much. Just grown older I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHappens to the best of us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like to think about how her years are probably coming to an end soon though. Weird, I know considering what I\u2019ve been doing the last few years.\u201d\n\u201cWell seems like she\u2019s had a good life under your care. Whatever else you may be thinking about yourself Annah, you\u2019ve got a nurturing side to you.\u201d\n\nYou give Checkers a pet and get up to get dressed. Annah continues to go from watching you and staring at nothing in particular. By the time you\u2019re half dressed, she suddenly gets up.\n\n\u201cHey, so I gotta go now. Best that I get this information back to the Syndicate and all.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving? Already?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, no point in sticking around. If the Syndicate wants anyone wiped out, they can do it themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAh. So you\u2019re taking my advice and this is going to be your last job with them?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I thought about it and you\u2019re right. I need to do something else with my life. This\u2026path with or without the Syndicate that I\u2019m on really isn\u2019t the healthiest. I don\u2019t sleep much, I\u2019m constantly looking over my shoulder, well you know how it is.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know how it can get. And I imagine for you it\u2019s worse. So what are you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, guess I\u2019ll have to figure that out. In any case, you might want to start thinking about relocating yourself. Not immediately, but y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cI could just come with you right now. I mean its not like I\u2019m tied to this place.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like that, I think I need to work some things out. Last thing I want to do is destroy what little we still have left due to some stupid argument we\u2019re going to inevitably get into.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, I don\u2019t really get this. I mean it\u2019s obvious you want to get back together and I\u2019m open to it, so I don\u2019t see the need for you to just go wandering off again. We\u2019re obviously both different than we were thirteen years ago. Whatever personal demons and shit we got to deal with, we can deal with them together.\u201d\n\u201cRemember how you weren\u2019t ready the last time we met up? It wasn\u2019t your fault or my fault, just bad timing?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is yet another case of that. I got shit going on in my head that I don\u2019t even want to heap on you. Your life as it is right now, is calm. I know you. You like to keep things simple. That\u2019s probably why you nearly went legit with Zal. It was easier and more convenient at the time since that\u2019s the way life seemed to be heading. When it was gone, you fell back into the old ways, because again it was easy and familiar. While I know I\u2019m familiar, I\u2019m definitely NOT easy to be with. I don\u2019t know what the future for me holds. Everything is always a whirlwind of thrills and not always in a good way. You don\u2019t want to deal with that and I don\u2019t want you to have to deal with it. At least not until I believe I\u2019ve got my shit together enough that it\u2019s not going to fuck up your feelings for me.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, unless you shot me in the dick or something, whatever you got going on right now isn\u2019t likely to change how I feel, but fine. I won\u2019t bother arguing with you even though I really want to. Obviously you feel strongly about this, so once again I\u2019ll see you when I see you and hopefully whenever that is, you won\u2019t be affiliated with these Syndicate assholes again.\u201d\n\nAnnah touches your face and smiles a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d She says and kisses you goodbye before calling Checkers to follow her.\n\nAnd once again Annah\u2019s gone. One of these days the pair of you are going to get your timing right.\n\nIn the meantime, you at least got some knowledge about what changes are about to come to Jicol even if not immediately. You figure you\u2019ll stick around for now and see how things go.\n\nMaybe you can even prepare for the coming storm.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time passes...", "result": "Year 32\n\n\u201cSo yeah, they\u2019re going to start rebuilding that old Fel temple in the jungle and turning it into a headquarters soon.\u201d Marco tells you.\n\u201cHm, looks like the Syndicate is moving quicker everyday.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah, but its good. I mean I know you told us all to watch our asses, but so far the Syndicate members that we\u2019ve had dealings with have all been pretty reasonable guys. Even said that the Black Hooks could be fully incorporated as full members in a year or so. We\u2019ve been doing a lot better in general.\u201d\n\u201cWell glad to hear it. Maybe I was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I guess you were just looking out for us like you always have. Y\u2019know, you should join too! You\u2019re really skilled and the Syndicate is looking for members like that!\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. A couple of them have approached me a few times, but I\u2019m just not interested.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but if you joined you wouldn\u2019t need to pay protection and you\u2019d be able to do whatever you wanted!\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure I wouldn\u2019t be able to do WHATEVER I wanted. It\u2019s not like the old days where you can just break and enter into anywhere. Thanks, but I\u2019m good with what I\u2019m doing now. Anyway, what\u2019s the Syndicate tax this month? Did it go up to help rebuild the temple?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s the same, but you know you don\u2019t need to worry about it. I got you covered, but I just don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m gonna be able to. Sooner or later the Syndicate might get one of their guys to start doing the collecting. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to become a real member soon!\u201d\n\u201cThanks as usual Marco, but don\u2019t worry yourself too much about it. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026see you later then. And thanks for unloading that other stuff for me.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. Later Marco.\u201d\n\nMarco leaves your \u201cshop\u201d and you just shake your head and smile at what a few little words of encouragement and support can do to mold a young mind. Marco probably sees you as the dad he wished he had. You imagine some of the other Black Hooks d too.\n\nWhich of course is handy since its paid off as far as you not really having to kick anything up to the Syndicate whose presence has becoming more noticeable in last few months. Might be time to leave soon. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019ll go though.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pondering this, the door opens and someone comes in.\n\n\u201cSon, you and I need to have a long talk.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s older (But to you he was always old and unfun) but you\u2019d never mistake his face or his voice.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOf course its me!\u201d he responds.\n\u201cWh\u2026what the hell are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not something I wanted to do, but after a long talk with your mother, its what we both decided in the hopes that you\u2019ve still got it in you to do the right thing. Call us hopeless optimists.\u201d\n\u201cYou came all the way here to give me a lecture after nearly twenty years? How the hell did you even find me?!\u201d\n\u201cAnnah told us. Well told us where your last where abouts were anyway. She said you\u2019d probably still be here since you\u2019ve always had a tendency to stay put unless you absolutely have to move, which sounds about right.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019ve spoke to Annah?! When?\u201d\n\u201cNearly on a daily basis, for the past couple years. Pretty much ever since she come back to Teckleville and had the babies.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve got twins you\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nYou are getting flooded with so much information right now that you can\u2019t even process it all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026impossible. Last time I saw Annah was two years ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well that timeline matches up since that\u2019s how old they are. Look, I delivered them myself, not to mention they look like you and your sister. You\u2019re definitely the father, despite Annah trying not to admit it. That didn\u2019t last long though, since I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why she came back to Teckleville in the first place. She knew your mother and I wouldn\u2019t NOT help her.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2026don\u2019t believe it. I mean\u2026and I hate even asking this, are you REALLY sure? I mean maybe this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs what? A scam to get money from us? Boy, I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. I told you, the two little buggers look like you and your sister. The genetics are impossible to ignore. I mean the hair is darker and there\u2019s a difference in eye color, but there\u2019s no mistake. Shit, I even hired a wizard from Klyton to double check. They\u2019re definitely your work.\u201d\n\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s what got you into this mess. Anyway, this brings me to why I\u2019m here. YOU need to come back and take responsibility. I understand you\u2019re off having fun being a criminal, but even Annah gave that up after having children. They need a father and your mother and I need a fucking a break. Our days of running about catching two twin terrors are supposed to be over.\u201d\n\u201cWait, why are you just now coming to get me then?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I wanted to get you a lot sooner. However Annah always claimed that she didn\u2019t know where you were. Having raised two of the best liars, I knew she wasn\u2019t telling the truth, but I always assumed you pissed her off and she didn\u2019t want you involved. However, thanks to your mother\u2019s monthly interrogating via niceness, Annah finally broke down a few months ago and as it turned out Annah just didn\u2019t want you to put your own life on hold for this. She said she\u2019d put you through enough trouble in the past. Ain\u2019t that sweet?\u201d\n\u201cSounds like her.\u201d\n\u201cAlso sounds fucking retarded. Why the hell should you get to continue to live without care and responsibility? Your mother of course thought you should come back too, but she was worried about me going to get you. Thought we should hire bounty hunters to find you, but I figured I\u2019d make more of an impression and you\u2019re probably already adept at avoiding capture anyway. So here I am.\u201d\n\u201cYes, so here you are. You might have been better off going with mom\u2019s idea though. At least you would have had a better chance of getting me back to Teckleville. Speaking of which, how the hell can I go back anyway? Aren\u2019t I wanted for murder there?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah, no. That actually got settled shortly after you ran off with Annah. Some of the witnesses to the fight admitted Klint started it and you killing him was more of an accident and even self defense.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cNope. Surprised me too. Not that you weren\u2019t a murderer, since I figured Klint started it because he was an asshole like his father, but that people actually came around and spoke up in your favor. Anyway, the charges were dropped which pissed off Klint\u2019s dad who left the village swearing revenge and that was about the end of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m completely free and clear?\u201d\n\u201cYep. Have been for years now. The old sheriff is dead now anyway, so it\u2019s not even like you have worry about him either. In fact Annah, works as a deputy of the town now, so you\u2019ve got a lot of breathing room as far as your shady past is concerned.\u201d\n\u201cAnnah\u2019s a\u2026what the\u2026well I guess she found something new to do like she said she would.\u201d\n\u201cYep. And it\u2019s time you do as well.\u201d\n\nYour dad sees the apprehensive and non-committal look on your face and sighs.\n\n\u201cAnd of course you\u2019re going to be stubborn about this\u2026\u201d he remarks.\n\u201cDad, I appreciate the update and all this news about Annah, but this is a lot to fucking take in! I mean I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s told you, but our relationship isn\u2019t exactly the most stable. I mean its not like she came here herself and TOLD me about her being pregnant. Shit, she didn\u2019t even tell you and Mom where I was until recently like you said. I might not have even been here anymore. Obviously she thinks we\u2019re better off apart.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit, if she really thought that, she wouldn\u2019t have come back home at all. She knew your mother and I would help her. Gods know her own lush of a mother isn\u2019t going to help. Look, I\u2019m not some relationship expert, but obviously you two have enough chemistry between each other that you got yourselves into this mess.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but kids didn\u2019t really play a part in any of it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well shit happens. You think your mother and I planned for twins? Also didn\u2019t plan on you two being criminals. Still don\u2019t know why the hell you two turned out the way you did considering you had everything.\u201d\n\u201cHere we go, another lecture\u2026I\u2019m not a fucking teenager anymore dad.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right you aren\u2019t, which is why its time you stopped fucking acting like one and take some responsibility for a fucking change! What the hell do you have going on that\u2019s oh so fucking important right now? From what I can tell this dump you\u2019re living in, you aren\u2019t exactly living some carefree life of a swashbuckler like in those badly written novels. What, you spend all the coin you steal on wine and whores?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I live frugally and save very carefully.\u201d\n\u201cWell great. Good for you. Glad to hear you\u2019re a thrifty thief. Actually explains a lot. Now, if you\u2019ve got so much coin saved up, you\u2019ve got enough to support your children.\u201d\n\u201cIs this what it\u2019s ultimately about? Fine, I\u2019ll go empty out my safe and you can take it all to give to Annah and the kids.\u201d\n\nYour father suddenly gives you a minor tap upside your head. It\u2019s unexpected and you almost feel like you\u2019re ten years old again.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d you utter.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about money, this is about responsibility and YOU needing to fucking take some! Your children need their father, you\u2019ve already missed some of it, you really want to miss it all?\u201d your father says.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it? Obviously you think I\u2019m a no good vagabond, so I would make a terrible father.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you would, but I don\u2019t think so. Surprised to hear me say that?\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not saying it to boost your ego, I\u2019m saying it because I believe based on what Annah\u2019s told me about you and the boy I used to know. There is a streak of responsibility in you. I mean even as a thief you\u2019re obviously preparing for the future by saving your ill-gotten loot. I remember how you always stuck by your sister and tried to take the blame for some of the more serious shenanigans you two got up to. It looks like you\u2019re running some sort of shop here and Annah\u2019s said you\u2019ve run a shop in the past with some other woman that you apparently had a stable relationship with. You\u2019ve got it in you to be a contributing member of society.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\u201cWell you won\u2019t know unless you try and you might as well try with a family. As far as you and Annah are concerned, well I don\u2019t know if you two are going to be a proper husband and wife. I mean it\u2019ll be good if you can, and I\u2019m inclined to believe you two are still in love. However, if that doesn\u2019t work out, you should at least still be there for your children.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ll just be a bad influence?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that you won\u2019t to some degree, however I also don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to want to put up with the headache of raising two little criminals. I know Annah certainly won\u2019t and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d want to be on her bad side. What the hell happened to her anyway? I swear she can shoot the wings off a fly.\u201d\n\u201cLong story, though I don\u2019t know all of it since she\u2019s never told me the whole story about her adventures during our times away from each other either.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe that\u2019s something you can finally catch up on and bond over. Besides, y\u2019know, your kids of course.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nYour father puts a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\u201cLook, this has been an exciting adventure for me and all, but I really want to get back home before your mother starts hiring a search party. I need to know if you\u2019re coming with me or not. It\u2019s a simple answer that doesn\u2019t require much overthinking. If you are, let\u2019s get going now. If you aren\u2019t, then I won\u2019t bother you again with this.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with your father", "result": "It\u2019s a strange position that you never thought you\u2019d ever be in, but you\u2019re in it and even stranger, you\u2019re ready to embrace it.\n\nOne thing your father said that convinced you the most was the question of \u201cWhat are you doing that\u2019s so important?\u201d\n\nNothing. You are not doing anything of major importance. If anything, you\u2019re probably living just as boring of a life in Jicol as you would in Teckleville. You haven\u2019t actually done any real thieving since the Syndicate started making more of a presence here, you do more middle man merchant shit than anything else.\n\nYou could leave and start over elsewhere which is what you thinking about doing anyway. But if you\u2019re going to do that, you might as well have a better purpose than just doing the same thing again.\n\nBesides, you\u2019ve done fairly well in this profession all things considered. You might as well \u201cretire\u201d ahead of the game before something REALLY bad happens to you. This might as well be your out as it were. Not to mention, Annah\u2019s saved your life several times over. The least you could do to repay her is to help out with your spawn.\n\nThat\u2019s going to be weird though. You suppose you\u2019ll just have to muddle through that, hopefully better than your own parents did.\n\n\u201cOkay dad, I\u2019ll come with you, but need to get some things first and make some arrangements.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBy the gods, you actually listened to me for once. I\u2019m not going to question it, but glad to see I finally got through.\u201d Your father says in partial disbelief and relief.\n\nTo ensure a safe trip home with your savings, you hire a few mercenaries to escort you to Klyton. From there you figure you shouldn\u2019t have much problem.\n\nYou also leave your \u201cshop\u201d and home to Marco and his group, though you don\u2019t tell him that immediately, you write a message and hand it to a courier to give it to Marco in a few days. Just a simple note not explaining where you went, just that you had to leave and that they can do whatever they want with the property.\n\nFinally you board a ship heading to Hessla with your father (and your small retinue).\n\nWhile you\u2019re on board, your father has one more surprise for you that you have plenty of time to talk about along the way.\n\n\u201cOh by the way son, I guess I might as well tell you, you\u2019ve got a younger brother now.\u201d Your father says.\n\u201cWHAT?! How?!\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure you\u2019re familiar with the process.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. I\u2019m talking about you and mom. I mean you guys are old!\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, we\u2019re weren\u2019t THAT old when you and your sister took off. True, we sort of thought that part of our lives was over, but soon after you were gone, I guess nature decided to give us another chance to get it right. And we did. Adam has never been a problem child.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well congratulations I guess. Another new family member for me to meet I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of family, you know anything about your sister? Any contact with her at all?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I do wonder what she\u2019s been up to though. Always hope she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cShe is as far as I know. Your mother and I get occasion messages from her. Not many and the last one I think was a few years ago but she said she was doing fine. Having her own adventures no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well I\u2019m glad to hear that. Hope that\u2019s still the case. I miss her.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother and I do as well. Despite her criminal ways, she was always creative. Just wish she put more into that instead of\u2026well unlawful behavior. Still, I guess she has been doing that from some of the stuff she\u2019s written to us.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the trip is mainly you catching up with your father. It\u2019s odd, but neither of you really argues once. You even laugh and joke a few times. You don\u2019t tell him everything that happened though. Some things you just would rather leave buried. At least for now.\n\nYour father never really presses you for too much information anyway. He probably doesn\u2019t want to know some of what you were involved in. Although there is one question\u2026\n\n\u201cJust wondering, I mentioned Klint\u2019s father left Teckleville muttering about revenge. My guess is he went to go look for you. You never ran into him did you?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Can\u2019t say I ever did.\u201d\n\u201cI only ask since you mentioned you ran to Klyton, and my guess is that\u2019s where he first went to look for you. I asked Annah once and she said she never bumped into him either. Still, seems strange he never came back here.\u201d\n\u201cDad, if he did, you know Klyton\u2019s a huge city. I mean it wasn\u2019t like I was making myself well known there either. If he did go there, he must have given up and went elsewhere. Not exactly like safe travels are a sure thing, hence why I hired mercs for part of our trip.\u201d\n\nYour father looks at you a moment. You already know he\u2019s trying to see if you\u2019re lying.\n\n\u201cOkay. Just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if your father believes you or he just doesn\u2019t care and was merely curious. Either way, he doesn\u2019t press the issue.\n\nYou eventually reach Hessla, then Klyton and from Klyton you start the last stretch of your trip in the carriage ride to Teckleville. That\u2019s when you begin to get nervous. You didn\u2019t think that would happen, but you begin to get so nervous that its visibly noticeable to your father.\n\n\u201cNot having second thoughts I hope.\u201d Your father says.\n\u201cNo, not at this point. Too late to turn back now. Fuck\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cSon, you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll soon realize this isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThink of it this way. What\u2019s the worst thing that has ever happened to you? Don\u2019t tell me if you don\u2019t want. Just think about it. Now with that in mind, do you have ANY thought that reuniting with Annah and seeing your children for the first time is going to be remotely worse than that?\u201d\n\nYou think for a moment, wincing a bit about your encounter with Flameflower.\n\n\u201cNo. Definitely can\u2019t be anywhere near as bad.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, see? There you go then.\u201d You father says and then pats you on the shoulder a couple times.\n\nWhich is easy for dad to say considering he doesn\u2019t really know the extent of just how bad that event was. In any case, you manage to calm yourself down and just try to rest before you get to your destination.\n\nEventually you reach Teckleville during the night. Your father wakes you up.\n\n\u201cGet up, we\u2019re here. I\u2019ll help the driver get your things off the carriage, in the meantime you go knock on the door and make your presence known.\u201d Your dad says.\n\u201cWha? Wait, where exactly are we?\u201d you ask half asleep.\n\u201cTeckleville, ya idjit. We\u2019re near Annah\u2019s home. Still early in the night so you probably aren\u2019t going to be waking her up.\u201d\n\u201cShit. I\u2019m really here. Okay, well guess nothing to it, but to do it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nYou get out of the carriage and your dad once again points to the house where Annah lives. Fairly small, but then, probably doesn\u2019t need too much room and this is the best she could do.\n\nYou have no idea why you\u2019re still so nervous. You\u2019ve bumped into Annah several times in the past after long stretches of being separated. Why is this different?\n\nOh right.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s different is you\u2019re seeking her out, or rather your dad dragged you to her. In most other instances, she\u2019s always been the one to go to you. She didn\u2019t even tell you about being pregnant. She could have at least got a message to you or something if she really thought it was important for you to know. Apparently she didn\u2019t.\n\nYou know what your father said her reasoning was, but maybe she really just wanted to make a clean break. Start fresh. Maybe you being here isn\u2019t what she would want at all. For all you know she\u2019s going to tell you to get right back on that carriage and go away.\n\nYou march up to the door and before you can even knock, the door opens.\n\n\u201cAnnah. I\u2026\u201d you start to say before she immediately hugs and kisses you.\n\nWell so much for her telling you to go away. Apparently the love is still there.\n\n\u201cYour mother told me your father went to get you. When I heard the carriage outside I just hoped it was you!\u201d Annah exclaims with some emotional tears in her eyes.\n\u201cAnnah, why didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! It was stupid, but I just thought\u2026I dunno a part of me just didn\u2019t think you needed to be saddled with all this. But I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here now! You\u2019re back right? You\u2019re not going anywhere right?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know I\u2019m not going anywhere Annah.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m so glad. We\u2019ll finally be a proper family.\u201d\n\nAs you embrace Annah\u2019s tight hold on you and those words of being a \u201cproper family\u201d you feel a small part of your old life slipping away.\n\nNot really in a bad way, but you really know now for certain that things are never going to be the same. You\u2019re going to have to find something legitimate to do. You doubt even fencing stolen goods is going to be something you can engage in around here. You\u2019ll think of something though.\n\nYour father and driver drop your trunk of stuff near you.\n\n\u201cWell I can see you two got a lot to talk about. I\u2019ll leave you to it. Your mother will probably be by to see you tomorrow so expect to see her.\u201d Your dad says as the driver walks away back to the carriage.\n\u201cUm, okay dad. And thanks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm. Told you, it would be fine.\u201d\n\nSoon, the carriage is gone and so is your father, leaving you and Annah alone.\n\nWell not totally alone.\n\n\u201cSo hey let me help you get that trunk in and you can finally meet your son and daughter.\u201d Annah says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll get the trunk.\u201d You say and take one side of the hefty trunk and drag it just inside the house.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually told them about you a few times.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Hopefully just the good stuff, because I\u2019m sure their grandfather will be more than willing to tell them the bad.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you to them.\u201d\n\nAs the front door closes and Annah takes your hand, you realize your life as a rogue is over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Refuse the call", "result": "While there is a part of you that feels sort of shitty about this, you don\u2019t feel like you have some obligation to go back to Teckleville. Annah obviously didn\u2019t want you involved otherwise she would have told you (or even your family) a lot sooner than she did.\n\nIn fact this makes you sort of reconsider your relationship with Annah in the first place. Sure, you two have love for one another, but it\u2019s always been the same and you two never stay together for whatever reason. If you go back, why should this time be any different? Might even be worse with children involved, you really don\u2019t think you\u2019d make that great of a father. You\u2019d feel trapped for one thing.\n\nMaybe you\u2019d feel different if it was just you and Annah settling down and living somewhere other than Teckleville together. You nearly did it before with Zalmora.\n\nHell, you don\u2019t necessarily need anyone.

You\u2019re making this quick because arguing with him is a pointless endeavor.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d your dad asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s everything I have in the shop.
