The orcs didn't want anything to do with them and their magic.  The next time the elves showed up; however, it was in force.  Looking to capture conscripts for their fight against the Empire.  The orcs wanted nothing to do with their war, but since the elves brought it to our doorstep, we had now come to retaliate. \n\n\nThe elves, unable to fight a war on two fronts, were sure to crumble. \n\n\nBut this all started four years ago.

Across is another ridge, with orcs similarly stationed.  In between, dozens and dozens of orcs slowly advance: hiding in trenches, behind rocks, and amidst piles of dead comrades.  They will never make it through unless you buy them time. \n\n\nAhead, the elves had constructed wooden walls and towers.  Each had slits and ramparts to shoot their arrows and blast their magic. \n\n\nScanning the area, you see that the elve's defenses are strongest on their right flank. Perfect.

They must be expecting the orcs to charge at any minute and are planning a surprise in the trenches.\n\n\nYou inspect the trench immediately below you.  It leads directly to the door of a tower.  You see an officer using a dimly glowing spyglass.  Near him, and scattered throughout the trenches, are wounded elves.  Some fit to fight, some are not, and yet they'll do it regardless.  You have to respect that at least.\n\n\nYou ready your bow, and sight an elf slumped against the trench wall.  Bloody bandages wrapped around his head, he holds his dagger and appears to be praying.

It instead slips from his fingers.  His hand goes for his dagger, but before he can do anything else, your stolen sword is buried in his chest.\n\n\nWith a grunt you push it the rest of the way through, all the way to the hilt, specks of his warm blood spattering your arms and chest.

One leaps over the dying orc, almost hacking into your shoulder.  You get a lucky dodge, this time drawing your real sword.\n\n\nThe other one comes from your side, intent on plunging his spear into your side.  You knock the spearhead away, sliding the blade along the shaft, until you reach his hand.  You simply pull your blade back real quick, then with a quick chop severing his fingers.  He cries out in pain, turning into a gurgling as you slash your sword across his throat.\n\n\nThe last orc, and probably the most resourceful.  Pulls up a small shield from his side, frisbee whipping it at you.  It hits your raised forearm, leaving a stinging mark on your arm.\n\n\nAs you step back, the other orc tucks and rolls, grabbing the spear.  As he raises into a kneel, he lurches the spear forward.  It buries into your waist, burning hot pain shoots through.  You roar in pain as he rips it out.

His raven dark hair contrasted by a multitude of grey hairs throughout.  His face turns up into a weary smile.  His dark green skin hiding him well, until he steps into the rays of light.\n\n\n\"Welcome, friend,\" he says.  \"I am Chief Hidius.\"\n\n\n\"I am Nolazir.\"\n\n\nIt is just then that you notice the severe burn marks covering Hidius' body.

Living, dead, hell, Empire, whatever it may be.  We don't just lay down and die.\"\n\n\nThe chief smiles slowly.\n\n\n\"While that may be true of you and yours, I am old and tired of fighting.

Fools.\"\n\n\nWhile you can see the logic in his anger, something seems off. \n\n\n\"And the rest?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Not so keen on the idea of conceding land yet,\" Galik says, \"but it was only a matter of time before the traitor would get them to turn over.

His sword lays behind you, which he had dropped when you knocked him over.\n\n\n\"Well, what are you waiting for, Nolazir?\"\n\n\nYou take a step forward, raising the sword.

While there are plenty of experienced veterans in your army, the number of young, inexperienced, and foolhardy orcs concerns you.\n\n\nTraditionally, orcs have always set out as adults at the age of fifteen.  What this usually means for them is going out and finding adventure and fighting things.  Because of your warlike nature, many orcs do not actually live too long.

Roaring, you charge forward.\n\n\nRolomag starts to divert troops.\n\n\n\"No,\" you cry, \"stay focused.  I've got this.\"\n\n\nAs you ride by, you see Grolik's eyes glazed, and staring into the sky.  The arrow having gone straight through his heart, and spilling his spirit into the void.  Orcs continue to fall, as the diversion weakens your center line.  The humans in the center gain no ground, but don't lose any either.\n\n\nSomething else in the distance disturbs you.  Circling around, a large cavalry rides through the open plain.  Between the mountains and the forest they go, sweeping into your left flank.  Hidius is just able to mount his horse, fighting off a knight.  You howl in agony as another one rides up behind Hidius, planting his sword through his back.\n\n\nHidius falls quietly, and almost immediately.  Somewhere in the fray, you see Silak defending his chief's corpse before himself being killed.  As you rally troops to defend this side, Gro'tesk glances to you, his eyes flashing in anger.\n\n\nThe lines and columns are all in a frenzy, being attacked viciously from multiple sides.  There is no semblance of lines and divisions.  All the orcs fight as one, the Imperials slowly pushing through with reinvigorated fury. \n\n\nSlamming the butt of your axe into a hapless soldiers helmet, you let out a roar.  His helmet pinging and denting under your blow, his eyes bloodshot from the trauma.  The soldier twitches before laying still.\n\n\nThe horse you are on cries out in agony, a couple of arrows piercing its chest.  Managing to leap off, you roll to the ground and stand bearing both weapons.  Just in time to meet the blades of bloodthirsty soldiers. \n\n\nHacking, slashing, and bashing you stand by your brethren.  As you remove the head of one soldier, another's spear finds its way through your armor.  Your mouth gapes in pain but you stay silent, grimacing and facing the soldier, you knock his spear away.\n\n\nWith a grunt you shove the sword blade under his helmet and into his face.  Specks of crimson blood cover your arms as the soldier writhes, twitches, and dies.  On the right flank, the Imperials push Rolomag's line ever closer to this one.  The center also being pushed back.\n\n\nRolomag, with several injuries, gives you a weary nod.  You are about to return it when Rolomag huffs and falls, an axe buried in his back.  Ahead of you, a beast of a man wrenches the axe from your fallen friend's back.\n\n\nYou charge each other, weapons sparking and colliding.  Grinning, you slam the spike atop your axe into the man's ribs.  He ignores the pain and hacks into your side, breaking through the armor and embedding his axe into your ribs.\n\n\nTwisting, you make him lose his grip.  Your sword buries into the human's neck as his eyes widen in surprise.  Before you can twist the sword out, a burning sensation shoots through your side.\n\n\nThe axe blade twists through your side snapping ribs and almost blinding you with pain.  Before you can move, the axe blade slams into your helmet.  As this happens a hand pushes you down, before you can twist around the handle slams into your helmet as well.\n\n\nIt's not long before various weapons slam into your armor or pierce through it and into your flesh.

Also, as I'm sure you know, make sure the village is kept safe\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\nGreusim gets into the specifics of running the village day to day, and while some of it sounds kind of boring, you realize those are the things that must be done to keep the village together.\n\n\n\"Gigalak didn't give us these fields, forests, and mountains as our home, just to lose it to laziness and ignorance.  Remain vigilant and you will be fine,\" Greusim nods and pats your shoulder, \"but I trust you Nolazir, you'll do a fine job in my stead.\"\n\n\nYou bid each other farewell.  Greusim and the rest of the groups ride off towards the mountains, and before leaving the village Rolomag looks back from his horse and nods at you, which you return.\n\n\nThe village stands behind you, more or less going on as it always has, even if it is a little emptier.", "action_results": [{"action": "Branch 1B: Home", "result": "You enter the large hut that could be considered the villages town hall.  There really isn't much to it, mostly a chair and desk near a fire place.  The rest of the space just has piles of extra crates, hide bags, and random farming tools.  As there isn't much use for an orc at a desk, you decide to saddle up and make your rounds through the village.\n\n\nAfter some time, you realize there isn't much going on except for the village seeming a bit emptier.  It isn't as empty as it was when you returned from fighting the Wister Elves, but you shake off this feeling before you go into your old habit of thinking about those days too much.\n\n\nIt is not too long after that several orcs come to seek out your guidance and leadership.  While you have always been able to lead others when it counted, it was never really in a domestic capacity.\n\n\nYou stand outside of the chief's hut, feeling it unnecessary to sit at the desk.  One by one the orcs come through, asking for advice on various issues regarding farming, smithing, and others.  A few even come to you for help in settling disputes among each other. \n\n\nAfter the next few hours, you feel pretty great that you got to help, and that none of the disputes ended in bloodshed, which is quite common in Orcin.  While you are the acting chief, you are confident that no fools are going to try to challenge your leadership.  This would be foolish as Greusim would return to take his rightful place soon anyway.  You have rarely heard of orc cheifs being assassinated, as outright murdering an orc chief does not count, and would only end in execution. \n\n\nAn aspiring orc would have to challenge him, and at the appointed time they would fight where the whole village could watch.  The fight would go until one yielded, or to the death.  From what you remember from when you were much younger, that is how Greusim came to be chief.  Although the chief before him was a terrible and cruel leader.  Since then, you had only seen a few orcs challenge Greusim; those all ended in a grisly demise for the challengers, and saying as most are happy with his leadership, there has been no need to attempt to remove him.\n\n\nAs you prepare to return home for the day, you see one of Greusim's sons, Galik, briskly approaching.  Judging by his demeanor, you know he is upset about something.  At first, you assume it is about Greusim refusing to bring him on the expedition.  Although Galik is of age to participate in these matters, he is way too hot headed, even for a normal orc of youth.\n\n\n\"I'm here to take my rightful place as chieftain,\" Galik says.\n\n\nYou take a moment to stop yourself from laughing.\n\n\n\"Galik, my friend,\" you start, \"do you realize this is temporary?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but as I am his son,\" he says.  \"Why shouldn't I be in charge? I have seen him work enough to know what to do.\"\n\n\n\"I know you would be very skilled in leading the tribe,\" you say, \"but he left me in charge and I will obey his wishes.\"\n\n\n\"Who are you to take this power from us?\" he asks.  \"When we earned-\"\n\n\n\"No, Greusim earned it,\" you say.  \"You should know that status does not follow family lines.  Each lives according to his own merit.\"\n\n\nYou cross your arms and lean against the hut.\n\n\n\"Besides, in a few years when your father is good and ready to retire,\" you say.  \"I'm sure you'll be well prepared to lead us further into prosperity.  Do you think I want this title?\"\n\n\nGalik stops and thinks for a minute.\n\n\n\"Galik, as I said, this is only temporary,\" you say.  \"I would not want to do this for all the years Greusim has, I have my own place in the tribe.  While he can't pass down leadership to you, he can prepare you to earn the role when it is your time.  You'll do a fine job, boy.\"\n\n\nGalik seems calmed down at your words, and he nods.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry Nolazir, my friend,\" he says.  \"Sometimes I get caught up in these things too much.  I especially want to preserve all the hard work my father has put into this village.\"\n\n\n\"And you shall, someday.\"\n\n\nGalik apologizes again before going off to take care of other matters.  You sigh and look around the village, the dying light casting a cold shade upon your home.\n\n\nYou get to your horse and ride back down the trail leading to your house.", "action_results": [{"action": "Later...", "result": "The next morning yields several orcs showing up to your house.  While at first, you thought their intentions were bad, as soon as they saw you they started complaining about issues.  You notice these orcs are the young and impatient sort, who haven't learned that showing up at a chief's house first thing in the morning is frowned upon.\n\n\nSternly, you tell them to wait until you go down to the hut to start village business.  The orcs all grumble and shuffle off, presumably to cause some mischief.\n\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\n\"No damn patience.\"\n\n\nYou take care of your regular work, making sure your wife only really needs to worry about the inside of the house and the children.\n\n\nAfter saying your goodbyes to your family, you walk down to the village center.  Breathing in the fresh morning air, happiness swells inside of you, but soon after you can't help but get a sick feeling in your stomach.  It is almost as if something has reached its hand into your gut and is content with squeezing your organs within.  Ignoring this feeling, you go back to thinking about the day.\n\n\nAll around the village orcs hustle and bustle, going about their daily work and chores.  You see the village blacksmith working hard, mostly making farming equipment for some of the residents.  You have dabbled in some smithing yourself, but as most orc weapons are relatively simple to make, the task is usually up to a handful of orcs.  These days all their work mostly goes to farming equipment, tools, and other metal components for barrels, wagons, and other miscellaneous things.\n\n\nYou watch as a dozen orcs prepare their canoes for some river fishing.  While most orcs can be self-sufficient, most like fish, and it makes good for trading for the villages who cannot get fish so easily. \n\n\nAhead, a wagon slowly rolls into the village, pulled by horses and with several orcs sitting on it.  You recognize them as being from one of the mountain coastal tribes.  They have come a long way to trade with many tribes.  As they trade rocks and materials only found by the sea, including some pearls, they regale the younger orcs with tales of adventures on the sea.  Most likely exaggerating accounts of encounters and battles with large sea monsters.\n\n\nEventually, they roll through the village, their exchanges being over with.  You notice they even recruit a few young and adventurous orcs to join them on their sea adventures.  While you can't stop them, you wish they would stay and help the village.  Most are still concerned about the reports on the Mannate Empire.\n\n\nThe orcs that leave with them will probably return someday, they always do.

We saw a group of goblins heading through the hills.\"\n\n\n\"Goblins live in the area, so what's it to us?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We were only a few miles from the river,\" Ruzmar says.  \"They have always been rivals with the lawless tribes down in the plains in that area.  The thing is, they've never been this far up.\"\n\n\n\"Hmm,\" you cross your hands under your chin, \"perhaps they've been driven up here by the tribeless bands.\"\n\n\n\"Also,\" he says, \"they are pretty heavily armed.

Keeping a vigilant watch, Ruzmar tells you that you have almost reached where he last saw the Goblins.\n\n\nOver the next hill, a large camp extends over the little peaks and valleys in between.  Multiple campfires are alight, and you see the short goblins scampering about, doing random chores or just keeping an eye out.\n\n\nPeering closer, you see that several seem to notice your group.  Before long a group of over thirty goblins cautiously make their way over, stopping at the end of what they believe is throwing distance.  One particularly larger and uglier goblin walks forward.  His face and body are covered in tribal tattoos, and he wears bone necklaces and an amulet which must be a symbol of status.\n\n\n\"I am Gru'zikular,\" he says, \"Chieftain of the proud tribe of Gerobler.\"\n\n\n\"I am Nolazir, humble servant of Chief Greusim, the leader of our tribe.\"\n\n\n\"Has your tribe no name?\"\n\n\n\"Sometimes we are called the River tribe, but Gigalak has never had need to distinguish us.  Only the lawless concern themselves with petty names.\"\n\n\nGru'zikular nods, both hands resting on his staff, which you assume is where he draws his shamanic power.  The orcs and goblins are similar in that respect, they call upon the powers of the Earth for assistance, while the elves use their strange magic.\n\n\n\"That is what we have come to speak about,\" Gru'zikular says.  \"These\u2026.lawless orcs raid and pillage, steal and burn.  We have tried to make peace, we have tried to fight them.  Nothing has worked, so we come to you with a treaty.\"\n\n\n\"I see your plight, the lawless have been trouble,\" you say, \"but they've kept the humans, dwarves, ogres, and even yourselves from treading too far in our lands.  I would say, you goblins and the ogres have probably helped keep the dwarves out as well.\"\n\n\n\"So then why are we treated as such vermin and animals?\" Gru'zikular asks, \"we no longer have lands to call our own, since the dwarves threw us from the mountains and caves, and before that, we walked these very lands you now call yours.  Since our removal we have roamed the land, living much as bandits and raiders in order to survive.\"\n\n\nGru'zikular seems to get a little angry, although he attempts to hide it.\n\n\n\"We seem to have common interests,\" he says, \"so we need your help.  Either tell the lawless to leave us alone or else help us fight them.  In exchange for their souls, and the land they live, we would be glad to put our skills to use for the lawful tribes of orcs.\"\n\n\nThey offer an interesting argument, and although both goblins and the lawless orcs have each been helpful in their own way, they each also pose their own problems. \n\n\n\"I will bring your request to Chief Greusim upon his return,\" you say.  \"Until then, you will have our protection.\"\n\n\nGru'zikular raises his eyebrow.  It is here that you explain you will leave some orcs to watch over the camp, as the lawless would not dare to kill an orc from a proper tribe.

You are almost about to shout at them when you realize these aren't the young and impatient orcs from the other day.\n\n\nYou see three faces before you.  The first being Rolomag, his face drawn and tired looking.  His normally shaved face covered in a dark stubble.  The second is Dekard, the orc who first saw the Imperials and went on the expedition.  Around his head are bandages wrapped around, a dark red stain soaked into it.\n\n\nThe third orc is one you do not know, his hair is wild and his face also covered in stubble.  Multiple scars line his face and arms, his leather and fur clothing not looking like that of your tribe.  Two teeth protrude from his underbite, one of those is chipped.

They exchanged arrows with the archers, and some Imperial knights on horseback made sure none could leave the hill. \n\n\nHe goes on to say that Greusim rode forward to talk to the Imperials, but was struck in the side with an arrow.  While both sides were shooting back and forth, Rolomag is not sure who actually hit the chief.\n\n\nRolomag goes on to explain that the arrow barely had an effect on him, and that, even when all-out combat broke out, Greusim was able to help them.  They killed the knights and managed to wipe out the archer columns after a hard-fought battle. \n\n\nRolomag looks at the ground and seems to stop.\n\n\n\"Well, then what happened?\" you ask.  \"Out with it.\"\n\n\n\"From out of the trees a large force of Imperial soldiers ran out, we fought them well on horseback\u2026 but\u2026 they surrounded Greusim and the orcs nearest to him.\"\n\n\nRolomag seems to struggle with speaking.\n\n\n\"They fought well, but the humans were hard to kill with their silver coats and helmets.
