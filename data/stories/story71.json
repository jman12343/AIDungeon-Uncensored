You do not know how much longer you can survive in this place. No one has brought you any food or water for days. Either you've been abandoned to die or something's happened to the guards to keep them from feeding you. Either way you are well and truly buggered.\n\n\nWith what little strength you have, you pick yourself up and look around your cell. There seems to be no way of escape. The window is barred and even if it wasn\u2019t, your cell is at the very top of a huge, medieval tower, so climbing out would be suicide. The door is far too heavy to break down and you don\u2019t have anything you could use to pick the lock. There is nothing in the room save for yourself, a dirty pile of straw in the corner and a bucket for\u2026 Well, let\u2019s not discuss the bucket.\n\n\nSuddenly though, as your eyes scan the dungeon, you notice something you never saw before.

Eventually you see a light at the end of the passage and find yourself in a room dimly lit by torches that hang from the wall. The room is small with only a spinning wheel and an old rocking chair to decorate it, both of which are coated in cob webs. There is a door on the other side of the room.\n\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, you head towards the door when suddenly you hear the creaking of the rocking chair behind you. For a brief moment you hold your breath and try to reassure yourself that it\u2019s just the breeze rocking the chair, but there is no breeze in the room. Eventually you force yourself to turn around and see the ghostly figure of an old woman sitting in the chair.\n\n\nBefore you can run or scream, the old lady speaks up in a gentle yet eerie voice. \u201cNo need to be afraid of me child.\u201d She tells you as she slowly rocks in her chair, stroking a small, ghostly cat on her lap. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from poor old Nana. I\u2019m just here, pondering the old riddle to myself. Are you good at riddles child? I do hope so. They\u2019re the only way to get out of this tower you see, ever since the old master went mad and cursed the place. Oh and that reminds me, I\u2019m supposed to ask you the riddle aren\u2019t I? Now let\u2019s see if I can remember.\n\n\n \n\nWhat does man love more than life,\n\n\nFear more than death and mortal strife,\n\n\nWhat the poor have and the rich require,\n\n\nAnd what contented men desire,\n\n\nWhat the miser spends and the spendthrift saves,\n\n\nAnd all men carry to their graves?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Answer \"Love\"", "result": "The ghost lets out a sad and disappointed sigh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not dearie.\u201d She tells you as the rocking of her chair gradually comes to a halt. \u201cI am sorry child.

You go on through the door now.\u201d And with that, the rocking chair stops rocking and the ghost of the woman and her cat fade away into nothingness.\n\n\nOpening the door leads you to a staircase. As you descend these stairs you can hear all sorts of strange noises. Scuffling, squeaking, flapping of wings, hooting and howling, you expect to find a collection of animals caged at the bottom of the stairs. Instead you find a circular room with ten doors all the way around, each with a picture of a different animal engraved on the door.\n\n\nThe noises begin to quiet down and the ghost of a dark haired, rather scruffy looking man appears in the centre of the room with a hawk perched on his arm. \u201cSo, you made it past Nana did you? Poor old bat\u2019s been trying to solve that riddle for damn near fifty years now. Well I suppose it\u2019s my turn then. Glad to meet you kid. I\u2019m the games keeper here abouts.

The spiders are the least of your worries though, since standing it the doorway is a great black bear which rises onto its hind legs and lets out the most terrifying roar.

I hear there\u2019s a killer on the loose in the tower.\u201d You want to ask the game keeper more but by the time you turn around both the man and the hawk have already vanished.\n\n\nThe doorway leads to a large dining hall with one great table, decorated with candles and long enough to host a royal banquet. The plates, cutlery and candle sticks are all covered in dust and all the seats are empty save for the last five at the far end, all of which are filled by ghosts.\n\n\nTwo men sit on the left of the table and two women on the right. Judging by their clothing they are all servants of different standing within the tower, but at the head of the table sits a young woman about your own age, just barely into adulthood. Both her fine velvet dress and the refined way she sits show her to be a woman of noble birth.\n\n\n\u201cHave you come to free me from my torment?\u201d The noble woman asks as a ghostly tear runs down her cheek. \u201cMy father sent me here to become the Wizard Lord\u2019s bride, but while I was a guest in his tower, the scoundrel had me poisoned by one of his own servants. I cannot be free until I know who my killer is.

Looks like you got it wrong.

You have solved their riddle and now they can finally move on to the afterlife.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d The ghost of the noblewoman tells you as she begins to fade away. \u201cFinally I can rest in peace. I wish you luck on your next riddle. I hear it can only be solved by one with the sharpest of eyes.\u201d\n\n\nOnce the woman\u2019s ghost has faded from sight you leave the dining hall and descend another spiral staircase until you find yourself in a long passageway that seems to wind in a circle around the tower. All across the walls hang the most incredible works of art. Landscapes and seascapes and portraits of lords and ladies dressed in shimmering silks, all painted with exquisite attention to detail. There is one painting that draws your eye though, a strange pattern made up of purple roses which would look very pretty on a pair of curtains but seems incredibly out of place hanging on the wall with the other paintings.\n\n\n\u201cAh, I zee you are admiring my masterpiece.\u201d A voice speaks from behind you and you turn to see a ghost of a man standing behind you dressed in a brightly coloured tunic, holding a paint palette in one hand and a brush in another. \u201cOh ze hours I slaved avay on zis painting and ze mastery, it iz vasted on blind fools!

Zat von maybe?\u201d\n\n\nWith that, the artist uses his paintbrush to gesture towards a magnificent work of art, depicting a war scene between a group of fully armed knights and a gang of vagabonds hiding in a forest with bows and arrows. Suddenly you feel yourself drawn to this painting and as you walk closer you find that the trees in the background seem to get further and further away while the knights in the foreground become closer and closer until they seem to be right there beside you. In fact, some of them are in front of you. It is then that you turn around in a full circle and realize that you are actually inside the painting.\n\n\n\u201cI see one!\u201d You hear one of the knights cry, and are horrified to find that he is pointing at you. \u201cRebel scum! Men, in the name of the King, I order you to kill that traitor!\u201d At the man\u2019s orders, all the other knights draw their swords in unison and point them at you.\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 Oh bugger.\u201d You mumble to yourself before turning around and running away, screaming like a little girl. You can hear the knights on their horses drawing closer to you, but they never get a chance to run you through, since out of the trees, the rebel\u2019s arrows rain down on the knights and unfortunately one of them hits you right in the chest and pierces your heart.

As you descend the stairs you pass by a window which shows you are almost halfway down the tower now. Keep up the good work and you\u2019ll be free in no time.\n\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs you open a door to reveal another round room. This room has six doors and they are each guarded by a suit of armour holding a different flag. No ghosts appear to give you advice, so you head towards the centre of the room to choose a door. It is then that the suits of armour come to life and bang the ends of their flags on the ground in unison.\n\n\nThe first guard is holding a blue flag with white and red crosses going both from corner to corner and through the centre of the flag. The guard shouts, \u201cNone shall pass!\u201d\n\n\nThe second guard is holding a flag with vertical blue, white and red stripes. He shouts, \u201cPersonne ne peut entrer!\u201d\n\n\nThe third guard is holding a flag with red stripes at the top and bottom, a yellow stripe in the middle and to the left a picture of a shield with a crown on top.

He shouts, \u201cIngen kan passera!\u201d\n\n\nThe sixth guard is holding a flag with vertical green, white and red stripes.

A little girl\u2019s room, painted pink with little purple curtains draped over a little bed and more toys than a princess could ask for. Dollhouses complete with furniture and little tea sets for the dolls, rocking horses, every kind of toy animal you can think of and the most incredibly life like puppets.\n\n\nIn the centre of the room is a table on which sits a little model village. On one side of the village is a little river with an island in the middle. There are three men and a little boat on the island.\n\n\n\u201cHave you come to play with me?\u201d You hear a little voice ask, and you turn around to see a young girl, about five years old, dressed up in a pretty green dress with a crown of flowers in her hair. Apparently the girl fancies herself a bit of a princess. Unlike the rest of the people in this tower though, the girl is not a ghost. Everything about her seems completely real. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to finish this game for ages.\u201d She tells you, standing up on a stool to get a better view of the model village. \u201cMy Daddy gave it to me. He says only a real smart person can figure it out.\u201d The child then turns to you and considers you for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t look very smart.\u201d She says sadly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you play anyway.\u201d\n\n\nBefore you can either agree or object, you suddenly find yourself shrinking down to the size of a little toy soldier. Rather carelessly, the girl picks you up between her thumb and forefinger and drops you on the little model island.\n\n\n\u201cNow listen carefully.\u201d The girl tells you with a rather bossy tone. \u201cThere\u2019s three men on the island. The ugly one is a bad man who threw a lady in the river and drowned her. The angry one is the lady\u2019s brother, and he\u2019s very cross with the bad man for killing her. The scared looking man saw the ugly one drown the lady, he\u2019s very scared because he thinks the bad man is going to kill him too, so that he won\u2019t tell anybody what happened. You are the ferry man and you have to get all three of the men to the village so that they can take the bad man to court, but you can only take one man at a time. You can\u2019t leave the lady\u2019s brother alone with the bad man, or the lady\u2019s brother might get angry and kill him. Also, you can\u2019t leave the bad man alone with the scared man, because if you do then the bad man might kill the scared man so that he can\u2019t tell anyone what happened.

I think I\u2019ll get some rest now. Have fun playing riddles with Daddy!\u201d Instead of taking a nap in the bed though, the girl walks over to the collection of life sized puppets and sits down amongst them. Staring at the puppets for awhile, you realize the girl is so still she\u2019s not even breathing and on closer inspection you find that she is not a child at all, but an unbelievable life like wooden doll. Whoever this mad master of the tower is, he\u2019s made himself his own toy children just to play riddles with him. The man seems creepier by the minute and you do hope your paths don\u2019t cross before you find your way out of here.\n\n\nWell, on to the next room with you! After leaving the doll\u2019s nursery you follow another hallway and descend yet more stairs to arrive in a large room that is practically empty save for a long, red carpet leading to a large and rather fancy looking chair.

This ghost is dressed in blue and green motley complete with a little hat with bells on, which give him away to be the tower\u2019s jester. After some more cartwheels, rolls and assorted acrobatics, the jester takes a seat at the foot of the chair where his master used to sit.\n\n\n\u201cHahaha! I knew you\u2019d be here! Master told me you\u2019d come he did, but he never said you\u2019d be so ugly!\u201d You decide rather quickly to yourself that this is not a particularly funny jester. \u201cHe sent me with a riddle he did!

Much to your frustration though, rather than reciting a riddle as the jester promised, he starts giving you a long list of numbers.\n\n\n\u201c23/8/1/20   8/1/19   1   8/5/1/4,   1   20/1/9/12,   9/19   2/18/15/23/14,   2/21/20   8/1/19   14/15   12/5/7/19.\u201d\n\n\nWell, this is frustrating.

I'm asking you not just because your coffin is the furthest away from Bones, but I figured it would help you out too since your coffin just happens to be next to the most annoying vampire in the world. Also if you switched with me you'd be right next to the new guy and I know you want to keep an eye on him. Personally I don't think you have anything to worry about.

This is the latest entry:\n\n\nIt's been almost a month since I was turned now, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this. I always assumed that when I'd die, I'd just die. I never thought I'd become something else. I suppose it's not all bad though. The vampires that I share this tower with aren't so bad as the stories say. Some of them seem nice enough and some of them are jerks, just like humans really.\n\n\nVlad seems to be the leader. He's the one who turned me, though I have no idea why and to be honest I'm too nervous to talk to him. The other vampires all seem to treat him with a great deal of respect, except maybe for Nyx, who is the single most unbelievably annoying individual I have ever met and drives all the others insane with his manic cackling and unfunny jokes.\n\n\nLestat and Fang are friendly enough. They were brothers when they were alive but it's hard to get to know them as individuals since they're constantly together. They eat together and hunt together and of course their coffins are right next to each other. The only real differences between them is that Lestat is a naturally talented bard and often entertains the others while poor Fang always gets stuck doing all the dirty jobs around here that the others seem to think are beneath them.\n\n\nI'm not too keen on Salem or Bones. I have no idea what I did but Salem's really got it in for me. I suppose it's because I'm the \"new guy\" and he doesn't feel like I'm one of them yet. Bones hasn't really done anything wrong he just looks and acts really creepy, though he seems to spend most of his time following the girls around, so he doesn't bother me all that much.\n\n\nSpeaking of girls, the females in this place are insane! Not Shadow, she's a nice girl and she's been trying to help me feel at home since I got here. I suppose she's quite pretty too, but not like Raven! Where do I start with Raven? In all my life she is the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on, with full red lips and black hair so long that it trails along the floor behind her, but I swear that woman is a cold hearted witch! She seems to consider herself some kind of vampire royalty and looks down on me like I was something on the bottom of her shoe.\n\n\nMidnight just freaks me out. It's not really her fault I suppose but the thing is, Midnight was bitten and turned into a vampire when she was 8, but that was almost 40 years ago now and she has a rather unhealthy interest in men. It's really awkward because I am constantly getting flirted with by a middle aged woman in the body of a child. It's just creepy! Then there's the woman who sleeps opposite me in coffin number 4. Now she is crazy personified! The other vampires are like humans in that they hunt because they're hungry. Mary is more bloodthirsty than a river full of leeches. No one really talks to her because as soon as the sun sets, Bloody Mary goes out on an all night killing spree and doesn't return until just before the sunrise with her fangs dripping blood.
