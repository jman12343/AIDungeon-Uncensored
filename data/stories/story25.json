It\u2019s a damn good thing you\u2019re an excellent hunter. However, lately there\u2019s even been a shortage of game to thwart your efforts.\n\nYou didn\u2019t really want to be working on the farm your whole life in the first place, you wanted to see the world but when dad died, things got a lot harder for the family and you had to take over as \u201cman\u201d of the house and stay put.\n\nSomething is going to have to change.\n\nWhile you\u2019d like nothing more than to go through with your childhood dreams of becoming a traveling bard without any responsibility you don\u2019t have that luxury. Hell, you barely have time to play your lute anymore in the small amount of free time you do have. You doubt if you\u2019d even be good enough to make a living for just yourself doing it.\n\nBut you need to get away, but what can you do that won\u2019t allow you to completely abandon your mom and all your brothers and sisters?\n\nYou suddenly think of the choice that many in your desperate position have thought of many times before.\n\nThe army.\n\nIts not exactly ideal, but you be traveling and seeing the world so to speak. You\u2019d also be making enough money that you could send to your family. Your own living expenses would be provided for by the army.\n\nOf course there\u2019s all that fighting that usually goes along with it that you\u2019re not to keen on. Not that you aren\u2019t a stranger to battle as their have been the occasional bandits or kobold thieves that have attempted to steal from the farm in the past, but you prefer not to fight if possible, especially not up close. The bow has always been your weapon of choice. There\u2019s also the matter of mass combat on a grand scale that usually accompanies army life. A lot different than chasing away some thieves in the chicken coop.\n\nAs you\u2019re thinking about this, you also realize that there is another option. There\u2019s a small mercenary company passing through the area. They\u2019ve been hanging out at the local tavern for a couple days. They don\u2019t seem to be the noblest sort from what you can tell, but fortunately they seem to have kept their revelry confined to the tavern. Who knows how they act away from \u201ccivilization\u201d though.\n\nStill, it\u2019s something to consider. There probably is less attention to discipline and a little more relaxed on rules and regulations. You probably wouldn\u2019t be fighting in some mass land war that governments are fond of waging. Mercenaries travel a lot and tend to make more, however they tend to get hired for a lot weirder jobs, usually ones that the employer doesn\u2019t want people to know about or ones that nobody else seems to be able to handle.", "action_results": [{"action": "Enlist in the army", "result": "Well, as much as you\u2019re going to hate the whole uniform thing, you\u2019d rather there be some sort of guidelines. The mercenaries look like a rough bunch. You get the impression\nyou\u2019d have to be watching your back as much as your enemies if you signed up with them.\n\nYou explain your decision to join the army to the family one night at dinner. Your revelation comes as a shock. Your smaller brothers and sisters don\u2019t want you to go, your\nbrother Mallack really doesn\u2019t want you to leave since he\u2019ll be next in line to take the brunt of the manual labor!\n\nYour mother surprises you as much as you surprised everyone else. You expected her to be the most vocal about you not leaving, but she sees that this would help out the family. She gives her blessing.\n\nBefore you leave the next day with your packed belongings, your whole family comes to say goodbye to you. You almost hesitate to leave, wondering if it would actually be better for you to stay, but your mother urges you on.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Mallack is old enough to take over your responsibilities on the farm. He\u2019s not quite as skilled of a hunter, but he\u2019ll be able to do it. I\u2019ve always known that you\u2019ve had a desire to travel. The army isn\u2019t an ideal life I hope you realize though.\u201d Your mom says.\n\u201cYeah, I know, but I\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, you\u2019re old enough to make your own decisions and live your own life, though I\u2019m glad to see that you still want to help the family as opposed to just leaving in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll start sending money as soon as possible. I\u2019ll also try to write and visit when I can.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2026okay, you best get going. It\u2019s still quite a walk to the capitol.\u201d\n\nYou begin to leave the farm as your family wave goodbye to you in the distance.\n\nSoon you\u2019re on the road to your nation\u2019s capitol. You\u2019ve been to Zal once before a long time ago with your dad when he was trying to sell some kobold eyes to an alchemist there. You remember being overwhelmed with how many people lived there and how big it was. You always did want to go there again one day; you just didn\u2019t think it would be to enlist in the army.\n\nEventually you arrive at Zal. The place is even bigger than the last time you came here. So much has changed and you\u2019re a little overwhelmed. You don\u2019t have any knowledge of the city so you ask the gate guard who is giving a watchful look to everyone coming in and out.\n\n\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d\n\u201dWhadda ya want peasant? I\u2019m busy! Market square is three blocks down as soon as you get inside the gate here!\u201d The guard snaps.\n\u201cNo, I was wondering where I could enlist in the army.\u201d\n\nThe guard seems to change his tone to a somewhat more cordial tone.\n\n\u201cOh I see. Well, as soon as you go through the gate, take a left, and walk two blocks. The recruiting office is on the right hand side across from a general store.\u201d\n\nYou thank him and proceed, but you can\u2019t help overhearing the guard laughing to his buddy as you walk away. You don\u2019t make out all of it, but \u201cDumb fucking hayseed peasant.\u201d was definitely in there.\n\nAt last you arrive at the recruiting office. The man sitting at the desk looks bored at first, but perks up a bit when he sees you.\n\n\u201cWell now, this is a nice break in the monotony. Have a seat.\u201d\n\u201cI want to enlist in the army.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course you do son, why else would you be here? To join the Zalan Empire\u2019s best right? Okay, but before we start I need to ask you some questions just so we can get a feel of where we think you\u2019ll best serve in the Emperor\u2019s glorious army.\u201d\n\u201cUh, okay.\u201d\n\u201cGood, so where are you from son? You certainly don\u2019t look like you\u2019re from the city here. You look like a farmer.\u201d\n\u201cWell I sort of am sir. My family owns a farm a couple miles from the city, I decided to enlist to help my family monetarily. Times are hard on the farm.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, noble of you. Your sense of duty will also serve you well too. Any combat experience?\u201d\n\u201cSome, but nothing major I\u2019m afraid. A few bandits. Kobolds in the chicken coop. That\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry you\u2019ll learn to be a killing machine, but your past experience are more than some we\u2019ve recruited. Any other talents?\u201d\n\u201cBesides farming? Um\u2026I\u2019m a good hunter, I use this bow all the time!\u201d you say and show the recruiter your worn bow.\n\u201cGood. Good. We can always use good marksmen. But you\u2019ll get the chance to use a better bow than that old thing you\u2019ve been carrying around. What\u2019s that other thing on your back?\u201d\n\u201cOh this? Well this is my uh lute.\u201d\n\u201cLute? Ha ha! You a bard or something?\u201d\n\u201cWell not really, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou planning on charming the enemies with your music?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d you say begin to get a little anxious.\n\u201cHah! Settle down son, I\u2019m just messing with you. But I\u2019m afraid whatever your musical hobbies may be you\u2019ll most likely be abandoning them. Can\u2019t be picking your lute while an angry ogre is charging at you or you\u2019re storming a castle. This is the army, not an entertainment company!\u201d\n\nThe recruiter at this point begins to look through some papers and grabs one after looking it over.\n\n\u201cAh. Here it is\u2026you know how to read and write?\u201d\n\u201cYES!\u201d you say indignantly for the first time.\n\u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t get testy. Its just most of you peasant farmer types don\u2019t. Anyway just sign here and we\u2019ll get you started on your basic training.\u201d\n\nYou take the paper, and give it a pointless look over like you actually understand all the legal mumbo jumbo and sign. The recruiter takes the paper from you and then shakes your hand.\n\n\u201cCongratulations son! You\u2019re in the Zalan Army now! The best damn one in this world!\u201d\n\nSomehow he\u2019s more enthusiastic than you are\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "It's boot camp for you!", "result": "6 months pass\u2026\n\nSix months of the most grueling physical training you\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with! However you fared better than some of your fellow cadets. Guess all that farm living paid off.\n\nYou\u2019ve certainly improved what combat skills you had, but your marksmanship has improved greatly. You know that Drill Sergeant Kosser has been paying special attention to your abilities. You\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s a good thing of not.\n\nIn any event you\u2019re being told where your first assignment is going to be. Most of those in your group are being sent to Tulan border. Not the most pleasant assignment. The fighting is getting worse there.\n\nWhat started as a minor border dispute has turned into a series of battles with neither side making too much progress. Even before you joined the military you\u2019d heard stories of the greedy king who runs the Tulan Kingdom. You heard from traveling merchants about how he allows a few demons to walk around in his lands! Utter madness in your opinion. The Zalan Empire might be a little strict on the rules and regulations, but better that than demons letting walking around, in your opinion they should all be killed on sight regardless on whether they\u2019re obeying the \u201claw\u201d or not, they\u2019re evil.\n\nYou sit anxious on your bed in the barracks as name after name gets called off. Finally Kosser calls off your name, and you fully expect to get sent to the Tulan border.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to you in private.\u201d Is what you hear instead.\n\nThis makes you even more nervous. What\u2019s he going to do? Send you on? A mission to assassinate the Tulan King?\n\nAfter everyone else has gotten there assignments you follow Kosser back to his office. He sits down and speaks direct.\n\n\u201cAlright farmboy, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed me watching your marksmanship skills. You\u2019re one of the best ones that have come in here for awhile. You have a natural talent and you\u2019ve only improved it through training. It would be a blessing to have someone like you up at the Tulan border. The gods know we could use anything to help break the stalemate there.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026but?\u201d you ask hoping that there is one.\n\u201cBut\u2026your skills might be better served in a place that has a better mortality rate, yet still needs taking care of.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that sir?\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d Kosser points to a map to a nearby location. It\u2019s the Retlad Kingdom. You can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on there, since as far as you know, you\u2019re Zalan is at peace with them.\n\u201cRetlad? I thought we\u2019re at peace with them?\u201d\n\u201cWe are\u2026in fact rumors are saying we\u2019ll probably incorporate them into the empire in the near future. I dunno how much you know about politics out there on the farm, but Retlad is basically a bankrupt kingdom. Their dumb ass royalty spent a shitload of their treasury on building ships in some vain attempt to find more land mass on this world. Hah! Doesn\u2019t exist! We learned than centuries ago! Anyway now they don\u2019t have enough to pay for a proper military and their kingdom is being overrun by hostile Quillar tribes. They want us to help. Begging us practically and we have, but it\u2019s a pain in the ass. Quillars are fast and as their name suggests shoot multiple sharp quills at their enemies. I\u2019ve seen them go through plate armor.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not good. The Retlad knight orders got decimated within two months of the first invasion wave. We\u2019re taking a better approach. We need to have equally quick troops that can at least match the fire power. We\u2019ve sent a couple of war wizards, but most of them are serving on the Tulan border. Gunpower weapons are a little too slow for this sort of thing, so we\u2019re looking for people good with a bow. Quick enough to at least get a few shots off from a distance and run. Because hit and run tactics are what the Quillars excel at, so you\u2019ll have to do likewise.\u201d\n\nKosser pauses his talking for a moment. You take this opportunity to interject a question.\n\n\u201cAnd this assignment you say has a lower mortality rate?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t sent as many people there yet, but so far we\u2019ve made a little more progress there than at the Tulan border. But of course I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a safe assignment. Those Quillar bastards are vicious and merciless. Up to you farmboy. You\u2019re getting a bonus here. You\u2019re actually getting to choose your assignment. Not many that get out of boot camp get that privilege.\u201d\n\nSome \u201cprivilege\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the Tulan Border", "result": "You don\u2019t like the sound of the Quillars and it doesn\u2019t really sound all that much safer. You decide that at the Tulan border you\u2019ll at least be with a few people you already know from boot camp and you\u2019ll be fighting something less scary. (Or at least human)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the Tulan Border assignment sir.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I\u2019m surprised. Hope your skills come in of some use there. Here\u2019s your first month\u2019s pay, I suggest you live it up here in Zal, for the couple of days you have off before you leave.\u201d\n\nYou take the small bag and look inside. This will certainly help your family. You take a few coins for yourself and then ask if arrangements can be made to have your payment sent to your family from now on. He tells you yes, but asks that surely that you will still want some of it. You agree to just taking 10% of it. You don\u2019t need much.\n\n\u201cSheesh, living bare minimum huh? Don\u2019t you want to eat anything other than military rations every once in awhile?\u201d Kosser questions again.\n\u201cNah. If I need extra food, I\u2019ll just hunt.\u201d\n\u201cYou know there aren\u2019t many luxuries on the border, but when a traveling merchant shows up, you might regret not having enough money. You sure you don\u2019t want more?\u201d\n\u201cNope. I\u2019ll be fine. My family needs that money more than I do.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, family man.\u201d\n\nYou exit the barracks and wander the city a bit. You find it very interesting. You sort of wish you could stay longer to take in more sights. However one thing catches your eye. A small store and in the window is a lute. Looks almost like the one you had before it was taken away from you in basic training. You haven\u2019t gotten a chance to play in six months and you\u2019d really like to\u2026\n\nHey you\u2019re a soldier now, you\u2019ve proven yourself. You figure you can take one personal belonging with you to Tulan as long as you keep them packed properly. You enter the store and with the little money you have you buy the lute. You spend the most of the day and the next practicing it. You didn\u2019t forget as much as you thought. You also finish up writing a letter to your family and give it to a Zalan messenger carrier.\n\nFinally the third day arrives for you to move out. A couple of officers arrive to take all of you. You\u2019re stopped though as you\u2019re picked out.\n\n\u201cHold up you. What\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lute sir.\u201d\n\u201cA lute? What the fuck do you think this is? An acting company? Get rid of that thing, you won\u2019t be needing that where you\u2019re going!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou disobeying me soldier?\u201d\n\u201cNo sir!\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, get rid of it!\u201d\n\nYou sadly get rid of your lute which you never got to play and basically wasted your money on. You don\u2019t know what you were thinking anyway. You\u2019re in the damn army. You\u2019re going to be doing a lot of fighting and all of that, not playing some stupid instrument. You should\u2019ve realized that the first time it was taken away from you in boot camp.\n\nYou\u2019ve made this choice; you need to just put these dreams of being a \u201cmusician\u201d out of your head right now. You weren\u2019t meant to be one, and all those years of deluding yourself in between real work were just fleeting dreams of a teenager. Time to grow up.\n\nWhile you resign yourself to this mindset, you aren\u2019t particularly happy with it. When you get to the Tulan Border you\u2019re even less happy. Your first battle is filled with all the bad stuff that usually accompanies such things. It\u2019s definitely not a fun assignment and your only consolation is that you know your family is getting more financial aid for you doing this.\n\nAfter a few months, you\u2019re absolutely miserable. You don\u2019t have your music to keep your mind off of the conditions and everything is bad here. The fort you\u2019re currently stationed at supplies only the bare minimum of living, no magical back up, the captain is a real asshole and the rest of those you serve with aren\u2019t too much better. Though so many are killed everyday that you never really grow to dislike (or like) anyone that much in that department. More are sent in and more die, it\u2019s like an ongoing cycle, everyone\u2019s so expendable in this ongoing border war that gets worse with each passing month.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even come to your surprise when the day comes that you\u2019re mortally wounded while on patrol. One of the new soldiers tells you to hold on and that he\u2019ll get help, but you know he won\u2019t get any in time and it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\nAs you lay dying, your only regret is that you didn\u2019t get to play music like you always wanted to, and now you never will.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go to the Retlad Kingdom", "result": "You\u2019ve never even heard of Quillars before, but they still sound less dangerous than the Tulan Border, that place is only going to get worse, you know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the Retlad assignment sir.\u201d\n\u201cHm.

A couple of officers arrive to take most of your other fellow cadets. Mostly to the Tulan border, however, it would appear you have a different escort. A young man in loose robe approaches you. He looks like a wizard, but you wonder for how long since he seems about your age.\n\n\u201cHey, are you the one going to the Retlad Kingdom?\u201d he asks\n\u201cYeah, who are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Wessel. And don\u2019t you dare get cute and call me weasel, or I\u2019ll have to blast you with a lightning bolt.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it.\u201d You say which causes Wessel to start laughing.\n\u201cGeez, I was just fucking with you. Don\u2019t be so serious! So you ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess, are you my superior officer?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh no. Look I got our horses waiting outside; we can do all this getting to know you stuff on the way.\u201d\n\nYou and Wessel get on the horses and ride towards your destination. It would appear that you\u2019re the only one from your group to be going, but of course you were the only expert marksman.\n\nWessel begins to tell you more about why he\u2019s with you. In fact he doesn\u2019t really let you do much talking at all. He says he\u2019s a native citizen of the Zalan Empire, but he just graduated from the esteemed magic university in the city state of Nuro. Wessel goes on to and says that when he heard they needed a few wizard over in Retlad, he decided to volunteer to test his skills and get paid while doing it. He explains that the pair of you will be following the orders of a Captain Vhalat.\n\nEveryone knows about Nuro. It\u2019s very famous, and you always wondered what kind of magical wonders existed there, so you\u2019re eager to hear more and he\u2019s all too happy to tell you. Despite Wessel\u2019s primary focus on himself, it sounds like a place you\u2019d want to visit one day.\n\nEventually you arrive at the border and so far the Retlad Kingdom doesn\u2019t look very well kept. The road begins to show evidence of disrepair and the sign posts are broken. You begin to keep your eye out for a possible attack at any second.\n\n\u201cLook! Over there! It\u2019s a village and it\u2019s under attack! Come on!\u201d Wessel yells and rides towards the village in the distance. You try to tell him to wait, but he\u2019s already well on his way, so you ride after him.\n\nYou\u2019ve never seen a Quillar before, but the closer you get to the village, you start seeing humanoid creatures covered in sharp spikes running around at a fast speed which could only be them. They are indeed fearsome looking. You also see a lot of the people running from them, and even a few people dressed in protective gear similar to yours\u2026not that its doing them much good.\n\n\u201cAlright you prickly bastards here\u2019s something for ya!\u201d Wessle shouts riding into the village with one hand raised in the air for a lightning blast attack. He shows no fear. You have no idea if all wizards are like this, but he\u2019s either got to be brave, stupid or just suicidal. Of course he could be all three. Up until now you always thought wizards were supposed to be meek types that didn\u2019t charge into battle and preferred to kill from afar. You guess you were wrong.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay with him to back him up", "result": "This reckless idiot is probably going to get himself killed if you don\u2019t stick by his side. You ride quickly to catch up with him in the village, and draw your bow.\n\nSurprisingly for your first battle, you manage to keep calm and focused on the enemy. Hard to do considering the Quillars aren\u2019t the easiest of foes. They\u2019re quick and they\u2019re firing their quills faster than you\u2019re firing your bow.\n\nThe problem though isn\u2019t the Quillars, its Wessel. He\u2019s having such a \u201cgood time\u201d blasting the Quillars, that he\u2019s causing a lot more collateral damage in the process. During one of these moments, your own horse gets spooked by the incredibly close fireball blast and rears back causing you to fall off of it.\n\nYou\u2019re still shaking the cobwebs when one of the Quillars unleashes more quills and hits you with several of them. You collapse in pain, as the Quillar charges at you. It doesn\u2019t kill you though. Wessel makes sure of that when he throws a bolt of lightning at it.\n\nUnfortunately the Quillar happens to have grabbed you just as its hit by the lightning. Your current pain is increased severely as the electrical current passes through your body, but not for long and your fried body eventually stops its deaths throes.\n\nWessel has a hard time explaining that the other transfer was hit by \u201cfriendly\u201d fire.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Circle around the village", "result": "Just because he\u2019s acting reckless doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to, you\u2019re going to play upon your strengths and keep as far away as you can.\n\nYou ride your horse around the outskirts of the village, readying your bow the whole time. When you can, you fire at the Quillar attackers. As quick as they are, they aren\u2019t really paying attention to you and you manage to get in some good shots. A couple of head shots even.\n\nAt first they don\u2019t realize where the all the arrows are coming from, since Wessel is giving them a hard enough time with the chain lightning. You\u2019re sort of glad you decided to stay on the outskirts. Wessel is having such a \u201cgood time\u201d blasting the Quillars, he\u2019s probably causing a lot more collateral damage in the process.\n\nEventually the Quillars start to retreat. This is when you get into a little more trouble as you happen to be right in the direction of where they\u2019re running! They still look scary and they get even moreso as they get closer. The worst has to be their shrieks. It\u2019s unpleasant to hear to say the least.\n\nYou ride out of the way, but your horse isn\u2019t fast enough and is peppered by quills. You catch a few in the leg yourself and you\u2019re thrown from the horse as it reels in pain, before collapsing.\n\nFeeling the pain you scramble for cover behind a nearby rock. Fortunately the quills don\u2019t penetrate that. Most of them are content on just running away, but one straggler decides to try to get one more kill before leaving. That kill of course happens to be you.\n\nThe Quillar makes its high pitch shriek as it runs towards the rock. You don\u2019t have time to ready your bow before its high jumped over the rock and on the other side of you. You quickly draw your weapon and swing it blindly as you turn around. Luckily your blade catches the side of its head, killing it. At last you collapse from the pain in your leg.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pulling out quills, Wessel and another Zalan soldier come to meet you. Wessel doesn\u2019t look any worse for wear, but the soldier looks very tired and obviously has wounds of his own.\n\n\u201cThere you are, lying down on the job I see.\u201d Wessel mocks.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d the other soldier asks.\n\u201cYeah\u2026Agh. I\u2019ve gotten bitten in the leg by a Kobold before. Feels nearly the same except these quills go in a lot deeper.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you guys came when you did. We were just doing a routine patrol when these quill bastards came out of nowhere! They\u2019re getting bolder and attacking in greater number, we need more reinforcements.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well good luck with that. The Tulan border is the primary concern. Besides I\u2019m here now, I predict that this infestation will be over soon now.\u201d Wessel boasts.\n\n\u201cAny\u2026way. My name\u2019s Tylir. I\u2019d introduce you to the rest of my squad, but they\u2019re all dead now. Even though it was the heat of battle, I couldn\u2019t help notice how well you picked off several of those Quillars with one shot. That was pretty impressive.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cHey! What about me? I\u2019m the one who noticed you getting attacked in the first place! I\u2019m also the one who saved your ass!\u201d Wessel interrupts again, he\u2019s starting to get annoying at this point, but Tylir doesn\u2019t seem bothered by him.\n\n\u201cEveryone did their part. Okay, since I\u2019m here I\u2019ll take you to see Captain Vhalat, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s who you were sent to report to, oh and wizard while your skills may be appreciated here, I\u2019d advise you to cut down on the boasting. Captain Vhalat isn\u2019t fond of it, and to be quite honest the other two wizards we had here were more experienced and they still got killed.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well perhaps they lacked the natural skill that I of course possess.\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Tylir just roll your eyes and get moving.\n\nYou travel through a couple of other villages and it\u2019s pretty depressing. You see stacks of bodies being buried in mass graves while most of other Retlad citizens look thoroughly defeated. A few look in your direction, but don\u2019t look too much, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t really expect you to succeed. Not exactly inspiring.\n\nSoon you arrive in the town of Glaf. It would appear that the Zalan contingency sent here is staying in one of the bigger Retlad towns rather than the capitol. Ryan also says that the Quillar infestation is worse around here too, so the captain suspects that whatever lair they\u2019re crawling out of is nearby and can hopefully located and cleansed.\n\nThe town itself resembles a small Zalan fort rather than a proper Retlad town, as a sturdy wall has been erected around it. The people seem to look a little more hopeful though. Tylir goes on to say that he thinks that the Retlad citizens are actually starting to prefer Zalan presence especially since their on government has been pretty ineffectual about the whole invasion. The Retlad army has only focused on defending the capitol. The Retlad royals appear to find their lives more important than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nEventually you\u2019re brought before Captain Vahlat himself. He looks up from the map he\u2019s inspecting and addresses you and Wessel.\n\n\u201cAh, I see the Empire has seen fit to send me reinforcements\u2026wow, twice as many as I thought I\u2019d get. Private Tylir where\u2019s the rest of your squad?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026dead sir.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. (sigh) So what\u2019s your problem private? Why is your leg wrapped up?\u201d Vahlat asks you.\n\u201cGot into a fight with the Quillars sir.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\nTylir at this point interrupts and tells of what happened. Wessel looks like he wants to expand upon his deeds, but Vahlat\u2019s appearance is a little imposing and he was already warned once, so he keeps his mouth shut. Vahlat soon addresses you again.\n\n\u201cWell it would seem you two have already proven yourselves useful. A lot more useful that what passes for the Retlad army, but of course that isn\u2019t hard. Wizard, I certainly hope you don\u2019t intend to use this place as a chance to show off all the skills you learned in your fancy Nuro college. One of your predecessors did that as well, and as you can see he\u2019s no longer here. As for you, I hope that you can do a better job of keeping out of the way of the quills next time. Most don\u2019t get a second chance. Alright that\u2019s all for now. Our group is being housed for free at the Inn down the street. Free food as well, but don\u2019t go overboard, its being rationed. You want more food or anything else you\u2019ll have to pay like everyone else. I suggest though that you don\u2019t do any heavy carousing. This is a high alert situation and we could be going to battle at anytime. Dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou, Wessel and Tylir all leave at this point. Tylir goes on to show you where the Inn is and a couple of other places, but after today you just want to rest and retire to your room early. You rest your leg and begin practicing your lute. This puts you in better spirits.\n\n6 months pass\u2026\n\nThe Quillar invasion has nearly been eradicated. Most of the major lairs have been located and cleansed and you certainly contributed greatly to this effort. Besides your combat abilities, your tracking skills definitely came in handy a lot.\n\nYou\u2019ve become somewhat recognized among Retlad citizens due to your actions and the lives you\u2019ve saved. The word \u201chero\u201d has been used a few times though you definitely don\u2019t think of yourself as one. In your free time you spoke with the citizens, a lot more than your fellow soldiers though. A few of them even convinced you to play for them when they noticed your lute. It took a little prodding, but eventually you gave in fully expecting to get booed, but to your surprise, you got applauded instead. Your playing didn\u2019t just boost your spirits it seemed. Whenever you could you played a little bit for people in what little free time you had. Never did you think that you\u2019d be playing for any kind of audience, let alone an appreciative one.\n\nIt definitely hasn\u2019t been all sunshine though; you\u2019ve seen a lot of people die. More than you ever wanted to actually. You\u2019d made friends with Tylir shortly after your first meeting and he died only a couple months later. You\u2019ll be glad when every one of these Quillar creatures are all dead though, all they\u2019ve done is cause misery.\n\nYou\u2019ve got them on the run now though. You\u2019re preparing for an attack on another one of their lairs, when Captain Vahlat calls everyone to see him, he doesn\u2019t look enthusiastic about whatever it is he has to tell you.\n\n\u201cAll right I\u2019ll be brief. As much as I hate leaving a mission unfinished, we\u2019re getting pulled out of here effective immediately. Major news is that Nuro has undergone a fucking disaster that needs to be put down like yesterday! All governments friendly to the City State of Nuro that can spare the manpower are to send help. We would be one of those. I hope the Retlad army is just competent enough to finish up what we started in their own country.\u201d\n\nWessel immediately pipes up upon hearing about this revelation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Nuro? What\u2019s going on?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? From what I\u2019ve been told a whole bunch of your kind raised a shitload of undead and unleashed a bunch of hostile demons on the place! The entire city was overrun. Reports are already stating that small packs of demons are running around the nearby countryside. Most likely in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom. Not sure what that means with our border war with them, but I only see it getting bloodier around there. In any case, our job is to head to Nuro, before the undead start following suit. I hope you\u2019re all ready for this, because this is going to be a lot different that fighting Quillars.\u201d\n\nYou look around and see a lot of fear wash over faces and rightly so. Necromancers have a bad history on your world. When you were little you still remember hearing the tales of the Great Lich Lord that existed centuries before you were even born. He almost took over the world. Those stories gave you nightmares as a kid. The possibility of having to face something remotely similar even on much smaller scale doesn\u2019t make you feel too well.", "action_results": [{"action": "Desert the army", "result": "You don\u2019t want to die and you know if you go, you will. You regret that you won\u2019t be able to help your family out financially anymore, but you really don\u2019t want to die.\n\nYou pack up all your stuff in the middle of the night and sneak away from the town your company is stationed in. You figure their orders are urgent enough that your desertion won\u2019t immediately cause a full scale hunt, at least not by them.\n\nThe first order of business is to change your identity as much as you can. And head to a place where you can play for an audience, but the probability of someone ratting you out is low if you\u2019re recognized.\n\nThe question though is where to go. You can\u2019t linger in the Retlad Kingdom too long, in fact you\u2019ll probably have to move around.\n\nYou decide your first stop will be at the Garwold Confederacy. It\u2019s a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. They tend to stay out of wars and they\u2019re also known to appreciate the simpler things in life.\n\nEventually you make a place for yourself there in one of the small villages. You make a living playing at the local tavern there. Most of the patrons sense that you have some sort of past that you\u2019re trying to hide from. But just like you thought, they don\u2019t bring it up or say anything about it and just enjoy your music.\n\nA few months pass and you\u2019re happy. You even meet a pretty Halfling girl to be with, and now you\u2019re even thinking about just settling down here, since nobody\u2019s come looking for you; however there are alarming events occurring in the rest of the world.\n\nThe assault on Nuro was a complete failure. Everyone was killed from your company. It makes you glad you didn\u2019t go, but the fact that there is now an undead city state has everyone worried. It doesn\u2019t help that there was also an outbreak of demons. One particularly nasty one called Velzix has conquered the Tulan Kingdom.\n\nDue to these events a Grand Alliance of nations has been created to stop these threats. The Garwold Confederacy normally stays out of such things, but they have agreed to send a militia as part of the aiding effort.\n\nYou don\u2019t worry too much about it at first, but as a couple more years go on, the war gets worse and more and more Zalan Empire troops are passing through the area. Normally you\u2019d move on, but now you\u2019re married and you can\u2019t bear to abandon yet another one you love. You still haven\u2019t completely forgiven yourself for the first time.\n\nYou attempt to keep a low profile, but one day a Grand Alliance solider passing through, sees you in a tavern and recognizes you. Apparently he\u2019s a citizen of Retlad and remembers you when you were stationed there.\n\n\u201cHEY! I know you! Man, it\u2019s good to see ya! How did you get out of the army? I thought the Zalan Empire had a twenty year requirement plan! You still play that lute really well?\u201d he bellows for all inside to hear. Unfortunately one of the other Grand Alliance members with him is from the Zalan Empire who\u2019s a real stickler for rules and regulations.\n\u201cI know who you are too! You\u2019re wanted for desertion! I\u2019m placing you under arrest!\u201d\n\nYou try to escape, but you don\u2019t get far. You haven\u2019t been keeping up on your physical training since you deserted, and coupled with your Halfling wife\u2019s rich cooking you\u2019re not in great shape anymore. The Zalan soldier on the other hand has been battle hardened in the recent months. He easily catches you and beats you into submission.\n\nYou\u2019re taken back to the Zalan Empire in chains much to the protest of your wife, but its no use, you\u2019re going to trial.\n\nYour family is made aware of your discovery, but none of them come to try to help you. You abandoned them long ago and didn\u2019t even try to contact them; as far as they\u2019re concerned you died years ago. You attempt to explain things in letters to them, but you\u2019re never answered. Eventually you give up.\n\nThe trial is brief and the judgment final. You\u2019re sentenced to death as an example of all those who would attempt to desert their duty during war.\n\nAs you sit in your cell counting the days for your hanging, you find out from sad visits from your wife that things are getting really bad. Dead armies conquering kingdoms, demons running amok. You almost wonder if your execution isn\u2019t a blessing from the horror that seems to be eclipsing the world.\n\nThe day comes when the noose is placed around your neck\u2026\n\n\u201cAny last words?\u201d\n\nYou have none; you just hum a little tune and close your eyes before the trapdoor swings open, and your neck snaps.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay in the army", "result": "Despite your fears, you\u2019ve always had a sense of duty and responsibility, something that probably won\u2019t ever completely go away due to how you grew up. You\u2019re not running away, you did join to help provide for your family after all.\n\nBefore your company packs up and leaves Retlad, you write a quick letter to your family and hand it off to a messenger. Many of the Retlad citizens aren\u2019t too pleased to see you leave, but they don\u2019t really have any say in the matter, just like you don\u2019t. There isn\u2019t much talking on the trip, though, everyone is pretty silent. Wessel however is doing enough for everyone.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this happened! Nuro was a beacon of enlightenment and well prepared for situations like this! I\u2026can\u2019t believe this didn\u2019t occur without some sort of demonic influence. I\u2019ll bet that Mr. Demar had something to do with this! I remember taking his class and he was always a creepy bastard. Before I could graduate I had to take his conjuration 101 class and he didn\u2019t like me because I had made several logical arguments to as why that branch of magic should be outlawed altogether. And it\u2019s obvious by what happened recently that I was right! Nevertheless I did all the required work in the class and I still got a B! Way to fuck up my perfect record! I get the same grade as some bumbling idiot who summoned up a Nurk Beast that he lost control over and bit off someone\u2019s hand! Where is the fucking justice?\u201d\n\nOnce again, Wessel has turned the topic to focus on himself. Happily Captain Vahlat tells him to shut the fuck up.\n\nYou\u2019ll be near Nuro soon and your company makes camp for the night. While all of you are on edge from what will come tomorrow, someone finally says something.\n\n\u201cHey farmboy, play us a song on that thing.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what did you want to hear?\u201d you ask, not expecting to be called to play under these circumstances. In fact it just occurred to you that you\u2019ve never played for anyone in your company! You assume that they all knew that you did, but they just were never interested enough to stick around and listen to you before.\n\n\u201cI dunno, play whatever it was you used to play for the Retlad citizens\u2026it seemed to make them happy.\u201d\n\nYou pull out your lute and take a deep breath and start playing. At first you\u2019re just concentrating on the strings and making sure you don\u2019t mess anything up, but when you look up, you can see that everyone in the camp is listening intently to your music, even Wessel. Tensions seem to have decreased. It\u2019s like a wave of calmness has struck the camp. You never believed your playing could have that much of an effect on people. Eventually the song ends and the Captain tells everyone who isn\u2019t on watch to get some sleep. He then takes you aside.\n\n\u201cHeard your playing\u2026damn shame that you\u2019re here. You really should be doing that instead.\u201d Valhlat remarks.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I know you joined mainly to help support your family.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I just hope I get to see them again.\u201d\n\u201cBah, don\u2019t start talking like that. I\u2019ve seen you with a bow, you pluck that thing even better than that lute. You\u2019ve been in battle before and survived, I see you doing it again.\u201d\n\u201cI sure hope so, its just I dunno\u2026the undead\u2026I\u2019ve heard stories.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, everyone\u2019s heard the stories, but stories tend to be exaggerated. Now I dunno about what happened centuries ago, since I wasn\u2019t there, but I HAVE fought the undead before. One of my first assignments was taking care of some minor undead incursion in a little village. Some asshole stumbled upon an ancient scroll and started reading the goddamn words on it out loud. They look a lot worse than they actually are. Most of the time they\u2019re incredibly slow, and easily dispatched. Its mainly a psychological advantage from all the stories people have told about them that cause this quaking fear in most folks.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose, but what about the necromancers?\u201d\n\u201cFeh, they\u2019re wizards and just like all the rest their arrogance is their undoing. Most of these so-called necromancers are half-assed ones that get killed by their own undead troops. Anyway, get to sleep; you want to be fully alert for tomorrow\u2019s battle. It still won\u2019t be a walk in the park, but it\u2019s not going to be a death sentence.\u201d\n\nYou take the Captain\u2019s words into consideration, but in the back of your mind before you go to sleep, you\u2019re thinking \u201cBut they can\u2019t be that half-assed, they successfully took over Nuro\u2026\u201d\n\nThe next day arrives and you finish your trip to Nuro and that\u2019s when you see the city for the first time. You always wanted to visit it after hearing about it from Wessel, but even from this distance it doesn\u2019t look like anything he described.\n\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026what\u2026\u201d Wessel slowly whispers.\n\nThe stench of death is thick in the air. You see thousands of bodies outside the city gates and they aren\u2019t lying down either. They aren\u2019t advancing either though. There just standing there like\u2026well zombies.\n\nYour company isn\u2019t the only one here though, there are a few others awaiting orders. You see one from the Brot Kingdom and another from the Azi Republic. Thankfully there\u2019s another Zalan one as well to boost your numbers.\n\nThe respective captains acknowledge each other\u2019s presence, a short meeting is made and then the inevitable comes. The attack.\n\nAt first things seem to go well. All ranged troops are ordered to fire upon the enemy who are still just standing there. Arrows pierce zombie brains, gunshots destroy skeleton bones, spells blast at walls and it seems very easy.\n\nThen from the battlements of Nuro a few figures begin casting a few offensive spells of their own. It\u2019s at this point a charge is made towards the city.\n\n\u201cWhen you get in range aim for the fucking wizards! Don\u2019t fear these rotting meat sacks! We\u2019re the fucking Zalan army! We don\u2019t lose!\u201d Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nFine words, but they do little to uplift your impending sense of doom. It doesn\u2019t help that the sky goes completely dark while you\u2019re marching towards a bunch of undead and at the same time hoping you don\u2019t get hit by a wizard\u2019s spell. In the distance you briefly see a cleric from the Azi Republic riding a horse by himself. He appears to be calling upon some sort of holy might from whatever god he worships since a blue protective sphere appears around him. The next moment he\u2019s hit by a black ray that goes straight through the sphere and his life is gone. Not even his god could protect him.\n\nAs you get closer, you see that the undead soldiers still haven\u2019t moved, but there are significantly less of them as they continue to fall from ranged attacks. However, now other undead pop up on the walls of Nuro holding bows of their own.\n\n\u201cSHIELDS!\u201d Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nMore of your side falls and now you\u2019re so close you can smell the death in the air. The undead troops are now finally moving to do battle with your side. You attempt to target the robed figures on the battlements, but of course it\u2019s very difficult in all this chaos and your fear.\n\nYou mostly only get the undead archers. Wessel is a little more successful is downing an enemy wizard.\n\n\u201cHa ha! Don\u2019t you realize I graduated top of my class?!\u201d you hear him shout.\n\nThe gates of Nuro are being broken down and despite the horror you\u2019ve already seen, this battle still seems hopeful.\n\nThen a black cloaked hooded figure sudden appears on the battlements. You see him merely raise his arms briefly and that\u2019s when you get the very real feeling that hope is lost.\n\nGhostly spirits come through the walls of Nuro making worse shrieks than when you fought the Quillars. At least they were living creatures. These drain lives at but a touch and there isn\u2019t enough magic to fight the incorporeal creatures properly. You see the Brot Kingdom\u2019s company break and run, but unfortunately for them and you, your possible retreat has been blocked. All the soldiers on your side that fell have now suddenly been raised, the undead soldiers that were killed have been raised as well. You\u2019re fighting in the front, from behind and in some cases from within. It\u2019s chaos.\n\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m going to die today\u2026\u201d you whisper to yourself.\n\nCaptain Valhlat is knee deep in the dead, but this figure who\u2019s apparently changed the tide of battle hasn\u2019t escaped his attention. He points to the figure and barks orders at the top of his lungs.\n\n\u201cKILL HIM! SHOOT THE FUCKER! DO IT!

Even Wessel\u2019s spell dissipates before it.\n\nNow you see that all hope is lost and you attempt to escape, but the precious few seconds you spent aiming your bow on a fruitless killing attempt has resulted in you being surrounded and overwhelmed.\n\nYou feel the rusty steel of a sword plunge into your side, followed by extreme pain. You turn to strike down the grinning skeleton warrior who\u2019s just limited your life span. You strike a couple more corpses before you\u2019re brought down by an axe to the skull, splitting your head open and causing your brains to leak out uselessly into the now blood soaked battlefield.\n\nYou fall and die, only to rise again as just another zombie drone for the growing undead army.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run away", "result": "There\u2019s undead all around you, fear coursing through your body and all you can think of is escape.

Even Wessel\u2019s spell dissipates before it.\n\nYou ignore your orders, you ignore your fellow soldiers, you ignore the attack on Nuro, and you run and you\u2019re not a bit ashamed to put your survival first.\n\nThe chaos of the fighting is bewildering and you don\u2019t really pay attention to what direction you\u2019re heading, you\u2019re just making a beeline to any destination not completely filled with zombies, ghosts, and skeletons. You look back, only to see more death. The hooded figure on top of the battlements calls down some sort of death cloud that begins to envelop the area you were previously in. The screams of the distant victims are horrible.\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re living a nightmare as you constantly bump into corpses, both moving and unmoving. Defensive chops with your sword do nothing to kill the unnatural creatures and only temporarily push them out of your way. It is only by sheer luck that you get away without getting killed.\n\nYou run further, leaving the carnage behind. You look back again to see if anything is in pursuit, but nothing is to your relief. Still, you\u2019re not comfortable and you continue to distance yourself until you can run no further and you must stop to rest.\n\nIt is at this point, you wonder what you\u2019re going to do. You wonder if going back to report to the nearest Zalan commander would be wise. Will they punish you for running away? The situation was hopeless, surely they couldn\u2019t...could they? And even if they don\u2019t, then what? Send you back in? That\u2019s definitely not appealing given what you\u2019ve seen.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re really regretting your decision to join the army. You wish you could just leave. You want to go home.\n\nGoing AWOL back in Retlad wasn\u2019t really an option; you would\u2019ve been hunted down. But now? You probably would be listed as a casualty. You could theoretically disappear and attempt to live anonymously and do what you wanted to do in the first place. Just travel and play. Your family would even be compensated for your death, but still\u2026you\u2019d hate to put them through the grief of it, if it isn\u2019t true.\n\nBefore you ponder your future options any further, you suddenly feel a pain in your side\u2026you look down and see that you\u2019re bleeding. Apparently you were stabbed and didn\u2019t even realize it due to the adrenaline. You\u2019re feeling the pain now though and you attempt to stop the bleeding as much as you can.\n\nRegardless of what you\u2019re going to do in the future, right now you have to find civilization to at least get fixed up. The problem is that you don\u2019t know where the hell you are. You look around for some possible landmarks, but you\u2019re not seeing anything familiar. Lacking any other ideas, you start walking in the general direction of where you think the Zalan Empire is located.\n\nYou walk for a few hours and the pain is getting worse. You start thinking that you might not get the chance to worry anymore about your potential future, but a farm house in the distance gives you a little hope and you press on.\n\nYou get close to the front porch and that\u2019s when you stop. The front door is broken off its hinges and a few windows are also broken. You also notice a leg lying in the grass near you. Worse, whatever did this is apparently still around judging by the loud voices you\u2019re hearing from inside.\n\n\u201cHa ha! Human women are such squealers! Not as much fun as elven women though!\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2019s real original. Why is everyone always got such a fucking hard on for elven women? Too damn fragile if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cGo fucking rape a troll girl then.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. Easier said than done my unimaginative friend. I tried that once and almost got married.\u201d\n\u201cHAHAHAHA! See I told you this would be more fun than following Velzix\u2026hey you smell that?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did sense the smell of fresh human blood in the air. Do you suppose we missed one?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one way to find out!\u201d\n\nAt this point you start to back away as quickly as you can. You can\u2019t even run due to the pain, but you try your best. Your best isn\u2019t good enough though, as the dwellers of the farmhouse have exited and seen you.\n\nAnd as with everything that\u2019s been fucked up today, the ones that just exited the farmhouse happen to be demons. One is a bigger brutish looking sort, while the other is smaller yet definitely still more muscular than you.\n\n\u201cWell what do we have here? Wounded meat? I say he gets to that rock before you can catch him and pull out his heart.\u201d\n\u201cHah! I\u2019ll take that bet!\u201d\n\nThe bigger one starts to walk towards you, but will undoubtedly quicken his pace soon.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to outrun the demon", "result": "Fear griping your heart, you struggle and push yourself to run as fast as you can in your condition.\n\nSoon something else is gripping your heart.\n\nYou look down at your chest and see your bloody still beating heart outside of where it is normally supposed to be.

I told you I could reach him before he got to the rock!\u201d the demon laughs as he lets his arm slide out of your dead slumping body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stand and fight", "result": "Demons are a lot faster than the undead and you\u2019re wounded, no way are you going to be able to outrun them.

Your weakened state is causing you to have a hard time aiming.\n\n\u201cUh oh, better be careful, looks like this one is going to put up a fight. I\u2019d say by his uniform that he\u2019s a soldier.\u201d\n\u201cHur hur. Good. Hey human, better stop wobbling if you\u2019re going to aim that thing properly.\u201d\n\nYou miss the demon completely.\n\n\u201cHah! You want me to walk slower human?\u201d\n\u201dYou sure you should be playing with him like that? Don\u2019t you remember what happened earlier today?\u201d\n\u201cShut up! I told ya, that bitch musta had some magical powers because\u2026OW!\u201d\n\nYou hit the demon in the chest, but it doesn\u2019t seem much damage. He pulls out the arrow and now begins to quicken his pace. The other demon starts to walk towards you as well.\n\n\u201cSee, I told you to pay attention.\u201d\n\u201cBah! If this is the extent of what his little pig sticker can do, I\u2019m not concerned. Hey human, don\u2019t you know they\u2019re doing great things with gunpower these days? RAAAAGH!\u201d\n\nThe big demon suddenly charges you, and you let your arrow fly. Right in the eye.\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d You whisper.\n\nThe demon bellows, but it doesn\u2019t slow him down. You narrowly dodge his charge. You roll on the ground and shoot two more arrows in his back. He turns around snarling and bellowing for your blood. More arrows fly into the creature, but at last the demon has reached you and smacks you to the ground. Your bow flies from your hand, and while crawling on the ground you try to draw your sword, but a crushing blow hits you on the back. This might\u2019ve caused a lot more damage, but miraculously the lute that\u2019s still in your pack \u201csoftens\u201d the blow. The crunching of wood signifies that it\u2019s broken though.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, that\u2019s a weird noise\u2026what is this? HA HA HA! Hey! You gotta be shittin\u2019 me! A fuckin\u2019 lute? Check this out! He\u2019s carrying a fuckin\u2019 lute! What\u2019s a fucking soldier doin\u2019 with a lute?\u201d the big demon shouts to his acquaintance while he holds up your broken instrument.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk you idiot! LOOK OUT!\u201d his acquaintance shouts, just as you recover long enough to shove your sword straight into the demon\u2019s groin. You push the sword upward in an attempt to do more damage and you succeed. Blood is flying everywhere and the demon howls in pain from the grievous wound. You pull your sword out and then proceed to repeatedly stab the demon until it falls backwards on the ground, dead.\n\nYou\u2019re exhausted; you used all your remaining strength killing the thing. Unfortunately the other demon grabs you by the scruff like a helpless kitten and lifts you up off the ground a few inches. He knocks your sword out of your hand and looks at his fallen comrade.\n\u201cHmm, can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn him. Oh well, more meat for me. This may hurt a lot\u2026\u201d\n\nFully expecting the death that you\u2019ve managed to avoid for so long, you once again evade it when a gunshot rings out and part of the demon\u2019s head splatters in your face. You\u2019re dropped immediately. The demon\u2019s body is still standing though.\n\n\u201cShoot the bastard again!\u201d you hear a gruff voice shout and this time the next shot hits chest and the demon falls.\n\nYou lay motionless on the ground, looking up in the sky when your saviors come up to you. It\u2019s a group of dwarves armed with gun powder weapons.\n\n\u201cBy the gods, get doc out here! We need to fix this man up! Hey lad, you\u2019ll be alright, don\u2019t worry\u2026are you a Zalan soldier?\u201d one of the dwarves asks you.\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026Nuro\u2026lost\u2026all dead\u2026\u201d is all you utter before fall into unconsciousness.\n\nA few days pass before you\u2019re somewhat back to a coherent state. You find yourself in a military outpost and at this point you don\u2019t care. You\u2019re just happy to be alive.\n\nIt would seem that during your escape from Nuro, you ran in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom, the dwarven scouts that found you were from a small neutral kingdom trying its best to stay out of the dispute between Tulan and Zalan, but the new threat of demons running all over the nearby countryside caused them to increase patrols. They fixed you up, but dropped you off at the closest Zalan Fort. The Zalan fort that you\u2019re in right now is called Virtue and it\u2019s on the Tulan border. It seems relatively calm though. Not at all what you thought it would be.\n\nWhen one of the healers comes in to check on you, you begin to ask questions which she tries to answer to get you up to speed.\n\nThe Tulan Kingdom is currently under attack from the demons now. They\u2019ve been assaulting the place and even gaining help from some of the evil populace there. The demon citizens there have reverted back to their \u201cbad behavior\u201d and thrown their lot in with the invaders as well. That doesn\u2019t surprise you. The Tulan Kingdom pulled back some of their military from the borders so the fighting hasn\u2019t been as bad and Zalan\u2019s made a little more progress during this time, but the military minds are being cautious not to over extend. There is extreme concern over the recent demon invasion, not to mention the incident at Nuro. Word has already spread about the unsuccessful siege there.\n\nThe healer also tells you that a few Zalan \u201chigh ups\u201d are eager to speak to you soon, as they want to know what exactly happened at Nuro. You\u2019re somewhat of an important survivor since as far as anyone knows; you were the only one to successfully escape that killing zone. There\u2019s also talk of a \u201cGrand Alliance\u201d being created to counter these new threats.\n\nWhile the healer talks you end up drifting back to sleep wishing you could just escape it all.\n\nOne year passes\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re still at Fort Virtue and it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be leaving the army anytime soon.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have been more wrong on your belief that you\u2019d get executed for cowardice. You got promoted to sergeant instead, which in light of the current situation, is nearly the same thing.\n\nYour promotion came after several Zalan officers spoke to you about Nuro. You even got a medal.\n\nStories and rumors creep around about how against all odds you survived an undead onslaught and fought off a bunch of demons as well. Your past \u201creputation\u201d from your time in Retlad is exaggerated as well. It doesn\u2019t help that the citizens there remember you and are all willing to add to the exaggeration.\n\nAll of these stories have been woven together in such an elaborate way to make you seem like some kind of hero most likely for propaganda purposes. And you know you\u2019re not hero. In fact you try to explain you aren\u2019t a hero to people, but they think you\u2019re just being modest, eventually you give up.\n\nYour assignment at Virtue hasn\u2019t been uneventful. There\u2019s fighting, but now it\u2019s mainly demon commanded enemies rather than Tulan ones. Some demon lord called Velzix killed the royalty there, completely conquered the area and made it his realm. The border war continues under new management except now it\u2019s more than just a border that the enemy is looking to take. Your superior, Captain Eckard reminds you of Valhlat except with a different name. You suppose there is a certain \u201ccookie cutter\u201d that occurs within the Zalan army that causes people to act the same. You\u2019ve briefly wondered if you ever make that rank, you\u2019ll act the same way. You then usually laugh at the very fact that you ever would.\n\nFort Virtue hasn\u2019t suffered a really bad attack yet, and it\u2019s mostly skirmishes, but it\u2019s like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You routinely go on patrols and give orders which you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be good at, but you think back to how you used to order your brothers and sisters around and perhaps you always had a bit a leadership skill, you just didn\u2019t want it.\n\nYou thought that you\u2019d be able to at least visit your family, but of course due to recent events, you\u2019re ordered to stay put. Your family at least is getting more money from your pay increase. They even send a new lute for you after you told them of the unfortunate event that resulted in the destruction of your last one. This gives you a little pleasure in a relatively joyless assignment.\n\nAll in all, you still prefer it compared to being in the unsuccessful assaults on Nuro. The Grand Alliance that was formed hasn\u2019t been too successful as every one has been a slaughter from what you\u2019ve heard. You already went through that once. You don\u2019t relish the idea of going through it again.\n\nOne day while you\u2019re spending your free time practicing a new song, some new soldiers come into the fort. They look like they\u2019ve just seen a vicious battle and are here to restock. One of them sees you and gives you a disapproving look. It\u2019s a woman with striking good looks, but definitely carrying an air of leadership about her. Her rank signifies her as a captain\u2026yep same cookie cutter, just a little prettier.\n\n\u201cYou there! What are you doing playing an instrument? Shouldn\u2019t you be on watch or doing something more constructive with your time soldier? And you\u2019re a sergeant? You should know better!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not on watch duty right now and\u2026\u201d\n\nThe woman doesn\u2019t even let you finish your explanation. Other soldiers that were sitting in your area are now slowly creeping out of the fray. Even her own soldiers are creeping away. They probably know all too well of how she acts.\n\n\u201cSo? You think evil is going to wait around for you to be ready for battle? Where is your superior officer? I can\u2019t believe they would allow such a relaxed attitude around here considering the importance of this fort! If you were serving under me, I\u2019d have you flogged for your lack of discipline!\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Point her in the direction of your captain", "result": "Shrugging your shoulders you point her in the direction of Captain Eckard to which she immediately marches off to. You don\u2019t think anything will come of it though. You do your job and Eckard\u2019s always been alright with you for the most part. At most you\u2019ll get him yelling at you for getting into a conflict with a superior officer.\n\nYour thoughts are wrong however.\n\nWhen the female captain confronts Eckard, she and he end up getting into a greater argument. Apparently they\u2019ve been minor rivals in the past and this \u201clack of discipline\u201d displayed by you just fuels her arguments that he isn\u2019t a fit for commanding a fort.\n\nShe eventually leaves in a huff with her men, but still arguing with Eckard and saying that she\u2019ll see that he\u2019s relieved of his command and replaced with someone more competent.\n\nCaptain Eckard is also now pissed at you for bringing this on him, he takes your lute away, breaks it and tells you that you won\u2019t be playing anymore and if he catches you doing it again he\u2019ll have you whipped.\n\nA few months pass as normal, but then the other boot finally drops. Whatever connections the female Captain had she\u2019s used them, and Captain Eckard is demoted and transferred out of the fort along with some of the others who seemed to be \u201cdisciplinary problems\u201d. Guess who\u2019s name showed up on that list?\n\nYou\u2019re all transferred to areas where the fighting is a lot worse. You are sent to the Nuro front much to your dismay. Once again you\u2019re fighting hordes of undead on a mass scale. Never having fully gotten over your first conflict at Nuro, your nerves and well being in general is always on the verge of breaking with each skirmish and battle. You don\u2019t even have your music to keep you in a calm state of mind anymore either. It\u2019s actually amazing you survive.\n\nYou soon hear about how the Grand Alliance outsted a necromancer called Trelik from the Brot Kingdom. That makes you feel somewhat better, but that hopefulness is soon brought low when you hear about the successful attack on Brot that happens soon afterwards. A Necromancer from Nuro reportedly conquered the entire Kingdom with undead giants.\n\nYour morale is further lowered when you hear that your company is being sent to help the Grand Alliance take it back again.\n\nWhen you actually see the dead monstrosities, your fragile will shatters completely.\n\nWhen the battle commences, you\u2019re just about useless in battle. Your dumb luck also runs out and you\u2019re unable to fight or even retreat your way out of this one. The undead giants might be big, but they\u2019re also faster than what they appear to be.\n\nOne of them charges into your company line which at this point is trying to get out of the way and swings his club striking several. You being among them.\n\nYou eventually land several feet away from the main part of the fighting, broken and bloody. You\u2019re unable to move and just quietly moan in pain until you bleed out and die from your extensive wounds. You\u2019re not even useful for the Necromancer to raise for his ever growing army.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Argue with her", "result": "You\u2019ve served in this army well and always done your job regardless of the shitty situations you\u2019ve been in.

But even soldiers need to rest, if only for a minute.\u201d\n\nThe woman looks very surprised you didn\u2019t comply with her demand to see your superior officer.\n\n\u201c\u2026you DARE speak out of turn like that to me? I\u2019ll see you sent to the Nuro Front for that sort of insubordination! Then we\u2019d see just how battle ready you are! How would you like that?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like it at all. I barely survived the first time.\u201d You say trying not to express any fear.\n\u201c\u2026What? What are you talking about? First time?\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re a little surprised she doesn\u2019t know who you are considering how some of the high ups exaggerated about how you managed to survive. You explain yourself briefly and she doesn\u2019t quite believe you at first, a couple of your troops hiding nearby at least back up your claims before slinking off.\n\n\u201cThat was YOU? What the hell are you doing here? You should be leading from the front not languishing in some fort that barely sees battle!\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t see battle? We suffered a small demon raid last week! We see plenty of battle!\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean is, somebody of your obvious combat and survival skills should be assigned on the front lines where you can do more good. Normally I don\u2019t question Zalan command, but this is really an oversight on their part.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe they know better than the both of us, besides this assignment isn\u2019t a walk in the fairy fields. I think we\u2019ll be suffering a grand scale attack any day now.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it. Velzix has been having a hard time keeping his unruly mob together. If it wasn\u2019t for a lot of the sycophantic Tulan citizens, he\u2019d probably be confined to pure defense, though something will have to be done soon, reports say he\u2019s attempting to gate in more demons everyday. Not to mention that supposedly civilized demons from other nations are starting to display their true colors and flock to his banner. Like I always said the only good demon is a dead one!\u201d\n\nThis causes you to smile a bit and she very faintly smiles back when she sees that you feel the same way. This smile disappears quickly though as she continues her rant.\n\n\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t assigned to the Tulan Border though. I\u2019d rather be taking Nuro back. THAT\u2019S the more dangerous threat. The demons will kill themselves with their own chaotic and violent natures, but the undead\u2026they\u2019ve almost taken over the world before just because of one bastard that lead them. I never thought I\u2019d see a serious threat like this in my lifetime, especially not\u2026\u201d\n\nThe female captain at this point stops. She even looks away from you as if whatever she was going to say was just too much even for her. She seems to be a lot more battle hardened than you and probably ten times braver. You can\u2019t imagine what horror she experienced that would be worse than your own, but you don\u2019t find out since she changes the subject.\n\n\u201c\u2026Bah! Maybe you\u2019re right; a soldier does need to keep their mind occupied on other things every now and then. We aren\u2019t undead after all. So what\u2019s with the lute? You also a bard or something?\u201d she laughs.\n\u201cNo, I think those dreams are long gone, but my playing seems to boost spirits around here a little, which can only be a good thing in this situation.\u201d\n\u201cHm. My mother was elven and she used to sing this song to me and my\u2026brother when we were very young. It was very smooth and calming. Beautiful melody.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, most elven music is like that. When I was assigned in Retlad I learned a few elven songs from a few of the citizens there, you wouldn\u2019t happen to know the song would you?\u201d\n\nShe tells you the name of the song and you know it immediately. One of the first new songs you learned while stationed in Retlad actually. This seems cause her to momentarily revert to a less stand offish behavior. You\u2019re about to play it for her, but then a messenger comes running up handing her a note. She reads it and she\u2019s all business again.\n\n\u201cAlright men! We\u2019re moving out!\u201d she shouts and leaves without saying another word to you. You didn\u2019t even learn her name.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s just as well; you\u2019ll most likely never meet again due to one of you dying on the battlefield. You go back to doing what you were doing.\n\nTwo years pass\u2026\n\nThree years since the Nuro Incident and this struggle still continues.\n\nYou\u2019re still stationed Fort Virtue and you\u2019ve repelled more demon attacks than you would care to count. Velzix has finally gotten his shit together completely. A unified demonic front is in full swing here and its taking its toll. Once again your skills have come in very handy in defense. You are certainly known as a demon slayer, but you still don\u2019t feel like a hero of any kind. You\u2019re just trying to do your job and survive. You save lives when you can, but you know ultimately it\u2019s a futile task as death seems to be everywhere nowadays.\n\nAs bad as it is on the demon front, its nothing compared to what\u2019ve you\u2019ve heard on the undead front. The Necromancer has finally broken out from Nuro, and successfully attacked the Kingdom of Brot. Several undead giants demolished the area. You\u2019ve never even seen a living giant and they sound intimidating. You can\u2019t even imagine an undead one. The power to raise one, let alone several is sort of scary. The Grand Alliance army didn\u2019t get there in time to stop him and as usual they were repelled when they arrived.\n\nYou worry about the Grand Alliance failing to stop the undead horde. You hope it doesn\u2019t get any closer to the Zalan Empire where your family might be in danger.\n\nSometimes you worry so much that you can\u2019t sleep, not that you do much of that nowadays anyway. Normally you play to keep your mind at ease, but tonight you go to the archery range to keep yourself focused.\n\nFor a long time you\u2019re by yourself, but suddenly you feel a creeping suspicion someone is watching you\u2026\n\nYou turn around with your bow and see a pale man. He holds up his hands.\n\n\u201cHey now! Don\u2019t shoot! Sorry for creeping around like that. Professional habit.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWhat? Who are you?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cWarnov. Zalan Intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a spy?\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose you could put it that way. I was here to give some info to your Captain Eckard, and I also wanted to take a look around the fort. Didn\u2019t think anyone would be on the range though. Nice shooting, I know who you are and heard about your marksmanship with a bow. You\u2019re certainly doing your part with the demons around here.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that you\u2019re talking to a spy, you feel the need to vent your feelings.\n\n\u201cYeah, well I hope the Grand Alliance starts doing its part. I mean what the fuck are they doing? Weren\u2019t they created to put a stop to all this shit? I mean am I supposed to worry every day if that undead horde is going to get closer to the Zalan Empire where it can threaten my family?\u201d\n\nWarnov doesn\u2019t look offended by your words, if anything he looks intrigued.\n\n\u201cWell, I can understand why you\u2019re venting. Trust me I sympathize. But as part of intel, I can tell you its not that easy\u2026there were a lot of surprises that weren\u2019t accounted for. We\u2019re doing our best to rectify this situation by gathering as much info as possible. In fact, you could help us\u2026\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me? How?\u201d\n\nWarnov looks around and gets closer before speaking.\n\n\u201cLook, as I said, I know all about you and your skills, why you joined, all of it. I know you don\u2019t much care for some of the propaganda made about some of your exploits. But it\u2019s important to realize that deeds like yours must be blown up a little to give common people hope that ultimately good will win the day. You may not consider yourself a hero of any kind, but your actions aren\u2019t without some of those qualities. You obviously care very much about your family, and I\u2019ve heard how you try to keep the people under your command alive. Sound like heroic qualities to me. Perhaps they\u2019re on a smaller scale, but they\u2019re there. I\u2019m betting that there\u2019s a BIGGER hero in there somewhere, just itching to get out. You think the Grand Alliance isn\u2019t doing a good job? Perhaps we can arrange something for you to be transferred into it, or maybe you\u2019d like to take an even more direct approach.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nWarnov suddenly backs away.\n\n\u201cBefore we go any further. I need to know are you willing to take up the mantle of being a hero. Because if you aren\u2019t, then we have nothing more to discuss. I shall require an answer now.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Decline the offer", "result": "You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit.

You suppose that you\u2019d at least really feel like one if you did that.\n\nHowever, more often than not real heroes don\u2019t live long. You\u2019re wondering what exactly this Mr. Warnov has in mind for you and given his demeanor, his appearance and just your own feelings of uncertainty about him, you decline. You know your limitations even if others don\u2019t see them. So, no you won\u2019t be hunting down some artifact of unlimited power and then single handedly taking out a Demon Lord or Necromancer Lord in their own throne room.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so Mr. Warnov. As I\u2019ve often said, I\u2019m no hero. I\u2019m just doing my job and providing for my family.\u201d\n\nMr. Warnov looks disappointed and sighs, but accepts your decision.\n\n\u201cVery well. This is a shame though. Despite your humble birth you seem to have lots of potential. You could\u2019ve made an excellent addition to our\u2026organization. I\u2019ve also heard your lute playing wasn\u2019t bad either, we don\u2019t have any musically talented types anymore\u2026oh well.\u201d\n\nMr. Warnov leaves rather quickly after his last statement. Something about him seemed very odd and you\u2019re sort of glad you didn\u2019t take his offer. You go back to your target practice for awhile when you suddenly hear an alarm cry out loudly through the fort about a small demon army being sighted over the hill.\n\n\u201cWell back to work\u2026\u201d you say and prepare for battle once again.\n\nTwo years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the Nuro Incident and things have gotten worse.\n\nBoth the Necromancer Lord and Velzix have made progress. Too much. The Grand Alliance hasn\u2019t been able to do anything except fight them to a stalemate. All three sides are looking to gain an advantage and somehow you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be yours.\n\nThe Zalan Empire has become increasingly totalitarian. It\u2019s been increasing its influence over how the Grand Alliance should be run and its strategies. Some of Zalan\u2019s officers have been transferred to become more prominent in leading and commanding the bulk of the Grand Alliance army. You\u2019re not sure if this isn\u2019t a bad idea. Bullying or not, one final voice in matters would probably help the Grand Alliance at this point. There\u2019s been some grumbling by other nations though.\n\nHowever it\u2019s also begun several repressive internal measures to keep itself safe. Your mom has mentioned in letters back to you of seeing routine patrols now near the farm. Talks of seizing private property for the good of the Empire are being discussed. You don\u2019t really like the sound of that, but it\u2019s not really like you can do anything about it. You can only take solace in the fact that being part of the Zalan army will at least result in your family not becoming homeless. They would probably still be able to live and work on the farm\u2026it just wouldn\u2019t be your family\u2019s anymore. There\u2019s also talk of a draft. You don\u2019t like the sound of that either. Your brother Mallack would certainly be conscripted now. You can\u2019t imagine him dealing with the things you\u2019ve had to face. You hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\n\nYour position at Virtue is looking worse and worse each day. Parts of the fort are severely damaged, you\u2019re short on man power and you don\u2019t even have any decent wizards or healers. You\u2019ve attempted to talk to Captain Eckard about withdrawing and falling back to a safer position, but he won\u2019t hear of it. This fort is NOT to be abandoned.\n\nThe only good thing is that there\u2019s apparently been a small contingent of mercenaries severely messing up things for Velzix in his own territory. They must be incredibly brave or completely mad for Zalan gold to perform such a task. You can\u2019t help but think that maybe YOU would be there right along side them, if you\u2019d joined up with that mercenary company years ago. A sobering thought.\n\nTime to go on patrol again. You gather up some soldiers and get ready. You look at all of them and wonder which ones won\u2019t be coming back this time. You look at yourself and wonder if you will. A few years ago, everyone coming back alive was at least a possibility, but now it\u2019s not even certain.\n\nYou go out and change up your routine path again. Always have to be different, can\u2019t become predictable.\n\nA couple of imps attack. Nothing to worry about. Easily dispatched. You know you\u2019ll encounter worse before the day is over though.\n\nA group of Tulan \u201ccitizens\u201d led by their demon overseer attacks you next. Made up of hapless slaves and misguided idiots who think serving the demons is going to pan out in the long run.\n\nFinally you come across something a little more unusual. A small group of dwarves fighting off a large demon ambush. They look ragged, wounded and in dire need of help. So you help them.\n\nYou unleash five arrows into the head of an Eviscerator before two of your number are fried by a hellfire blast from a Flame Child. The fighting doesn\u2019t get any cleaner from there. You see another one of your members getting shredded, before a path is cleared for the dwarves to follow you back to the fort. One of their own chooses to stay behind to give the rest a chance to escape. As all of you run, a large explosion is heard followed by several yelps, howls and screams. The dwarf has blown himself up with whatever explosives the dwarves are fond of making.\n\nFinally you get back to the fort where it\u2019s relatively safe, and all you\u2019re thinking about is how you\u2019ll have to do this all over again tomorrow. You retire to your private room where you play your lute and hope you aren\u2019t disturbed by another attack on the fort. Happily, that doesn\u2019t happen, but you are disturbed by one of the dwarves you rescued earlier instead. He\u2019s come to thank you.\n\n\u201cHey lad, I just want to say thanks to your actions at least a few of us survived from our clan. Such as it is now. Something about you looks very familiar. Normally you humans all look the same but\u2026ah hah! You\u2019re that lad who I saved near that farm five years ago! Looks like you returned the favor! Stagir\u2019s the name.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t realize it either, but then with all the fighting and the chaos you\u2019d barely survived during that particular day, you weren\u2019t really paying attention to faces. You were just glad someone came along when they did.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026small world I guess. So what happened to your clan?\u201d\n\u201cWiped out lad.\u201d Stagir says mournfully. \u201cAt least when you humans were fighting each other you didn\u2019t mess with us, but getting caught between the undead and demons\u2026well it\u2019s a bit different.\u201d\n\u201cThe undead are that far now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAye. They and the demons have been involved in skirmishes here and there. Got no problem with evil fighting evil, but it was just our bad luck that my clan was caught in the middle. The demons are evil incarnate to be sure, but the undead\u2026I dunno. Something worse about them. In the final days, I had to kill clan members who I once called friends and family because of the fucking necromancers raising them from the dead. Some stayed behind to fight since they refused to run. They\u2019d rather die than run from their home. Normally I\u2019d agree, but after seeing that this was a losing battle, some of us decided that it would be better to run. After all we would just be raised again to be used as puppets of the necromancers when we die. Not even free will to choose, or the threat of a demon\u2019s whip. You just become one of them. Can\u2019t let that happen to me. Never.\u201d\n\nYou know something of it, having had to do a little of that five years ago at Nuro, but actually killing undead parodies of family members would be pretty horrific.\n\nStagir attempts to lighten the mood a bit by asking you about what you were playing before he interrupted. When you tell him, he tiches and says something about how elven songs are nothing compared to dwarven ones. You never really thought of dwarves having a musical interest before, but Stagir boasts about how they have quite an extensive musical history.\n\nHe takes the lute from you and shows you a couple of dwarven songs, breaking strings in the process. His insistent singing accompanying the songs isn\u2019t exactly pleasant either. He complains about the human made strings not being strong enough to play the songs properly, but thanks you again for saving his life before leaving.\n\nEvery now and then you play these songs for your new dwarven allies who have taken it upon themselves to strengthen and rebuild the fort the \u201cproper dwarf way\u201d. They seem to appreciate it. You\u2019re a little more careful with the strings and don\u2019t indulge in the singing though. (But unfortunately for the rest of the fort, the dwarves do)\n\nA few months pass and the demon attacks seem to decrease. The strengthened fort certainly helps, but something else is going on. Eventually you\u2019re seeing less and less of them. Eventually some ragged refugees come to the fort and after a bit of babbling and thanking the gods, a few of them explain.\n\nThere are a couple of conflicting stories, but it would seem Velzix is dead! He was killed by something or someone. Consensus seems to be that the mercenary leader died in battle with him though. Without Velzix\u2019s leadership the demons are fighting amongst themselves and the realm is in complete disarray. The Grand Alliance is taking steps to retake the land immediately before the Necromancer Lord gets it. The Zalan Empire in particular is closer though, so naturally YOUR nation is going to get that land first!\n\nWhile things may be looking up somewhat, they aren\u2019t necessarily looking up for you. Captain Eckard has orders to begin an attack immediately. You aren\u2019t looking forward to it mainly because you\u2019ll probably encounter an undead army in the process.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a choice though except for what role you can serve. Thanks to your skills and rank. You can either lead troops as normal, or be part of a scouting party.", "action_results": [{"action": "Choose to lead rank and file", "result": "If its undead you\u2019re going to face you decide you don\u2019t want to get caught fighting them with only a few men to help you. Captain Eckard is a little surprised by your decision, but chooses a few others to be the reconnaissance group.\n\nYour replacements aren\u2019t as good as you might\u2019ve been however. Many times they fuck up and miss a few demon bands that were fleeing from the Tulan Kingdom and ambushing whoever passed by. It\u2019s not too bad at first, but the closer you get to the capital, the more powerful these little groups are. The losses get more severe, but Captain Eckard insists on continuing.\n\nBy the time you get to the capital during most of the citizens there have been so corrupted or beat down by the demons at this point that they\u2019ve either sold their own souls to Hell or gone completely mad. You\u2019re attacked by them and a few of the demon hold outs. Your own ranks have been severely weakened by this point.\n\nIt\u2019s during an ambush that you\u2019re suddenly hit by a fireball from a flame demon who was sitting on top of a nearby rooftop. You run around screaming and trying to put out the flames, but a couple of flying imps throw spears into your back ensuring that you lie still as you finish burning to death.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Choose to scout", "result": "If you\u2019ve learned one thing, numbers doesn\u2019t necessarily imply safety. With all the years of patrolling you\u2019ve done along with your previous actions in Retlad so long ago, you actually feel more comfortable in smaller groups at this point. Your one and only rank and file battle didn\u2019t go well.\n\nYour choice isn\u2019t surprising, if anything more people feel comfortable with you scouting ahead.\n\nAs you journey further into former Tulan territory, you don\u2019t encounter too much resistance. A few demons and crazed followers here and there, but nothing you can\u2019t take care of. It also occurs to you how \u201cplanted\u201d you\u2019ve been for the past five years. While it\u2019s true you did leave the fort a lot, you never ventured far from it. This is first time you\u2019ve actually traveled. Ironic, since one of the reasons why you joined the army was the possibility of traveling to interesting places.\n\nHowever, it seems like you only visit these interesting places after they\u2019re already destroyed. You\u2019re basically seeing the aftermath of the demon occupation. It sort of reminds you of what you\u2019d seen back in Retlad when the Quillars were killing folks except the landscape is in even worse condition. The demons weren\u2019t content on just corrupting their mortal slaves; they were attempting to turn the entire land into their infernal realm. You can only imagine what sort of hell was going on while they were actually here.\n\nYou get to a small town that\u2019s completely wrecked and seemingly deserted. Its night time and normally you\u2019d go back and wait until morning to scout it, but Captain Eckard is insistent on getting to the former Tulan capital as quick as possible. You split up into small groups to scout the town quicker and tell everyone that if they come across anything more then they can handle, to run and alert everyone else.\n\nYou go building to building not really encountering much of anything. Not even survivors. Lots of half eaten dead bodies in various states of torment though. You expect when Velzix was killed the whole realm descended into anarchy pretty quickly and the demons reverted back to their chaotic natures causing as much mayhem as possible without too much repercussion.\n\nYou enter a shop with two of your other team members. You hear a creaking sound, which doesn\u2019t sound good. One of your team members goes a little further in, and it gets louder.\n\n\u201cStep back! The floors is\u2026\u201d you utter and then a large portion of the floor collapses underneath him. You attempt to grab his hand, but fail and the rest of the floor collapses underneath you as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t fall too far, but you definitely feel it. You recover as quick as you can and hear your other subordinate who managed to avoid falling through the floor.\n\n\u201cSarge! Are you alright?\u201d Private Ramusen shouts.\n\u201cYeah, yeah private. I\u2019m just a little bruised.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Gannon? Is he alright?\u201d\n\nYou take your tinder box and make a small light. You look around and see that you must be in the basement of some sort of music shop from all the instruments you see. You didn\u2019t even notice when you first entered the place, it just looked like any other ransacked shop.\n\nUpon further inspection you see a body lying on the floor. It\u2019s Private Gannon and he\u2019s dead. He didn\u2019t land in the \u201cgood way\u201d you did and broke his neck.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d You call up to Ramusen.\n\u201cShit! He\u2019s fuckin\u2019 dead?\u201d\n\u201cYeah private, I just said he was! Now let me get the hell out of here\u2026fuck! The damn stairs are completely destroyed. I can\u2019t climb up, or even attempt a jump. Ramusen, throw down a rope and make sure you really secure it!\u201d\n\nWhile you wait for Ramusen to complete this task, you take a look at some of the instruments. Lots of flutes and other wind instruments that don\u2019t interest you. You grab an old looking mandolin. It\u2019s definitely human design, but it seems very ornate though, must\u2019ve been a specialty piece that wasn\u2019t for sale.\n\nYou pluck at the strings and despite the dirt, grime, and neglect of the instrument; it still manages to produce a fairly pleasing tone. You play for a good five minutes before you realize that Ramusen hasn\u2019t thrown down the rope yet.\n\n\u201cPrivate?\u201d is all you utter, when you hear the slumping of a lifeless body, followed by a low voice.\n\n\u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201d\n\nYou grab your bow, when you see a dark figure loom above you. You fire, but miss due to the figure dodging quicker than anything you\u2019ve ever encountered before. It doesn\u2019t help that this same figure has jumped down the hole beside you before you can blink.\n\nYou\u2019re standing right before the figure now. He has a pale, but familiar face, though the blood around the mouth is new and not encouraging. He knocks the bow out of your hand, but does nothing else to you. You wouldn\u2019t be quick enough to draw your sword given what you\u2019ve seen. In fact right now, all you\u2019re feeling is fear.\n\n\u201cAlmost hit me\u2026you would\u2019ve made a good addition. Maybe you could\u2019ve even\u2026no. Nobody can. This world is lost now and soon my kind won\u2019t even be around to guide your kind to combat the inevitable anymore\u2026\u201d Warnov says.\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you talking about?\u201d you ask unsure what\u2019s going to happen next. Warnov looks as if he could tell you more than you\u2019d ever want to know about lots of things, but instead he just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cNevermind human. Telling you the whole story would not help you anyway. Perhaps it\u2019s best you hadn\u2019t joined us, seeing as I have been marked now. It won\u2019t be long before the rest of my kind are hunted down. He\u2019s really quite pissed at us, and worse, he can sense us you see\u2026(sigh) I can only imagine what he did to poor Count Rostov\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s pissed?\u201d\n\u201cWho do you think human? The Necro\u2026I mean the Great Lich Lord of course. Oh yes. He\u2019s back\u2026and this one isn\u2019t going to lose like the last one did so long ago.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not following all of Warnov\u2019s cryptic speak, but if the last bit he\u2019s said is true, he\u2019s scared the hell out of you more than he has with his actions. Warnov grabs your shoulder and looks into your eyes.\n\n\u201cI do not envy your fate human\u2026the extinction of your species will soon follow my own. My advice to you? Live human! Live while you can, for eventually this whole world will be dead and under his complete control.\u201d\n\nSensing that he\u2019s brought enough doom and gloom to you, he relents and steps back.\n\n\u201cPlay me a song human.\u201d He says catching you off guard.\n\u201c\u2026what did you want to hear?\u201d you ask shakily.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026anything. Play what you were playing before.\u201d\n\nYou slowly pick up the dropped mandolin and begin playing the song that you were playing before and you play as if your life depended on it, though you get the impression that Warnov has no intention on killing you.\n\nHe sits quietly listening in the darkness, after finishing the song; he leaps back up through the hole.\n\n\u201cBeautiful\u2026such talent\u2026such a waste\u2026\u201d\n\nA rope is thrown down and the sounds of feet running off are then heard. You wait a minute and then climb up the rope, taking the mandolin with you. You see private Ramusen lying nearby with his throat ripped out and thoroughly drained of blood.\n\nYou\u2019re also just in time to hear other members of your group coming to your position when you exit the shop.\n\nWhat the hell are you supposed to tell them? Death to the world, reborn lich lords\u2026you start thinking, what\u2019s the point of all this? Maybe Warnov was right, maybe you should LIVE while there\u2019s still time. Granted his information is spotty, but you can\u2019t help but thinking he\u2019s probably more informed on the situation than most people.\n\nYou\u2019ve pondered it several times before, and you\u2019ve even attempted it once, but deserting is looking very desirable again.

You almost want to say yes, but you can\u2019t even if you wanted to. You haven\u2019t wasted it, its just you\u2019ve never really had the chance to do what you\u2019ve ever wanted to do.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026I guess I haven\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\nYour mother takes your hand and speaks to you.\n\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right. Life isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s starting to get a whole lot less fair. I know I\u2019ve mentioned it in letters to you, but the Zalan Empire WILL be taking the farm\u2026and it\u2019s looking like Mallack\u2019s going to be drafted if things are going the way they seem to be.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026see that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! We could all move! I mean of course I have to go into hiding, maybe Mallack could come with me. And the rest of you could use what money you have left and move to Retlad! It\u2019s a nice place. It\u2019s away from most of the fighting, and there aren\u2019t anymore Quillars there!\u201d\n\nYour mother shakes her head.\n\n\u201cYou must be behind in the news, because Retlad is finally going to become part of the Zalan Empire soon, so going there to live wouldn\u2019t make any difference. The Empire can take this farm, but in spirit this will ALWAYS be ours. The Empire has said they will allow us to continue working it and living on the land and even if they didn\u2019t they\u2019d have have to drag us all out and stick our heads on pikes before we\u2019d leave. Your father and his father build this farm up to what it is. Our family is going to be here until the end.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of\u2026what about you Mallack? You\u2019re probably going to be drafted. You aren\u2019t worried about that?\u201d\n\u201cSure I am. But what am I going to do, run? Where? From what you described you practically think the whole world is doomed anyway! I might as well take some of the undead bastards out before I go. I was getting bored of the farm anyway. Let Randi take over! Ha ha!\u201d\n\nYour mother addresses you again.\n\n\u201cSon, you know our family. We\u2019ve always done the right thing, even if it doesn\u2019t coincide with what we want\u2026I think you know what you have to do.\u201d\n\nAnd so you do. So you do.\n\nYou spend one night with your family and make the most of it. You all laugh and joke, trying to put all the problems of the world out of your mind and of course before you leave you play a song for them.\n\nEventually you hug them all goodbye and take your leave. More than a few tears are shed on both sides.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head back to the army", "result": "Now you have to figure out a plan that\u2019s going to prevent you from getting executed. You figure your brother\u2019s plan isn\u2019t exactly a bad one. Your record is good enough that you\u2019d probably be believed. You think up a lie explaining that you were captured by a particularly sadistic vampire who was planning on draining you slowly to keep you as ongoing food. He took you to a cave in the hills where you barely killed him and escaped with your life. You would\u2019ve made your way back sooner, but there were large groups of marauding orc raiders and demons escaping the ruins of the former Tulan kingdom that caused you to be extra cautious and forced you to hide for a few days.\n\nYep, that sounds good. You head out with the plan of meeting up with Captain Eckard\u2019s company which is surely at the Tulan Kingdom now.\n\nEventually you reach the same town you were at when you made your decision to try to leave. You find it occupied right now, it\u2019s not your company, so you\u2019re about to press on, but someone on patrol sees you.\n\n\u201cHALT! Where are you supposed to be soldier?!\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026\u201d you say getting caught off guard. You mentally curse yourself for not being more aware.\n\u201cSpeak up!

We thought they all got killed! The undead reached the Tulan capital first and ambushed them! But why am I telling you? You were there! You must\u2019ve just barely escaped! Don\u2019t worry; you can avenge your friends, we\u2019re gathering strength to attack soon!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t believe this\u2026\n\nThe guard begins speaking to you excitedly and asking you how you escaped. You just continue to say you don\u2019t know, it all became a blur when the ambush occurred and how you attempted to fight, but it was just too much. The guard sympathizes and tells you that you can explain more to his captain. You notice he isn\u2019t wearing Zalan armor, he\u2019s wearing Azi Republic armor. You can only assume that perhaps this is a Grand Alliance company.\n\nYour ideas come true when you do indeed notice several kinds of troop types, though the Zalan Empire soldiers seem to be leading, as the captain is wearing the armor. Your heart sinks when you recognize her and she recognizes you. It was years ago, but you both remember.\n\n\u201c\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d the female captain asks. \u201cLast I heard you were in Captain Eckard\u2019s company. A company that was reported to be wiped out completely. Have you managed to avoid death once again? You are the lucky one aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nSuddenly surrounding soldiers start to recognize you more closely. The Zalan ones especially.\n\n\u201cHoly shit it\u2019s him! You fuckin\u2019 survived not one but TWO overwhelming undead hordes! We gotta take him captain, he\u2019s obviously good luck!\u201d the guard says a little misguidedly.\n\u201cGood luck? If you haven\u2019t noticed, only HE seems to be getting out alive on these things! I\u2019d say he\u2019s bad luck!\u201d someone else says.\n\u201cNonsense! I heard how he\u2019s killed countless demons with his bow! We could use someone like that in our next attack.\u201d another says.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he the guy that plays the lute really well?\u201d\n\nA few people start arguing until the female captain speaks again.\n\n\u201cENOUGH!

Instead she stares at you hard at you and draws her sword.\n\n\u201cOkay Mr. Survivor.

I killed\u2026\u201d you begin to stutter under pressure.\n\u201dYeah, yeah, you killed demons. Big deal. The undead and demons weren\u2019t friends either.

Tell me the entire truth and maybe you\u2019ll avoid the executioner\u2019s axe.\u201d\n\nAt this point you have little choice. You\u2019re too distraught to say anything else. You give a relatively condensed version of what happened. At Nuro and what happened recently. Your encounter with Warnov seems to surprise her quite a bit. You also go on to explain that it was high ranking Zalan officers that insisted on this hero nonsense. She believes you, like she knows something of it.\n\n\u201c(sigh) Yeah there\u2019s a statue of my dad in the Zalan capitol\u2026but I know better\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t question anymore about this quiet outburst from her since you\u2019re still too worried about what\u2019s going to happen to you.\n\n\u201cSo why did you come back? You probably could\u2019ve gotten away with it.\u201d\n\u201cThe same reason why I joined. My family. I guess I just needed a reminder of that first hand. And if there\u2019s any hope of changing the tide of this war with the undead then I need to stand by my decision of joining the Zalan Army and making the world safer for them.\u201d\n\nOnce again the captain seems to soften. She almost looks like she\u2019s going to tear up as well, but she turns away.\n\n\u201cMy family\u2026I\u2026\u201d are all she says before taking a deep breath and turning back towards you, with a serious mindset again.\n\n\u201cAlright, I shall trust your word for now sergeant, but I will be watching you VERY carefully! Consider yourself lucky for evading death once again, perhaps you do have knack for avoiding it. Let us hope that luck rubs off on the rest of us in the upcoming battle. I\u2019m putting you in charge of the Retlad archery platoon. They\u2019ll probably like you. Dismissed.\u201d\n\nBefore you leave she says one last thing.\n\n\u201cAnd sergeant, don\u2019t listen to what that bizarre vampire said. We\u2019re not going to become extinct. We\u2019re going to win and survive a long time. Besides you still have to play that song for me.\u201d\n\nAs you leave you feel a sigh of relief that you won\u2019t be dying just yet, but given that you\u2019re heading into battle soon with the undead, you\u2019re wondering if you just didn\u2019t postpone the inevitable.\n\nTwo years pass\u2026\n\nSeven years since the Nuro Incident changed the world into this living hell.\n\nYour time served in the Grand Alliance has not really changed much. The Grand Alliance and the Zalan Empire are basically one of the same now thanks to the complete embrace of a totalitarian system. Might makes right. Nations like the Azi Republic protested, but there was little that they could, after all Zalan has been practically defending the world by itself for the past few years. You get the impression that if this war is won; the Zalan Empire is going to throw its hat in to be a one world government.\n\nAmazing how power and conspiracy is plotted even when it probably won\u2019t happen. \u201cProbably won\u2019t\u201d because your superiors and political leaders are a lot more \u201coptimistic\u201d about winning than you are, but then they haven\u2019t had to face the horrors you\u2019ve faced.\n\nAnd horrors are a completely accurate word. You\u2019ve gotten over your fear of the undead, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. You\u2019re starting to lose ground. Everyday the living lose someone, the Great Lich Lord gains. It\u2019s a question of numbers and quite frankly your side doesn\u2019t have them.\n\nYou sort of wish your old captain was here. She was a very good leader and inspirational, but then again that\u2019s why she was made a general and sent elsewhere. She asked you to play that song before she left though. Somehow it seemed to make her sadder afterwards.\n\n\u201cCaptain, undead are on the move, they won\u2019t be long now.\u201d One of your messengers says.\n\u201cYes, I can sense it. Here. You head back to my home. You know where it is by now, and give this message to my family. If you get back here and see undead, well get the fuck out and run back to Zalan territory.\u201d\n\nBeing a captain hasn\u2019t really turned you into a copy of the captains you served in the past, but then again you didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d ever be promoted to one. Your reign as one has been a little unorthodox as you\u2019ve applied more guerilla tactics than traditional ones, but given your assignment and your background it makes a hell of a lot more sense.\n\nYou\u2019re currently stationed on what remains of the Garwold Confederacy. It was a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. Now it\u2019s just slowly becoming another massive graveyard and example of genocide.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten to know quite a few of them and you\u2019re always amazed of how they can keep their sense of humor in the face of utter destruction. One of them actually gives you an answer.\n\n\u201cTo keep from crying.\u201d\n\nIndeed. You\u2019ve been playing quite a bit when you\u2019re not battling the undead. (The Garwold citizens enjoy your playing a lot) It\u2019s gotten to the point where you don\u2019t just play anymore to keep your mind off of things, it\u2019s like it transports you to a different world. A better world.\n\nIf only.\n\nYou often wonder how your brother Mallack is doing. He\u2019s been stationed in a relatively safer location back in Zalan territory. You\u2019re guessing that it lowers the odds of having your mom lose both of her sons at the same time. Like it makes it any better if she lost them within any length on time of each other. You wonder if the war is going to go on long enough that by the time Calwin grows up he\u2019ll be drafted as well.\n\nIf he even gets the chance to grow up.\n\nYou can\u2019t think about it now. A massive undead horde is coming and there\u2019s no where left to hide. There will be open battle and you need to stay focused.\n\nYou go through the whole order thing, and making sure your strategy is sound. You wish you had more wizards, but they seem to be in shorter supply these days. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re being targeted deliberately sometimes\u2026actually you don\u2019t think it, you KNOW that they are.\n\nYou see the undead horde approach. You look through some new fangled dwarven invention called an eye piece and see something makes your job a hell of a lot worse.\n\nYou don\u2019t just see the usual undead. You see fully armored Death Knights. Harder to kill than even a zombie giant. You see Blood Specters. Dark crimson spirits that can cause their victims to bleed from every orifice with their shrieks. Both of those are at the head of this horde, and this isn\u2019t even counting that you\u2019re severely outnumbered by just the regular zombies, skeletons, ghosts and the like.", "action_results": [{"action": "Break off into a smaller skirmishing force", "result": "You know that this is most likely a losing battle, but some hope might be gained, if you can somehow draw out the knights and specters and get them by themselves. As powerful as they are, they\u2019re very hard to control even by necromancers and get easily agitated by living creatures.\n\nYou can\u2019t do it alone though. You take your best archers and a couple of your best wizards and mention your plan. You don\u2019t ask for volunteers, you just assign. You\u2019re in charge and you have to make the hard decisions, even if it might mean you\u2019ll die. They don\u2019t look enthused, but you aren\u2019t either.\n\nYou tell everyone else to hold their ground while you and your small platoon ride towards the horde.\n\n\u201cReady those blessed silvers men, and you robe wearers melt those dead tin cans!\u201d\n\nYou get close enough and you unleash as many blessed silver arrows as you can at the Blood Specters. You kill a few. The wizards don\u2019t do quite as well with the knights. However, both attacks are enough.\n\nYou see the Specters and Knights making whatever unearthly noises they do and begin to advance towards you far ahead of the slower yet steady moving horde. It apparent that the necromancer controlling them is attempting to bring them back under control, because they begin to squirm back and forth which gives you some more time to kill a few more during their confusion. Eventually the necromancer must give up total control because they stop squirming and advance upon you once again.\n\nYou ride back as quickly as possible with the Specters and Knights in full pursuit. You didn\u2019t expect those Specters to be so fast. A few of them manage to catch up to some of your men with grisly results. You yourself almost get smacked upside the head by a Death Knight mace. When you get back in range the rest of your awaiting army deals with your pursuers. More blessed arrows fly into the Blood Specters before they can do anymore harm, and eventually the Death Knights are brought down as well.\n\nThere is no time for a reprieve though, as the main horde is now almost upon you. You order a regrouping as best you can, and face the enemy, telling if possible for someone to aim for the necromancer in all of this rotting mess.\n\nBones and limbs from both sides are broken and hacked off. A zombie skull is smashed, splashing maggots, blood and brains all over you and you\u2019re not even thinking about it. You just have a tune in your head to take yourself away from the massacre. Somehow in all of the chaos, you single out the necromancer leading this army, he stands a far piece away from the main fighting, but he\u2019s arrogant enough to be close enough for you to hit him with an arrow.\n\nAnd you have to hit him now. You see a Grand Alliance soldier who just took a fatal blow to the chest begin to rise\u2026\n\nNot many arrows left and not much time, you just load up and shoot, hoping you hit the bastard.\n\nYour shot is straight and true. It strikes the necromancer in the stomach, causing him to fall back, which in turn causes the undead horde to momentarily stop their vicious attacks, giving your side a chance to turn the tide a bit.\n\nThen you shoot another arrow when you see the necromancer attempt to get back up, which turns the tide completely in your favor. Zombies and skeletons fall. Ghouls flee at the loss of leadership and any remaining undead are quickly dispatched. You don\u2019t take chances though. You walk up to the corpse of the necromancer and shoot your last arrow directly into his head and stab him a few times.\n\nYou then start laughing.\n\n\u201cIf this was the Great Lich Lord, I\u2019d be a real hero right now!\u201d\n\nYou quickly sober up from this macabre outburst when you hear shouting from some of your men and you look up.\n\nIt\u2019s another horde. Just as big. You look behind you and see that your own numbers are completely insufficient. The Garwold citizens are either mostly dead or demoralized at this point.\n\nEven when you win\u2026you lose.\n\nHaving no real options, you sound a retreat to fall back to the Zalan border and suggest that the Garwold citizens do likewise as there is nothing more for them here.\n\nThe Garwold Confederacy is now just one more loss for the living. The Zalan Empire won\u2019t be far behind.\n\nThree years pass\u2026\n\nTen years since the Nuro incident and The Grand Alliance is nearly just consisting of the Zalan Empire now, which in turn has had to adapt a siege mentality. There is no \u201cgoing on the offensive\u201d anymore. You\u2019re purely on defense.\n\nYour brother Mallack died two years ago. Transferred to a location with more fighting due to lack of manpower. Like it matters. Didn\u2019t even get to say goodbye. You can only hope he didn\u2019t become one of those things\u2026but you know he probably did.\n\nYou\u2019ve been urging your family to run where it\u2019s safer, but of course they won\u2019t budge. The undead have been penetrating deeper into Zalan territory, you know it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Great Lich Lord decides to stop toying with you and makes his full scale attack.\n\nSure enough it happens. Town after town is taken; you\u2019re pushed back further and further, and you know there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nAn order is given to everyone to fallback to the capital and help defend it from an upcoming attack, but at this point you\u2019re just wondering if the rest of your family is still alive.", "action_results": [{"action": "Report to the captial", "result": "Everything tells you that you should go to your family, but you question if they are even still alive.

It\u2019s certainly possible, even as stubborn as your Mom is, she might\u2019ve taken your advice at least for the sake of the rest of your brother and sisters.\n\nYou mind suddenly goes elsewhere\u2026\n\n\u2026Yeah\u2026they left already. There\u2019s no point in going to your home. It\u2019s been abandoned. They\u2019re probably all safe in Retlad by now. No need to worry. You\u2019ll see them later. Surely this attack on the capitol won\u2019t be that bad. You\u2019ve survived a lot worse. You\u2019ve got orders and you need to follow them, because if there is any chance at stopping this dead plague, this is going to be a crucial battle.

Even a little hopeful. You head off to the capitol with your troops.\n\nWhen you get there, the general attitude is pessimistic. Most people don\u2019t seem to think they\u2019re going to win. You\u2019re getting that vibe even from the generals of the Grand Alliance. You don\u2019t see why. Surely the Great Lich Lord has finally overextended all his resources now. This attack will be a failure and from here you will be able to make a counter attack! Sure it won\u2019t be easy, but it can be done.\n\nPeople are finding your optimism a little weird, especially those that have served under you since they know how that really isn\u2019t your personality. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve changed at all though. You just go about following your orders of making sure your troops are prepared in their defense of the south wall, humming little tunes as happy music fills your head.\n\nA few days pass and you\u2019re visited by your old commanding officer who\u2019s constantly making sure everything is in place. She looks very tired; you tell her she needs to think positive. When she asks if you\u2019re feeling alright, you just laugh and ask if she\u2019d like to hear a song.\n\nShe tells you no with a grim look. She also tells you point blank that she wants to get laid one last time before this battle. Being in the somewhat scattered mind frame that you\u2019re in right now, you ask who the candidate is.\n\nA couple hours later, you have your answer. Before you leave her room, she asks you to play a song for her after all. It\u2019s the one she asked to play before. The one her mother sang to her.\n\nAs you play she noticeably begins to weep. She doesn\u2019t attempt to hide it.

An attempt is made to kill the Great Lich Lord, but he merely gets back up from the hail of gunfire and arrows that strike him.\n\nSoon the gates are compromised. You order your troops to take to the streets and fight off the invading hordes with the rest of the soldiers. You do likewise, though now you\u2019re really wondering about a way to try to escape. Its no use though, the dead are everywhere butchering anything alive.

Got stabbed by one those corpses. We can\u2019t move her. Help\u2019s gotta come soon\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNO, it won\u2019t Randi! The capitol of Zalan is being attacked as we speak! I came home to get your guys! This is the fucking end! We\u2019ve lost! We just gotta\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re interrupted when you have to cut down an advancing zombie. Your sister fires a shot at another one. Suddenly a scream from the house is heard, followed by another. That has to be Calwin, and Makana. Randi rushes from the window and you cut down another zombie before bashing the door down with relative ease.\n\nMore screaming is heard along with growling this time. You look around and run down the hallway where Randi is standing motionless. She\u2019s dropped her pistol.\n\nYou push her aside and see your other sister Makana dead on the floor and then a quick scan to the left and you see your mother eating Calwin.\n\nShe\u2019s one of those things\u2026\n\nYou act where Randi failed and give a killing blow to the thing that was once your mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You whisper and her blood splashes across your face.\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to get the hell out of the house, but Randi is still standing there motionless.\n\n\u201cCOME ON! WE GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cYeah...okay\u2026\u201d Randi says and begins to move like she\u2019s in slow motion and picks up her flintlock.\n\nYou run past Randi in the hallway who\u2019s still moving slowly.\n\n\u201cRandi get your ass mov\u2026\u201d\n\nYou hear a gunshot behind you. Followed by the slumping of a lifeless body. You don\u2019t even turn around, you don\u2019t want to see.\n\nWhen you get outside, surprisingly the undead haven\u2019t become unmanageable yet, and you cut down another couple with relative ease. Your horse unfortunately has run off, you\u2019re on foot from here.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know where to go. Where is it going to be safe? Nowhere, but you lack any other ideas, so you just head for unclaimed wilderness.\n\nAfter about a day of running, hiding and maneuvering, you\u2019re in a relatively safe location and that\u2019s when you finally allow yourself to grieve for the loss of your family. You weep.\n\nYou\u2019ve lost everything now. Everything you did was basically for them, and now they\u2019re all gone. You don\u2019t know if you can even continue. What would be the point? The world seems to be doomed anyway.\n\nBut then after you think about it, you decide that if death is taking over the world, you\u2019re not going to make it easy. Death has already taken everything away from you except your life, and you\u2019re going to hold on to that as long as possible. You\u2019re going to live for your family and all the others that can\u2019t any longer.\n\nYou\u2019re going to survive, because ultimately that\u2019s what you\u2019ve always done. You\u2019ve cheated death more than once already and you\u2019ll continue to do it. Death itself is going to have to hunt you down if it wants your life.\n\nAfter reaching this conclusion, you try to think of where you should go next. Going to any type of centers of civilization is out of the question now. You\u2019d only have to move again, them being targets now.\n\nSo it\u2019s the life of wanderer now. The question is where would be best? The forests aren\u2019t exactly safe, but you\u2019re more familiar with surviving in them. The mountains might be a little safer, but living in them is going to be a lot harsher.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stick to the forests", "result": "Running from the undead, only to die of starvation and the cold in the mountains isn\u2019t your idea of survival. You\u2019re sticking to familiar terrain. You travel further away from civilization and ultimately deeper into a large forest. You\u2019re not exactly sure of where you\u2019re at, but you know you\u2019ve left the Zalan borders. You\u2019re probably in the unclaimed area north of the Retlad province. You never patrolled that far when you were stationed there, so you\u2019re unsure of what to expect. You\u2019ll certainly have to be alert though.\n\nA few weeks pass and you\u2019ve got the hang of it. A few close calls with an Eberaw Hunter, but you\u2019ve managed to make somewhat of a home for yourself. You mainly sleep in the trees. You get water from springs and small streams and as for food, well you always were good at hunting.\n\nYou pass the time playing your mandolin and just basically keeping watch. As the days pass by though, you get the impression that someone is watching YOU.\n\nIt\u2019s not any undead though. You haven\u2019t seen any in weeks. You haven\u2019t come across any living creatures of higher intelligence either, but then again that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t around\u2026\n\n\u201cHello stranger. Do you like our forest?\u201d you hear a small voice say.\n\nYou look around, but see nothing. You guess who ever it is, is invisible, and you nearly go for your weapon.\n\n\u201cPlease, no need for that. You are among friends here, musical one.\u201d The voice says and then you see your unseen host appears before you. She\u2019s very small and probably only comes up to ankle. You\u2019ve heard of fairies before, but you\u2019ve never seen one.\n\n\u201cAre you a fairy?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe go by many different names. Technically I am a pixie, but if you prefer, fairy will do. We heard you playing over the weeks and I thought it was about time we told you our appreciation for it. We didn\u2019t know you big people had gifts for it. You are human are you not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and thanks.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what brings you out here? Are you a ranger perhaps? You seem to have skills about you that are useful in this environment.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not a ranger. Just trying to escape death like everyone else I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, you realize as beautiful as this forest is, it\u2019s not without its dangers. Death is here as well, but I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but its at least reasonable. There aren\u2019t zombies and wraiths terrorizing the place\u2026well at least not yet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about stranger?\u201d the pixie asks quizzically, you look a little surprised yourself.\n\n\u201cThe Great Lich Lord of course. He\u2019s destroying everything, and I dunno how he\u2019s going to be stopped. I don\u2019t think he can.\u201d\n\nYour words immediately make the pixie\u2019s cheerful demeanor change immediately.\n\n\u201c\u2026he\u2019s returned?! But he was killed centuries ago! My clan has told the stories for generations!\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s back, or someone like him\u2026you really didn\u2019t know? I mean this war with him has been going on for years now. Ten to be precise. Don\u2019t you leave this forest?\u201d\n\u201cYou must understand stranger, we have everything we want here. There is no need to leave. We also live in illusions, what you see now, is not necessarily what is. We remain hidden in our illusions so nobody may ever harm us and we can live our lives in relative isolation. It is only on rare occasions that we reveal ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve heard stories about your kind being elsewhere or even in cities.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell we are not the only fairy folk you know! Perhaps the others you heard of were sprites, or brownies or even a different clan of pixies. I can only speak for my clan and as far as I know we are the only fairy folk that live in this particular forest. There are other denizens of course, but thanks to our illusions we stay safely hidden. Even the occasional human or goblinoid that has wandered in here has not disturbed us. Quite frankly, you\u2019d be the first person in centuries that we\u2019ve revealed ourselves to.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any elves in this forest?\u201d you ask, sort of figuring that some might have retreated or made a home here, forests being their natural homes and all. Your question is met with slight annoyance.\n\n\u201cMost certainly not! This place has been elf free for millennia and hopefully stays that way! I\u2019ll speak no more of this elven nonsense!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t press the issue, but up until now you figured fairy folk and elves were all friends, guess not. The pixie changes the subject since she wants to know more about this Great Lich Lord business and says her name is Qweet. Qweet tells you that she will return with the rest of her clan, as she will not reveal their home of course. In a somewhat playful yet firm tone she also warns you not to try to follow her, though as good of a tracker you are you doubt if you could anyway since she turns invisible again.\n\nWhile you wait, you still can\u2019t believe she and the rest of her clan don\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s going on; you almost envy them for living in blissful ignorance for the last ten years. You also feel like you\u2019ve ruined things for them.\n\nEventually more pixies return and you tell them what\u2019s been going on. They are saddened, but maintain a confident demeanor. They are certain that they will survive this plague due to their illusions. They explain that if need be they can hide the entire forest, which with the new grim information you gave them they are very inclined to do. They still have to discuss it.\n\nIn the meantime they say they hope you\u2019ll stick around for awhile as they still enjoy your playing and you aren\u2019t destroying the forest. You\u2019re just glad you\u2019ve met some friendly people that aren\u2019t trying to kill you. It\u2019s a nice change and after what you\u2019ve been through recently, you welcome it.\n\nOne year passes\u2026\n\nYour time in the pixie forest has been relatively safe. Other than the occasional aggressive forest beasts, you haven\u2019t had to do much combat. It\u2019s been a relief. You\u2019ve enjoyed the company of the pixies as well.\n\nHowever, your natural curiosity has gotten the better of you on occasion and you have made a few trips outside of the forest.\n\nYou travel as far as the Retlad province and the first obscure village you stumble across is completely decimated, with undead roaming around. The scary part about it is this is very recent looking, which means they\u2019re starting to head your way.\n\nIt\u2019ll start with the occasional zombie or skeleton wandering in. Then more will come. How long before an army arrives? Again due to your information, Qweet and the rest of her clan have made the final decision to hide their forest entirely. They tell you that they would like you to stay. You would even be allowed to see their true home. The only stipulation is that you would not be able to leave. The illusion wouldn\u2019t just hide the forest, but it would create a barrier preventing entry or exit. You can\u2019t imagine how it would look to those on the outside of the forest.\n\nAppealing to be sure, but as much as you like the company of the pixies, you don\u2019t think it will be safe to dwell in their forest for too much longer, illusions or not. The Gnomes back in the Garwold Confederacy had some excellent illusionists as well, and it didn\u2019t help them.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay in the forest", "result": "This is probably the most satisfied you\u2019ve been in a long time. Why bother running anymore? You\u2019re not going to be any happier elsewhere as you eek out an existence. This is a place where you can play your music and have a regular appreciative audience. Perhaps the pixie illusion will fail, perhaps it won\u2019t, but this is your home now.\n\n\u201cQueet, I\u2019m staying.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d she squeaks.\n\nThe pixies go through with their plan of hiding the entire forest. They explain that for everyone else it will look like a rock mass and the magic shield will prevent entry in case someone bumps into the \u201crock\u201d. Creatures inside will only see more forest outside the barrier and will probably be baffled to as why they can\u2019t go any further, but will probably not make any serious attempt to do so even if they could.\n\nThe pixies also allow you to enter their little village. Naturally you\u2019re much bigger, but a special arrangement is made so that you can stay nearby and they build you a tree-house of sorts and provide meals and drink for you.\n\nLife with the pixies full time is relatively nice. Of course a few are prone to play jokes on you sometimes, you don\u2019t get mad about it and they usually make up for it later. A few years pass and it gets to the point where you almost forget about what\u2019s going on outside the forest since almost everyday is a pixie party filled with merriment and music. There\u2019s one particular time when there was a brief magical disturbance in the illusion, but the pixies managed to correct it. It does cause you to get concerned, but the pixies still insist that you not worry.\n\nAfter fifteen some odd years pass, the forest begins to signs of unnatural decay, and forest creatures seem to be dying way before their time.\n\nSome of the pixies have made comments of not feeling themselves, which is very odd since being fairy creatures they don\u2019t normally get sick. You haven\u2019t been feeling up to your usual standards either. You at first chalked it up to age, but you know that it\u2019s more than that. The Great Lich Lord\u2019s influence has finally penetrated the illusion. Death is creeping in.\n\nThe months pass and the illusion begins to break down despite attempts to keep it up. At last for the first time in years you see the \u201coutside world\u201d again. It\u2019s desolate and bleak. The Great Lich Lord has been thorough in his conquest of the world and with this new found green patch, it won\u2019t be long before it becomes as dead as the rest of the landscape.\n\nPerhaps because they\u2019re magical creatures of nature, the pixies cannot withstand this death aura as well as you can, and they begin dying. Their illusions and happy lush world utterly destroyed.\n\n\u201cWh\u2026why is this happening?\u201d are Queet\u2019s last delirious words before she expires.\n\nOne by one they all die. You weep as you can do nothing for them. Nobody can. Once again you\u2019ve lost another family. You wish you\u2019d left the damn forest long ago just so you hadn\u2019t deluded yourself and gotten so attached to the pixies only to watch them die.\n\nHowever, you decide that this place will be your last stand as well and you\u2019re too tired to run even if there was anywhere safe to run to anyway. You fight off undead creatures for a couple months as you attempt to survive in this now dying forest, but ultimately you\u2019re overwhelmed and killed.\n\nSadly, unlike your pixie friends, you are not allowed to rest in peace as you wander the landscape in search of the last remnants of life to destroy in the Great Lich Lord\u2019s service.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave", "result": "The pixies have almost made you forget about what\u2019s really going on in the rest of the world\u2026but you still know it\u2019s going on. Perhaps it\u2019s easier for them, as they have not had to experience the tragedies you\u2019ve faced, but you know the destruction that\u2019s eventually going to come. You don\u2019t see any hope in their plan and if you stayed, and you still would never be able to completely relax. You could possibly be trapped as well.\n\nHowever, you have no wish to bring more despair to these people. Let them live in illusions for as long as they can,\n\nYou wish you could.\n\nIt is with great regret that you tell them that you cannot stay. They attempt to convince you to do otherwise, but you\u2019ve already made up your mind. Finally they accept your decision, but insist on repaying you for all your musical entertainment. They give you a small magical amulet. They tell you it can make you invisible for short periods of time.\n\nYou thank them and assure them that it will most definitely come in handy.\n\nYou leave the forest and head further away from the undead plague.\n\nNine years pass\u2026\n\nTwenty years of surviving this living hell.\n\nLiving in a cave in the mountains isn\u2019t as easy as it was in the Pixie forest, but it\u2019s probably a lot safer as far as undead are concerned. The biggest threats you\u2019ve had to face are a few Cragmaws and Mountain Trolls. Once you ran into a couple of dwarves, so you assume that there may be an underground settlement somewhere in the area. You attempted to speak, but they just shot at you with their crossbows and told you to go away, saying that humans were the cause of the problem going on right now.\n\nYour use your amulet when you can as it seems that the living have been just as willing to kill you as the undead. Then again, that\u2019s nothing new.\n\nEvery now and then you travel and scout around the area taking in the untainted countryside. You figure you should do it now before it\u2019s claimed eventually. The living exist here, which means death can only eventually follow. You just wonder how long it will take.\n\nSometimes you walk along the shore that\u2019s nearby. You look out past the vast blue and begin to wonder if there are any other places out there. You briefly entertain the idea of building a boat. You know that the globe was thoroughly charted centuries ago and that this is the only continent, but still you wonder if something wasn\u2019t missed. Of course you\u2019re probably just holding on to the false hope that you could theoretically go someplace else where death wasn\u2019t everywhere.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t such a place.\n\nLately something very odd has been happening and you have no idea what it is. You could swear that the landscape has been subtlety altering itself from time to time. Not permanently, but it seems to look \u201cwavy\u201d or \u201cwarped\u201d briefly.\n\nYou initially chalk it up to your prolonged isolation and seeing things because of it, however you soon find out that it\u2019s more than just your mind playing tricks on you.\n\nOne day after you\u2019ve done some hunting and bringing your catch back to your cave, you start noticing a severe slow down in your actions.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d you say to yourself, except it comes out a lot slower. You don\u2019t experience for long, but the worst is yet to come.\n\nA portal opens up in the sky and you immediately feel ill. You see a creature that you\u2019ve never seen before and it\u2019s huge but it feels incredibly unnatural and it definitely isn\u2019t of this world. The dead animal that you\u2019re carrying suddenly melts into a black goo like substance. You jump back and nearly fall off the side of the mountain, which now feels like jelly under your feet rather than sturdy rock.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going here and you don\u2019t want to know. All you know is reality is starting to be seriously warped and you\u2019re ready to puke.\n\nThe tentacled creature doesn\u2019t seem to notice you, it\u2019s just surveying and floating in the air as the area around and beneath it changes. That still doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t attack eventually when it does notice you.\n\nYou immediately attempt to use your amulet, but nothing is happening. The creature or something else is nullifying your magic item.\n\nRight now you\u2019re caught out in the open, your cave is close, but you\u2019re still not sure if you can get there in time and even if you do, would you be any safer? The other alternative is to make you way back down the mountain and try to escape that way.

You can still hear weird noises coming from outside and you\u2019re desperate to drown them out as you feel like its doing something to your mind. In fact, you\u2019re feeling a little deranged.\n\n\u201cWHAT?! WHAT?! UNDEAD WEREN\u2019T ENOUGH?! NOW THIS?! HAHAHAHA! YOU CAN\u2019T KILL ME! I\u2019LL SURVIVE! I SURVIVE EVERYTHING!

You grab your sword and start hacking away, only to fall to the ground half laughing and half crying.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2026I\u2019ve lost it all\u2026(sob) why? WHERE ARE THE GODS? WHY HAVEN\u2019T YOU STOPPED THIS?! DAMN YOU FUCKING ALL! Ha ha ha ha!\u201d\n\nYou look into the small fire that lights your cave and see it change into a blue color. You begin to think you see faces in it.\n\n\u201cRandi? Is that you? I\u2019m sorry\u2026I could still save\u2026\u201d\n\nYou burn your hand badly when you shove it into the flames in some misguided attempt to save your sister who is not there. It\u2019s at this point; you realize you\u2019re losing your mind. You didn\u2019t survive this long just to lose that. You start trying to block out the sounds, but it\u2019s relentless.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you see your mandolin on the floor nearby. Music. It always takes you to another place. A better place. You can\u2019t play it right now with your burned hand, but your music is always with you. In your mind.\n\nYou begin to focus on one particular song in your head. You close your eyes think of yourself playing. The tune is nearly drowned out by the noise, but eventually the music gets louder and the creature\u2019s noise is getting quieter, until finally that\u2019s all you can hear.\n\nYou have no idea how long you do this for, but eventually you open your eyes again, and everything is normal. The walls are rock, the fire is red. Your hand still hurts, but it will heal.\n\nYou stay in the cave for days, unsure of what to make of all this. Ultimately you leave to explore cautiously, and everything outside seems normal as well. There is no sign that the creature was ever around. You don\u2019t know if it moved on, disappeared, or what.\n\nDid you go temporarily insane? Did all of this really happen? You do know you burned your hand, so you\u2019re pretty sure it did on some level. In any event, you never want to encounter anything like that ever again. Death almost seems preferable than complete madness.\n\nYou\u2019re still shaken up by the experience for months to come but eventually you get over it. Just like you have with every other hardship you\u2019ve faced.\n\nTwenty years pass\u2026\n\nForty years have passed and you feel death closer than ever. Old age has been taking its toll and while you\u2019re somewhat fit for your age you can\u2019t stop the ravages of time.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not just that. It\u2019s the world in general. The place has slowly become a dead world, quite literally from what you\u2019ve seen during your travels.\n\nEventually you abandoned your cave in the mountain when the dead began to congregate in the area. The dwarven settlement was probably attacked. You don\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t stick around. You continued to stay on the move.\n\nAfter a few years of wandering, you noticed dead trees. Not unusual in the lands of the Great Lich Lord, but you were sticking to places at least on the outskirts of his domain. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter. His influence was obviously extending. The magic in your amulet no longer works, and you briefly thought of the pixies. You know they didn\u2019t survive.\n\nSoon grass was no longer growing. Hunting was becoming scarce. Animals were dying out. It almost reminded you of when the farm was going through a rough patch, but this time there would be no recovery. You walked along another shoreline and saw fish and other sea creatures washed up dead in massive quantities.\n\nYou\u2019ve had to fight undead monsters at almost every turn, always having to stay one step ahead before you\u2019re overwhelmed.\n\nEven the air itself feels like it\u2019s harder to breathe no matter where you go.\n\nRight now you\u2019re very far north, where nothing ever existed save ice and snow. You\u2019re living in yet another cave, but you\u2019re pretty sure this one is going to be your tomb. You haven\u2019t eaten in days, as you haven\u2019t spotted a living creature in days. You haven\u2019t seen another intelligent living creature in years.\n\nIt\u2019s very cold, and all you want to do is sleep now. You think you might have one or two more days left tops.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re not allowed to leave just yet\u2026\n\nWhile you\u2019re drifting in and out of consciousness in your weakened state, you suddenly see a dark hooded figure by the fire. You know who it is.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019ve come for me personally? I didn\u2019t think I was important enough.\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t really. Let\u2019s just say that I have a lot of free time and with less and less living now, I take a more personal approach whenever I can. Besides, given how remote this place is, I doubt if any of my necromancers could\u2019ve found you anyway. That is if I hadn\u2019t killed them all.\u201d\n\nThe Great Lich Lord\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t sound anything like you thought it might. It\u2019s actually not very scary at all. Almost calm.\n\n\u201cHeh. I killed a necromancer once\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou have my thanks then, one less treacherous fool that I didn\u2019t have to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t really need to come all this way you know, I think I was dying before you got here.\u201d\n\nAt this point the Great Lich Lord begins walking around your cave looking at your meager possessions. He immediately notices your very worn mandolin and picks it up.\n\n\u201cPlease feel free to take it. I won\u2019t be needing it anymore.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNot sure what I\u2019d do with it. I\u2019m not musically inclined at all. I\u2019m pretty much only good at killing things as you can tell.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re great at that.\u201d\n\u201cMy mistress Catalina likes music though; perhaps she might find it interesting. This looks very old, where did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cOh in a town that the demons destroyed when they lost their leader Velzix.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Demons. I think everyone was glad when I got rid of those assholes.\u201d The Great Lich Lord remarks.\n\u201cThat thing probably saved my life when I found it. Some weird ass vampire called Warnov wanted me to play for him. Said you were after him or something\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes. Vampires weren\u2019t my favorite people. Arrogant creatures. Well they\u2019re dead now. Excuse me, but did you say Warnov?\u201d\n\u201cThat was his name. Yes.\u201d\n\nThe Great Lich Lord is silent for a moment and then speaks again.\n\n\u201cI know who you are. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, but I know who you are. I remember before I tracked down and killed old Warnov, he stated that he was glad he heard you play before he died. He also said that if I ever encountered you that I should insist that you play for me before I killed you. Something about your playing being beautiful or something. You also served in the Zalan Empire army. Weren\u2019t you supposed to be a hero or something?\u201d\n\nYou laugh weakly.\n\n\u201cMostly or something.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHm. I wonder if you ever met\u2026\u201d the Great Lich Lord then pauses for a moment. \u201c\u2026nevermind. It\u2019s the past and that no longer matters. So can you still play this thing?\u201d\n\u201cWell of course, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGood. We\u2019re leaving this place then, got a job for you.\u201d\nBefore you can speak another word, you feel yourself teleported.", "action_results": [{"action": "One last song...", "result": "You find yourself in a very ornate yet definitely dark chamber. All manner of symbols related to death exist here. You could only be in the Great Lich Lord\u2019s tower in Nuro. You never thought you\u2019d ever be here. The last time you were anywhere near Nuro was forty years ago and things were much different.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Aftermath, my musical guest. As I said, I\u2019m not much for music, but Catalina is and I\u2019m sure she would love to hear you play. She\u2026\u201d The Great Lich Lord pauses again. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been feeling well lately and I think this would help out. Just take seat in that chair over there. Here\u2019s your mandolin.\u201d\n\nThis almost surreal. You didn\u2019t expect your last moments on this world to be like this. Lacking any other ideas you slowly go over to sit on the chair, while the Great Lich Lord goes to get his mistress Catalina. They better hurry up because you feel like you\u2019ve done more than knocking on death\u2019s door; you\u2019re quite literally in his home. The proximity of being so close to the Great Lich Lord is speeding up your death.\n\nThe Great Lich Lord soon arrives with Catalina and you look upon her. She\u2019s very beautiful. You had heard stories about her before decades ago when you were still serving in the army. She looks young, though she has to be much older. However, you can tell she\u2019s not exactly moving very fast and taking her time. It\u2019s apparent that despite her skill in necromancy that she\u2019s suffering from the effects of the Great Lich Lord\u2019s death aura. She must be powerful indeed to be able to withstand his proximity everyday. She must also love him very much to do it.\n\nYou briefly think of how someone could ever love such a being, or how such a being is even capable of love. But given how you see them interact, there it is.\n\nThis also starts to make you angry. Why are they allowed such a thing? They\u2019re the bad guys here. You never did anything wrong and you lost everyone you ever loved or cared about. You begin to tear up, but it\u2019s in frustration rather than sadness. All the past pain and suffering that you\u2019ve ever experienced has come back to hurt you one last time.\n\n\u201cOkay, start playing.\u201d The Great Lich Lord says.\n\u201cNo.\u201d you remark.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. No.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any position to defy me.\u201d\n\u201cOh I think I\u2019m in every position. What the hell are you going to do to me? I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 dead already! You\u2019ve already taken everything away from me! My friends and acquaintances died because of you! I lost my home because of you! My family and loved ones died because of you! I had to kill my own mother because she became one of your undead minions! My siblings, all fuckin\u2019 dead! All I have left is my music! And now you want me to give that away to you too? NO! I\u2019ll DIE with it!\u201d\n\nAfter this outburst the Great Lich Lord replies in kind.\n\n\u201cInsolent mortal! Do you forget who I am? You think dying will save you? Think again! I will kill you and raise you as a fucking zombie and MAKE you play for us in a pink dress if it so amuses me! Now play and perhaps that won\u2019t be your fate!\u201d\n\nThe Great Lich Lord\u2019s voice now sounds more menacing. More like what you thought, but you don\u2019t care, you\u2019ve got nothing to lose at this juncture. It is at this point Catalina steps in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary dear. You just let me handle this. You go in the next room and cool off or something.\u201d\n\nThe Great Lich Lord agrees to this and hugs Catalina, before walking off. Catalina now walks towards you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive my beloved\u2019s outburst. He goes a little over the top when it comes to me. Especially now. So much has happened. He\u2019s changed so much and continues to change even now. He doesn\u2019t express it, but I think it\u2019s always gotten to him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to forgive shit. Am I supposed to feel sympathy? He\u2019s caused all this\u2026and you too! How can you stand by him? You\u2019re still alive! You could probably kill him and stop this before the entire world is dead!\u201d\n\u201cOh I doubt if I could, even if I so desired, which I don\u2019t. My feelings for him and the reasons\u2026well the heart wants, what the heart wants. I sometimes worry about what he will do after I\u2019m gone though. He\u2019s in great denial. He knows I cannot fight off his overwhelming aura forever. I suppose in some ways, bringing you here to play for me was some vain hope of making me feel better. And it will, in its own way\u2026\u201d\n\nYou still can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s trying to make them out to be the victims.\n\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t care about what the hell you two death freaks want, I know what the hell I\u2019ve gone through and it\u2019s all your fault. Fuck the both of you. You haven\u2019t had to deal with the pain I\u2019ve gone through.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not. But do you think you are the only one on this world who\u2019s suffered? What makes your life and those close to you so special? Nothing. You and everyone else whoever lived on this dying world are equal. You, your family, even me. The only person who isn\u2019t equal, is in the next room. We\u2019ve all lost those close to us at some point. Yes, even my beloved and he\u2019ll lose another when I\u2019m gone. We\u2019ll all be long dead and he\u2019ll probably still be on this world by himself with nothing to do. And that, I\u2019m convinced will be the greatest suffering of all. Life without end? No thank you. When my time comes, I will embrace it.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re very surprised to hear a necromancer say that.\n\n\u201cMy beloved cannot help what he is. For whatever reason, he was gifted with the art of death. He\u2019s become it. It\u2019s his nature. You can\u2019t be angry with a force of nature. It has to simply be.\u201d\n\nYou want to argue, you want to fight, you want to bring up every moral debate you can think of, but to be quite honest you can\u2019t. Part of it is it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Part of it is you\u2019re tired of fighting, you can\u2019t do it anymore and you don\u2019t have strength at this point. The other part is that in a way what she\u2019s said makes some sense and is correct.\n\nIt also makes you think about your \u201cnature\u201d. It was to play music. You never got to live the life you wanted, but during your lifetime, music always seeped in somehow. It always found a way.\n\nCatalina continues to speak.\n\n\u201cNow you certainly don\u2019t have to play. That\u2019s your choice. I will make sure that my beloved does not turn you into dress wearing zombie though. It would be a shame though. You are not completely unfamiliar to me. I do have some knowledge of who you are and I have heard stories of your playing. I would like to hear it played while you still had the passion and energy behind it. The living spark that can only invoke such things.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll play\u2026\u201d you say with a heavy breath that took some effort for you.\n\u201cYou will?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026what did you want to hear?\u201d\n\nCatalina smiles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, whatever you like I suppose. Just as long as it has a nice soothing melody.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, I must get my beloved before you start. I must ask though, what changed your mind to play?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. It\u2019s my nature.\u201d\n\nCatalina soon returns with the Great Lich Lord and they both sit in their respective thrones. Catalina tells you to play, which you do so.\n\nYou watch the pair of them look at each other as you play. You would appear that Catalina is pleased with her \u201cgift\u201d. You don\u2019t know about the Great Lich Lord, since you can\u2019t see his face, but you assume that if she\u2019s happy, then he\u2019s happy.\n\nYou see them hold hands and look at each other as you enter the second verse of the song. At this point you begin to close your eyes and just let the music and instinct guide your fingers. You can feel your life slip away, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve been taken to a different place. A better place.\n\nYou smile and wave to your family. You can see them all so clearly. All of them are there. You\u2019re getting closer. They\u2019re ready to accept you with open arms.\n\nLast verse. Not much energy left, but you\u2019re nearly there. You won\u2019t have to worry about anything anymore. Heart slowing down. You\u2019re with them now. Everything will be so good again. Your music has saved you one last time.\n\nOne last note.\nOne last breath.\nYou\u2019re home.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, he certainly looked happier than he did earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes he did. Set his body on fire dear.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want him around to play for you later?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that performance could ever be replicated.\u201d", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Run back down the mountain", "result": "You\u2019re having difficulty concentrating, but you decide that it would be better to distance yourself from the creature rather than trapping yourself in a cave.\n\nYou attempt to head down the mountain, but you really are feel very sick and dizzy, in fact you\u2019re beginning to feel worse.

I really miss Mallack.\n\nI was in contact with a woman by the name of Helena. She was a traveling merchant who I met years ago during my tour in Retlad. We had a relationship of sorts I suppose. We met whenever she was in the area I was stationed in. Dunno why I never told you about her, I guess I just felt weird about telling you. Silly now that I think about it.\n\nAnyway, she was in the city of Edat a few months ago when it was utterly destroyed. I suggested that she should just stay in the Retlad province since the fighting wasn\u2019t as bad there, but she said there was a big deal to be made in Edat, so she went. Reports say there were no survivors. Of course reports have been wrong before and I have used some of my connections to find out for certain but considering the carnage that occurred I hold little hope.\n\nI\u2019ll miss her.

This is something I\u2019d rather discuss with you in person, of course if I ever got a chance to visit every once in awhile!\n\nOkay, the Captain\u2019s starting to call everyone.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Letters to home (She's still alive!)", "result": "Hey Mallack!\n\nThis letter is directly for you again. Glad you\u2019ve been keeping these between us.\n\nAnyway, I know it seemed silly to worry about a girl I just had a brief encounter with years ago for one night. But when I heard about the Brot Kingdom being destroyed by the Necromancer, I did wonder about Helena.\n\nWell, I found out she\u2019s still alive! She stopped off in Fort Virtue not too long ago! She wasn\u2019t in Brot when all that shit went down. She was trading in the Azi Republic at the time.\n\nWhen she arrived in Fort Virtue to trade, I recognized her and she seemed pleased to see me. She mentioned that she was pleased to see a familiar face for once and we spent a lot of time together for as long as she stayed. (And yes, we did THAT several times too.)\n\nI wish things were different, or at least not the way they are right now. I definitely would want to pursue a more permanent relationship with her because we get along really well, but alas that\u2019s not to be. At least not at this time.\n\nShe told me she was heading to the Retlad Kingdom next; I hope she stays there because there\u2019s less fighting going on. Definitely no more Quillars there anymore. I dunno, I know it\u2019s minor and doesn\u2019t really make sense, but this little bit of info sort of put me in a better mood. I guess I\u2019ll be writing Mom a more upbeat letter as well soon.\n\nOkay, well I hope everything\u2019s going good with you too.

Said I could be a \u201creal\u201d hero and a bunch of other stuff. Part of it sounded appealing, but something about him made me feel really uncomfortable.\n\nI wonder if I\u2019m just avoiding my \u201cpotential.\u201d Like perhaps I am supposed to be some great general or warrior, or whatever. But I just don\u2019t feel that desire within me.

Just events didn\u2019t work out for me I guess, but even within this situation, I\u2019ve still found a way to indulge in my passion and I suppose it\u2019s better than never being able to at all.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps one day all of this will be over and I\u2019ll come out of this alive and manage to pursue music without hindrance.\n\nI know that sounds a little uncharacteristically optimistic from me, but I guess I still have a little hope left after all.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family\n\nYour son", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Accept the offer", "result": "You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit.

I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, but if I\u2019m already in the shit, I might as well go all the way with it. What do I do next?\u201d\n\nWarnov looks around again to see if anyone is about before answering.\n\n\u201cWell just take a deep breath, relax and uh\u2026 brace yourself!\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nBefore you can react Warnov moves faster than you\u2019ve ever seen anything move. In fact you don\u2019t really see him move at all before he\u2019s biting your neck! He puts his other hand over your mouth so you can\u2019t yell out and easily knocks your hand away from feebly attempting to draw a weapon.\n\nYou fall into unconsciousness as your blood is drained from you at a rapid rate.

Someone else could\u2019ve popped up and that would\u2019ve gotten complicated\u2026\u201d\n\nYou quickly check your neck which is completely healed now, but you know what\u2019s just occurred! You feel a cold numbness throughout your body and you freak out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019M DEAD! I\u2019M FUCKIN DEAD! And you\u2019re a vampire!\u201d\n\u201cShhhh! Keep your voice down! Yeah, you figured it out. Nice detective work, now let\u2019s get down to this hero business.

No, no, no, we\u2019re not\u2026 look I\u2019ll explain later, let\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\nYou pull away from Warnov when he tries to help you up. You feel your reflexes are much quicker. This temporary curiousity in your new found abilities allows Warnov to calm you down.\n\n\u201cWAIT! Just stop! (Sigh) Okay look I\u2019ll try to give you the condensed version right now. We vampires aren\u2019t on the side of the Necromancer Lord. If anything he\u2019s fucking things up for us. We like to keep a balanced order as it were. The last time we sided with some megalomaniacal necromancer it nearly resulted in our extinction. Never again. In fact we\u2019ve been manipulating shit for centuries just to make sure something like this didn\u2019t happen. Somebody really fucked up in the observation department on this one!\u201d\n\nWarnov goes on to explain that his superior, Lord Rostov will be able to explain better and in more detail, but that you have to come with him now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Warnov", "result": "While this is all a lot to take in, you manage to calm down.\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay. I\u2019m calm, but\u2026man this is a lot of shit.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHeh, well you did say you might as well go with it! Don\u2019t worry; it\u2019ll all be second nature soon. Okay let\u2019s go see Lord Rostov.\u201d\n\nWarnov pulls out a black cube and teleports you to what seems to be the inside of a castle.\n\n\u201cAlright, YOU stay right here in the foyer! Don\u2019t go wandering around, I\u2019m serious! You\u2019re not quite in the fold yet, I have to go straighten this out and explain all this to Lord Rostov. I\u2019ll be back to come get you later. Everything will be explained in full detail soon.\u201d\n\nNot wishing to piss off anyone and being completely out of your element you stay put. The foyer has enough to keep you occupied though, you begin examining many of the paintings and statues to pass the time.\n\nSoon, Warnov returns with a very regal looking vampire. You can only assume that this is Lord Rostov.\n\n\u201cWelcome, I\u2019m sure you have ask many questions for me as I have for you, so we\u2019ll just get right to it. We\u2019ll walk and talk on the way to the throne room. Don\u2019t worry about anyone listening. There are no secrets here.\u201d Lord Rostov says.\n\u201cOkay\u2026I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBUT! Remember to address me as Lord Rostov if you are going to address me by name.\u201d Lord Rostov adds with authority.\n\nYou take notice and obey, though Lord Rostov has such a commanding presence that you would be hard pressed not to obey him.\n\nYour questions are typical for someone brought into the fold. Rostov goes on about how his kind have been manipulating the mortal world for centuries just like Warnov said before. Several of the known governments have at least one vamp keeping an eye on things. Apparently many high ranking political types in your own Zalan Empire are vampires! The Grand Alliance is even a tool of the vampires.\n\nWhile Lord Rostov goes on about this fascinating history lesson, you look at some of his \u201ccourt\u201d as you walk through his castle. Some of them are more \u201cmortal looking\u201d than others. Some look down right hideous. You always thought vampires were supposed to be ultra attractive, but you can see that isn\u2019t necessarily the case. When you get to his throne room Lord Rostov stops and turns to you.\n\n\u201cSo I hear you want to be a real hero eh? Well this is the place where they\u2019re made.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think most heroes are always storming dungeons and doing impossible things? They don\u2019t get those abilities without some help. The supernatural skill comes into play and dungeons aren\u2019t exactly beacons of light!\u201d Lord Rostov laughs.\n\n\u201cY\u2026you mean ALL the heroes in the world are vampires?!\u201d\n\u201cHah! I wish that was the case. No, there are many regular mortal heroes that do their part I suppose, but if you want the really legendary ones that have done impossible deeds, well chances are there was a vampire involved. Sadly we haven\u2019t been too much more successful than the mortals in the heroics department lately.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been going on exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat little annoying necromancer lord, or whatever he thinks he is, has been proving to be a lot cleverer than what was previously believed. His armies have been growing in strength and I\u2019m sure you know about the undead giant business and crushing the Brot Kingdom. What isn\u2019t commonly known is how he accomplished it. He had help from one of our kind. A loathsome outcast known as the Ghoul King. (Sigh) Should\u2019ve killed him long ago really, but\u2026bah, it\u2019s a long story. We\u2019ll deal with him when the time comes. What\u2019s more alarming is that we\u2019ve sent assassins\u2026or heroes to kill the necromancer lord and his bitch and he\u2019s somehow managed to kill all of them. I mean I can somewhat understand them being killed by that brutish demon tyrant Velzix, but a fucking necromancer? He\u2019s a fucking mortal! And from what we know of him, he wasn\u2019t even that good of a wizard to begin with!\u201d\n\nSuddenly Lord Rostov flies into a rage, yelling and punches a hole into the solid brick wall. Many of his court, as well as you and Warnov back away. He then stops and composes himself.\n\n\u201cMy apologies to you all. It\u2019s been a trying time with upstart mortals and traitors and other annoyances. And to you, the newest member of our fold.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no need to apologize to me Lord Rostov. It\u2019s your home after all\u201d You say which causes him to smile.\n\u201cCarefully chosen words. Not overly sycophantic, yet still displaying the right subservient mindset. You should fit in very well here.\u201d\n\u201cBut I meant it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! And honest too! You\u2019re more interesting than how Warnov described you. I have heard that you were one of those minor mortal heroes I was talking about earlier, but more interesting to me, is apparently you have talent in the musical field?\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\u201cWell, play something for me! All of us!\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you want to hear?\u201d\n\u201cSurprise me, if you\u2019re able!\u201d\n\nLord Rostov sits on his throne while his court whispers among themselves and then go quiet waiting for you to play. You pull out your lute and try to think of a song that they might like. You think of an old song that once was very popular among the aristocracy. Seems like a perfect crowd\u2026\n\nYou begin to concentrate on the music and nothing but the music. You play as if your life was in danger, which you\u2019re somewhat certain that it isn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to play your best right now.\n\nYour new supernatural reflexes certainly come in handy as you\u2019re able to hit notes and play faster than you normally would\u2019ve been able to as a mortal.\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished you look around the room which is still silence until Lord Rostov gets off his throne and begins clapping. Everyone else follows suit.\n\n\u201cThat was magnificent! I heard the original bard who performed that piece three hundred years ago and even he couldn\u2019t have done a better job! Warnov, this man is too valuable to make into a hero!\u201d\n\u201cLord Rostov?\u201d\n\u201cWhile this man may have combat skills as you described, he is obviously a musician! Such talent such not be wasted in battle! Beautiful playing!\u201d\n\u201cWhile I agree he is a good musician Lord Rostov, I think we should consider the matter of the necromancer\u2026\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Warnov, I was feeling good until you mentioned that mortal again! Nevertheless you are right. But still, this shall be HIS choosing. Not ours.\u201d\n\nLord Rostov turns to you.\n\n\u201cThe decision shall be yours broodling. You may if you wish under go extensive training to prepare yourself for an encounter with that little necromancer lord. If you succeed, your name will be known, and you will become a legend. However, I can sense that such things are probably not your nature. Music is. I can see that you would be content to just play your music for an appreciative crowd. You could do that here. You could also learn songs that I have possession of, but sadly unable to play with the same spirit that you obviously have.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my family? And my job and all that?\u201d\n\u201cAh, your mortal life. I\u2019m sure Warnov will already be taking steps to explain that you have been transferred from your current assignment. Considering he\u2019s part of intelligence, nobody will ask too many questions, even if they bothered to. As for your family, they will be taken care of as you will still officially be part of the Zalan army. If you wish you may stay in contact with them through letters. Possibly arrangements can be made for you to visit them. During the night of course. But under NO circumstances will you tell them about any of this. Doing so would ruin my generous offer and be extremely bad for you. I don\u2019t think we need to dwell on such depressing things because I know you\u2019re smarter than that right?\u201d\n\u201cYes Lord Rostov.\u201d\n\u201cGood, now what is it that you would like to do?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Be a hero", "result": "While the offer of playing for what could possibly be eternity is tempting, part of you has been affected by world events and the war going on. You have come to realize that the Necromancer (and the demons) need to be stopped. If you can take an active role in that, then you\u2019ll know for sure that your family will be safe in the near future. You did do all this for your family after all, and while your path has definitely undergone a change, you\u2019re still going to put them first.\n\nBesides, you\u2019re a vampire now, you\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll have tons of time to play later if all goes well. You\u2019re definitely nervous about this decision, but you\u2019re going to make it.\n\n\u201cLord Rostov, I wish to begin your advanced combat training.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well, though I almost hoped that you wouldn\u2019t. Your playing was just divine and you won\u2019t be able to play again for a long time during your extensive training time. Possibly never if you fail\u2026but let us hope that you do not fail! It would be a loss for all of us. Warnov escourt him to the lower dungeons.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Lord Rostov.\u201d\n\nWarnov takes you into the lower dungeons of the castle just as Lord Rostov commanded. Warnov tells you that this isn\u2019t going to be easy and that you better condition your mind to almost a pure instinctive level because you could very well die in training!\n\nFinally you reach a large barren room with a pair of large doors on the far end.\n\n\u201cThis is it. Just keep an eye on the large door over there and well, brace yourself!\u201d\n\nYou half expect to get bitten again after hearing those words, but instead Warnov quickly steps out of the room and locks the door leaving you alone. The large doors on the other side of the room start to open.\n\nAnd you just realized that you don\u2019t have a weapon\u2026\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nYou survive your rigorous training. You have fought all manner of dangerous beasts with and without weapons. (And feasting on their blood for survival) You have undergone pain you didn\u2019t think possible even in your new undead state. You\u2019re definitely a better killing machine than you were.\n\nYou were allowed to write letters to your family which were overlooked first by Lord Rostov of course to make sure you weren\u2019t saying something you shouldn\u2019t. You barely know what to tell them except keeping your lies to a minimum about your supposed new job with Zalan intelligence. You have dedicated and conditioned yourself to combat so much that you don\u2019t even think about music. You briefly wonder if you\u2019ve \u201clost\u201d something, but you then dismiss such things as you must focus on battle.\n\nDuring this time you have been informed that the Necromancer Lord as well as Velzix have grown in power. Lord Rostov says though that he believes the demons will pose no serious threat if a concentrated effort can be made on them by the mortals. However, for that to happen, the Necromancer Lord must die and that\u2019s where you come in and what you\u2019ve been training for.\n\nHowever, you won\u2019t be going in by yourself. A band of \u201cheroes\u201d will be necessary for a job like this. You are told you will meet the others in a small abandoned village bordering on the Necromancer\u2019s Domain.\n\nAnother vampire takes you there with the aid of a black teleportation cube. This is a one way trip. You\u2019re not coming back unless you win. That and the fact that the black cubes can\u2019t possibly be allowed to fall into enemy hands.\n\nThere you meet the others. They look unimpressed with you, but you\u2019re a little surprised to see one of them. She\u2019s very well known\u2026a \u201chero\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Deliah the Deathdealer! You fought at the battle of Azark and you also retrieved the Celestial Sword! You\u2019re a hero! I didn\u2019t know you were\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they tell you all this shit when you started training? Sheesh, we gotta get paired up with some broodling\u2026\u201d a brutish vampire interrupts.\n\u201cQuiet Gorax! I\u2019m sure he was, but meeting a legend is a lot different from basking in their glory in person.\u201d Deliah replies.\n\u201cGorax!? Gorax the Mighty? You were a barbarian king that held back the orc hordes over a hundred years ago!\u201d you say in amazement.\n\u201cHuh, fat lot good that did me. I can\u2019t take any credit for of my deeds today and barely anyone remembers my past deeds except some useless tribal shamen that now cower from the undead hordes in the Drozz Plains. Feh! Back in my day such men would not allow mere ghouls run them off their lands! I don\u2019t know why Rostov won\u2019t allow me to go in, seek out, and just chop off that retched Ghoul King\u2019s head! He\u2019s partially to blame for this mess!\u201d\n\u201cOh you know Rostov, he has his reasons. Besides, if we take out the Necromancer lord, the Ghoul King will probably be our next assignment.\u201d Another vampire says in a bored tone. This one looks like he was once a Halfling. It almost makes you laugh to think of a vampire Halfling, but there he is. You don\u2019t know who he is or was, but given the other two, he was probably important at one time.\n\n\u201cSo are you ready to go broodling? Or are you going to stand there with a dumb look on your face?\u201d Delilah asks.\n\u201cUh sure, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nThe trip into the Necromancer\u2019s Domain is surprisingly quick and uneventful. You attempt to make conversation as you can\u2019t help now but be curious about your companions, but all of them are less than talkative and forthcoming. Deliah eventually takes you aside harshly.\n\n\u201cLook broodling, we\u2019ve got a job to do. A fucking dangerous one at that! We all need to be in focus and not concentrating on anything else! So keep your damn questions to yourself and if you happen to survive this encounter THEN perhaps you may get a little more information from us and our fascinating history. Until then, stay in the fucking dark!\u201d\n\nThe rest of the trip is silent.\n\nAt last you reach the city of Nuro and easily scale its walls and onto the battlements while remaining undetected the whole time. This is a lot different from what it was when you arrived here as a mortal. That memory still gives you a bit of pause. You remember how scared you were back then.\n\n\u201cHurry up broodling! These walking corpses might not be able to detect us, but the Necromancer will soon! We need to get the advantage as soon as possible! Gorax, Wally you go through the front of the main tower. I\u2019m sure you two can handle that. While whatever guards rush to defend their master, me and the broodling will scale the tower and go in through one of the top windows.\n\n\u201cYou sure about that Delilah? Would you rather I go with you than some broodling?\u201d Wally asks.\n\u201cYeah, but if I leave him with Gorax he\u2019ll probably get killed in the fighting and be useless. At least if he\u2019s with me, he can serve as an extra body for the Necromancer Lord to draw his attention to.\u201d\n\u201cHEY! I\u2019m right here y\u2019know!\u201d you exclaim indignantly which causes Deliah to smack you in the face hard. You didn\u2019t even see it coming.\n\u201cShut the fuck up! You\u2019ll draw attention! Look if we pull this off just maybe you\u2019ll come out of this alive. I need you to take care of the Necromancer\u2019s bitch anyway. She\u2019s probably up there with him. Now let\u2019s do this!\u201d\n\nThe plan is set into action. Gorax and Wally make their presence known immediately jumping off the battlements and into the courtyard while yelling at the top of their lungs.\n\n\u201cIntruder! Protect the master!\u201d you hear a scratchy voice yell in the distance, while you and Delilah sneak around, jumping onto the rooftops and attempting to avoid the main fighting force. A few flying shadows try to stop you, but they\u2019re easily dispatched with your bow and silver arrows. Delilah looks glad that you aren\u2019t entirely useless and you and her proceed to scale the walls.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this place isn\u2019t more protected.\u201d You say while climbing.\n\u201cHeh, he\u2019s got his troops all spread out and mostly on his borders, plus he\u2019s grown more arrogant and confident. That will be his undoing.\u201d She replies quickly.\n\n\u201cFunny I was about to say the same for you bloodsuckers.\u201d A voice says causing the both of you to look up.\n\nA raven haired female leans over the nearby window above Delilah and blast her directly in the face burning it off with a beam of light. You certainly weren\u2019t expecting a necromancer to cast any sort of spell like that! You then see Delilah fall\u2026and get impaled through the chest by a weathervane. A fucking weathervane. Unbelievable.\n\nYou attempt to scale the wall to the nearest window under you and just barely get out of the way of the lady necromancer\u2019s next spell.\n\nYou have no idea where you are in the tower, but you can hear fighting going on outside and a couple of hearty roars which you can only guess is Gorax.\n\nA quick scan would indicate that you\u2019re in some sort of library. You cautiously proceed and decide that finding stairs that lead up would be the way to go. You just hope you\u2019re ready to take him on and his mistress.\n\nAs you make your way through, you fight all manner of undead sentries: Wraiths, ghosts, skeletal warriors, etc. During one of your moments of hiding a couple of wight guards run by talking in a hoarse tone.\n\n\u201cThe big one and little one are dead! We must find the last one! Quick Quick!\u201d\n\u201cYes Yes! The master must be protected!\u201d\n\nYou come to the very real feeling of having been in the position before\u2026all alone, surrounded by hostile undead, and in Nuro\u2026\n\nYour resolve breaks a little and you wish that you weren\u2019t here. You want to go home.\n\nEventually you push yourself forward, but somehow fear has crept back into your own dead heart. To your credit you do reach the top of the tower, but the Necromancer\u2019s mistress once again surprises you. A ray of light sears your face off and destroys your vision. You fall to the cold stone floor in extreme pain and can only make out blurry images.\n\nYou see a blurred black hooded figure approach. You can\u2019t see his face, but this could only be who you think it is. You attempt to reach for your sword.\n\n\u201cMore assassins? I swear something is going to have to be done about these bloodsuckers. The Ghoul King\u2019s kin are really starting to get on my nerves. These ones weren\u2019t even a challenge. What are you doing bloodsucker? Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s futile?\u201d\n\nThe Necromancer Lord unleashes a ball of flame that engulfs your body, putting an end to your undead existence.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Be a musician", "result": "This is all you\u2019ve ever wanted. Just play music. You\u2019ll be able to do it now for all eternity if possible.

Your talents will be better served here. In the meantime you will be shown to your new room. Ladies, I think you two should escort our new bard.

They seem to make a fuss over you on your way there which you don\u2019t find completely unwelcome, but you\u2019re still getting used to the whole idea that you\u2019re a vampire just like one of them now, despite also being excited over getting to play music on a steady basis with no hindrances.\n\nThe two vampiresses get even friendlier with you when you get to the room. Natasha begins to take a more aggressive stance and kisses you as the pair of you get on the bed. As the two of you are undressing, Natasha who is on top of you nods to Glasya who leaves the room.\n\nTen minutes later as you\u2019re fully engaged in physical pleasure, Glasya enters the room again with what looks to be a captive human girl. She doesn\u2019t look very old either. Probably a teenager. Her mouth is gagged so she can\u2019t scream out properly.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2019s all this?\u201d\n\u201cShhhh, your passage to true vampirehood\u2026\u201d the Natasha says continuing to grind into you.\n\nThe human girl is dragged over to the bed with fear and tears in her eyes the whole time. Glasya draws out a blade and holds it to her throat.\n\n\u201cWould you like me to cut now or would you prefer I prolong the fear? Perhaps remove her gag first so that you may hear her screams? Or maybe you\u2019d even like to sink your teeth into her yourself?\u201d Glasya asks and licks the side of the young girl\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhat? Shit! No wait!\u201d you say stopping Natasha, and sitting up. \u201cI thought we were just having some fun here! Not killing young girls!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do the two need to be mutually exclusive? Broodling, you have been favored by Lord Rostov, I suggest you count yourself lucky and get with the program\u2026besides you\u2019re one of us now, you will need to feed on blood to survive.\u201d Glasya says with a frown.\n\nYou look at the girl and you shake you head briefly realizing what else it means to be a vampire.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I got it. But can\u2019t I like feed on animals first and uh work my way up or something?\u201d\n\u201cSqueamish broodling! You will take the blood of this girl or Lord Rostov will hear of this weakness! While he may be impressed with your music abilities, he will not tolerate weaklings!\u201d Glasya continues to scold.\n\u201cBesides, why do you care whether this\u2026mortal lives or dies now? You do not know her and you are now superior to her in everyway. It\u2019s your right\u2026\u201d Natasha says while kissing on your body.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any choice in the matter. You almost curse yourself for getting yourself into this situation. You stay silent for awhile and then speak.\n\n\u201cVery well. Slit her throat, but do it quickly.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) Very well.\u201d Glasya replies disappointedly.\n\nThe young girl\u2019s throat is slashed and blood sprays over you and Natasha who greedily opens her mouth to catch it. Glaysa tosses the girl\u2019s dying body onto your chest and begins to undress as well to join you and Natasha in this blood feast.\n\nThe night is definitely long, memorable and decadent. A little piece of you has \u201cdied\u201d namely the vestiges of morality.\n\nA few months pass and you don\u2019t even hesitate anymore. You enjoy the blood as well as your playing for Lord Rostov\u2019s court.\n\nA year passes and you\u2019ve become completely oblivious to the worsening of the \u201coutside world\u201d. (Which you don\u2019t even think about since you\u2019re so rapped up in your own pleasures) Each day the Necromancer Lord and Velzix get stronger and you stopped worrying about your family\u2019s future. You don\u2019t even write to them anymore. You\u2019ve become so corrupted in such a short amount of time its actually amazing.\n\nAnother year passes and you\u2019re basically a hedonist. This is what Lord Rostov\u2019s \u201csecret fortress\u201d is all about for the most part. Sure there\u2019s discussion on what should be done about the outside problems, but pleasures of the flesh and blood are mainly the orders of the night. You don\u2019t even realize it, but you ARE literally a \u201cleech\u201d now. All vampires have ever done is leech off of the mortal world. Sure there are the \u201cactive ones\u201d but there are far more hedonists. Ironic that the ones who choose to be professional killers, assassins or \u201cheroes\u201d tend to still retain more of their mortalhood.\n\nLord Rostov eventually mentions in passing that he\u2019s finally come up with a perfect plan to kill the Necromancer Lord. He\u2019s managed to come to some sort of deal with that old outcast The Ghoul King to betray him sometime in the near future. The goal is to lure the Necromancer Lord to the fortress itself and kill him directly.\n\nAgain you could really care less, and you\u2019ve become little more than just another hedonist in Lord Rostov\u2019s court. Lord Rostov has it all figured out, you don\u2019t need to worry. You\u2019re safe in this little \u201cworld.\u201d\n\nA few months pass and the plan swings into action. One night while you\u2019re playing for the court as usual a loud noise is heard in the foyer and the sounds of shouting and crashing is heard. Lord Rostov takes a few of his concubines and tell everyone else to stay put, though everyone is a little curious. Even you.\n\nYou go back to playing a little bit and things are starting to return to their \u201coriginal state\u201d since everyone figures Lord Rostov has the matter well in hand.\n\nSoon another noise is heard which sounds like the shrieking and screaming of multiple people.\n\n\u201cAAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\u201cLORD ROSTOV! NO!\u201d\n\u201cGET HIM!\u201d\n\u201cKILL THE NECROMANCER!\u201d\n\nEveryone for once goes into a battle mode to rush to Lord Rostov\u2019s aid. A deformed and ugly creature runs into you, while you\u2019re trying to wrap your mind around this chaos.\n\n\u201cGet outta my way broodling! He\u2019s gonna kill us all! I\u2019ve fucked up\u2026heh, but at least the rest of you fuckers are going to die!\u201d he growls at you while desperately looking for a place to hide.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to do, but suddenly you feel a presence overcome you. Like someone is controlling your mind. This isn\u2019t even like Lord Rostov, its even more powerful and its growing stronger\u2026\n\nYou continue to hear the screams of vampires as you can\u2019t help but approach the way to the slaughter. You see vampires killing each other in the hallway! How is this possible? But you know why, it\u2019s HIM\u2026\n\nThe Necromancer\u2026or whatever he is now has managed to enforce his will even over vampires. You see him in the distance. He\u2019s not even dirtying his hands killing all of you himself. You can feel his loathing for your kind and then you\u2019re completely pulled into his domination.\n\n\u201cAnd now little blood leech you shall join your brethren\u2026\u201d you hear him whisper in your mind.\n\nAnother vampire suddenly punches you in the back of the head. You attempt to get up, but then feel a foot to the face followed by a sword going through your back. At this point you feel a something you haven\u2019t felt in a long time, fear.\n\nThen your head is ripped off in the ensuing bloodbath.

Some blood spurts out and a surprised look on his face is displayed and then he falls dead. You\u2019ve killed him. You\u2019ve never killed anything before that wasn\u2019t a Kobold or livestock. You feel weird.\n\nIn the meantime Dimitri gets up and pulls the dagger out of his leg and looks over at Formeli\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cHeh, maybe you are a killer after all pig farmer. Well it seems we got an opening now. Take whatever he had as your own. You killed him, you earned it. Welcome to the Chimera Mercenary Company!\u201d\n\nWhile you MAY be in, you\u2019re not necessarily sure if you want in. This may be a bit too much for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join anyway", "result": "You know this isn\u2019t going to be easy and you\u2019re going to have to be tough, but you remember that you\u2019re doing this for your family. You quickly search Formeli\u2019s body, which didn\u2019t have that much to begin with.\n\n\u201cHeh, he always was a broke bastard. Spent all his money on gambling, I\u2019ll miss taking his money that\u2019s for sure. Alright then, you\u2019ll probably be wantin\u2019 to take that sword of his since it looks in way better condition than your rusted hunk of iron. Your bow seems to do the job just fine though. His armor too, and hurry up, we gotta meet the Boss! He\u2019s got another job for us no doubt.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re stripping off some of the armor, Dimitri notices something on your back.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the hell is that boy? Is that a fuckin\u2019 lute? Haw haw! What the fuck are you doin\u2019 with a damn lute? You think that you\u2019re some sort of bard or something? We ain\u2019t got need for such things boy! Get rid of it!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine.\u201d You defiantly say.\nYou wonder if this show of \u201ccourage\u201d has gotten you into a whole mess of trouble that you don\u2019t want, but fortunately it doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHeh, he kills one shithead and now he thinks he\u2019s a tough guy! Alright pig farmer keep your sissy lute. But its just more weight for you to carry and you better not be falling behind! Come on men let\u2019s go, the Boss is waiting for us. You too lute boy!\u201d Dimitri exclaims and limps off. You briefly thought about telling him that he better keep up with his wounded leg and all, but you know when to stop.\n\nAnd so your mercenary life begins.\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re currently back in the Zalan Empire on a break in between missions. While most of your \u201cbuddies\u201d are drinking up their pay and spending it on whores you take this opportunity to visit your family and give them your payment and spoils of battle as usual.\n\nYou think about how much you\u2019ve traveled and experienced. Not all of it good, but then killing is never pretty. Some of the jobs are very straight forward: \u201cThere are some orc barbarians on the borders that have been pillaging our lands, kill them.\u201d And you don\u2019t have a problem with it. Other missions start falling into the \u201cgray\u201d area.\n\nYour last job involved some Azi Republic senator hiring the company to take out some secessionists that wanted to form their own country. It wasn\u2019t clean and it definitely wasn\u2019t fun. The secessionists actually had a reasonable complaint about leaving the Republic, saying that it was corrupt and that their representatives didn\u2019t care about them. But being a mercenary means you don\u2019t take sides for moral or ideological reasons, you do it for money.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that though, some of the things that have been done\u2026well you can\u2019t say you\u2019re too proud of it. Granted, you\u2019ve never actively engaged in some of the less moral and outright criminal things that your mercenary comrades have, but you certainly know about them and it almost makes you feel like you\u2019re guilty of it as well.\n\nAs for how you cope with some of this stuff, you tend to keep to yourself and play your lute which has oddly made you a little more accepted. Seems there are more than a few music lovers in the company. Even the Captain doesn\u2019t mind you indulging in your little hobby. The Captain is a huge man who you know gets a pleasure from killing and mayhem. He\u2019s spent a lifetime doing it. In fact you have a hard time believing he even has a family that he goes to visit. Who knows though? Perhaps he is different with them.\n\n(You\u2019ve been working for the Chimera Company for a year and you still don\u2019t know what the hell his real name is, mainly because everyone only seems to address him as \u201cThe Boss\u201d or \u201cChief\u201d or in a more formal tone \u201cCaptain\u201d)\n\nYou spend the time with your family and tell them of some of the things you\u2019ve seen and exciting places you\u2019ve been to, of course never going into too much detail about the darker side of things. Your brothers and sisters enjoy the tales as usual. Your Mom senses that there is probably more to them, but she doesn\u2019t ask too many questions. She does always asks if you\u2019re okay and says that you don\u2019t have to keep doing it, but you always reply that you\u2019re fine and that you\u2019re just a little tired that\u2019s all.\n\nWhen your time is done you say goodbye to them and meet with the rest of your company at the Zalan capital this time. Its odd, but things seem to be even more chaotic than usual around here. People are rushing around and an air of concern seems to be pervading the city.\n\nThe guards are telling people to calm down our there will be martial law and you hear something in passing about an attack on a city. You don\u2019t really listen because you\u2019re in a hurry to meet up with your company which you find mostly hanging out in a tavern as usual.\n\nDimitri sees you and speaks.\n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s our own fuckin\u2019 bard ! How\u2019s my favorite string plucker? (Hic!) You have trouble getting into the city? Heard the guards have been cracking down on security.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but what\u2019s going on? The city seems to be in a state of panic.\u201d\n\u201cFuck yeah it is! What you didn\u2019t hear?\u201d\n\u201cNo. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 undead happened my pig farming friend! A whole shitload of them took over the the city of Nuro! Can you believe it? Fuckin\u2019 Nuro! That place was supposed to be unconquerable! Heh! (Burp!)\u201d Dimitri says without the slightest bit of worry.\n\u201cUNDEAD?! What the fuck? Nuro!? How?!\u201d\n\u201cFuck if I know, guess some rogue wizards got hooked up in that necromancy shit hardcore. Musta been some demonologists there too since we heard reports of demons too. Not the supposedly civilized type either, they\u2019re the rip off your head and shit down your neck kind.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026there\u2019s fuckin\u2019 rogue demons in Nuro too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, they all escaped and are now running around in the countryside, heard they\u2019re heading for the Tulan Kingdom.\u201d Dimitri says taking another drink.\n\nYou\u2019re having a hard time digesting all this yet the rest of your comrades are still drinking and partying like nothing is wrong. Your Dad had once told you tales of a being called the Great Lich Lord that existed many centuries ago who nearly killed the world. Scared the hell out of you then and it doesn\u2019t make you feel too good now.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this concerning to you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Shit no! Just means more work for us and that also means more loot! Ha ha! You could get more loot to buy a new lute! Ha ha ha! (Hic!)\u201d\n\u201cBut this is the fuckin\u2019 undead! I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo? Stop bein a pussy! I\u2019ve fought some undead before, when I was lootin\u2019 a dwarven tomb. You just chop their heads off like everything else, shit ain\u2019t that hard. They just tend to smell worse\u2026well maybe not worse than trolls. Anyway I\u2019m sure the fucking governments will take care of this shit as quick as possible, you know how politicians don\u2019t like dead taxpayers, in the meantime we need to take advantage now while the conflict is hot!\u201d\n\nNo sooner has Dimitri said this little bit of wisdom, when the Boss steps in the doorway. He\u2019s as nasty looking as always, but this time he looks even moreso than usual.\n\n\u201cAlright you useless sacks of goblin shit. We got a new job. This one just came across rather unexpectedly. Ran into a Dwarven representative and we\u2019re now in the employ of a Dwarven Clan, near the southern Tulan Borders. With the occurrence of this Nuro incident, they\u2019re expecting some shit to spill over into their lands and they want some extra help. This is pretty surprising since Dwarves aren\u2019t known to pay for mercenaries, let alone the likes of us.\u201d The Boss tell you all.\n\u201cThe Tulan Border? Oh fuck that place is a meat grinder! There\u2019s no profit to be had anywhere near there!\u201d Cal pipes up.\n\u201cWell you can just pick up your panties and get your pansy ass back home and stay there then! The dwarves are paying well and that\u2019s the job. Take it or get the fuck outta my company!\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me Captain, but weren\u2019t there reports of demons running through that area?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah so? That\u2019s why we\u2019re going over there most likely, but be fucking prepared for any damn thing. Maybe even undead\u2026who knows if my\u2026if those necromancer bastards started spreading their plague yet. We leave tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou think on this fucked up situation and seriously reconsidering your career choice.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the mercenary company", "result": "Nope, you\u2019re not doing this. This is suicide in your opinion. You have no idea what to expect and it sound a lot more dangerous than anything you\u2019ve ever faced.\n\nInstead of leaving with them the next day, you go back home. You don\u2019t worry about anyone coming after you, but you know you won\u2019t be welcomed back into the company again, and you wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\n\nWhen you get back home, your family and mom in particular ask what happened, you explain it and say you don\u2019t want any part of that life. You apologize that you couldn\u2019t go through with it, but your mom looks more relieved than anything.\n\n\u201cWell son, I\u2019m just as glad you didn\u2019t go get yourself killed over there anyway. You\u2019ll be helping us out plenty just by working on the farm like always.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re glad to hear that. Over the next couple days you fall back into routine again. You still wonder about the future though and you briefly consider the army plan again, but given your short lived experience with mercenary \u201clife\u201d you don\u2019t think you\u2019re cut out with battle on a regular basis. Plus the Zalan Empire is currently on heightened alert and battle ready status with this Nuro Incident and all.\n\nYou resign yourself to the farm life. You play your lute to yourself (and family) when you have the time to do so. It\u2019s a simple life.\n\nTwo years pass and things have gotten worse. The Necromancer Lord (as he\u2019s become to be known) has expanded, even to the point of taking over the Brot Kingdom. The Tulan Kingdom has been totally conquered by a demon army. A Grand Alliance of nations has been formed, but so far they don\u2019t seem to be making much progress.\n\nMeanwhile life on the farm is a little harder. Your youngest sister Makana becomes gravely ill during the winter months, but there\u2019s not enough money to pay for a healer and most of the clerics have been summoned to battle with the undead or demon hordes. Sadly she dies making the overall mood of the farm a little more depressing. You don\u2019t even play anymore, your enthusiasm for music died along with the grim realities setting in.\n\nAnother three years pass and things are down right miserable. War is everywhere. The Demons have been taken care of, (You heard your former mercenary captain died in battle with their leader Velzix) but the undead are stronger than ever. Reports even speak of the Necromancer Lord becoming The Great Lich Lord \u201creborn\u201d.\n\nTo make things worse, the Zalan Empire has been becoming increasingly tyrannical. In order to help with the war effort they\u2019ve started bringing back the draft and the talk of ceasing private property to be used for the good of the government. While they say owners will be able to live and still work on their lands and businesses, it will be owned by the Empire.\n\nYou know it\u2019s only a matter of time when you get a knock on the door by Zalan army troops coming to take you and your brother Mallack away to the army and your family\u2019s farm.\n\nAnother two year pass\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019re on the eve of battle in a land known as the Garwold Confederacy although it\u2019s steadily becoming a giant graveyard now. The undead hordes have been sweeping relentlessly across the entire landscape. Your own company has had to fall back several times. Morale is low. Not that yours was high to begin with. You don\u2019t even know how you\u2019ve survived this long. While you had some battle experience during your time with the mercenary company, it still hasn\u2019t prepared you for the horrors you\u2019ve seen. The undead\u2026you\u2019ll never get used to fighting such emotionless creatures that are the embodiment of death and all that\u2019s unnatural.\n\nYou briefly wonder if your brother Mallack is alright where he\u2019s stationed, but it hardly matters at this point.\n\nBattle comes as it always does and you are not so lucky this time. Horrible and powerful creatures known as Blood Specters and Death Knights utterly destroy your side.\n\nYou fall to undead blades and chilling touches only rise up and join them in their goal of global genocide.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stick with it", "result": "You\u2019re in this now and you can\u2019t stop just because it\u2019s looking tough. You got your family to think about. You\u2019re staying.\n\nHowever you do, do something slightly out of character, you spend what little money you have on a whore for the night, mainly because you\u2019re a lot less sure if you\u2019re going to come back from this mission.\n\nThe next day you\u2019re on the job. The march to the dwarven lands is mostly uneventful, though the fighting between the Zalan Empire and the Tulan Kingdom is still going on their borders which even skirting around, still manages to find your company. The Boss takes advantage of straggling Tulan soldiers that have fled battle. The butchery isn\u2019t uncommon, after all, nobody will know and the Zalan Empire will just be blamed anyway.\n\nArrival in the Dwarven lands is met with caution, the Dwarves obviously know of the Chimera Company\u2019s reputation and a small group of them motion the Boss to just talk to him directly. A deal seems to be made and the Dwarves leave to go back to their underground home.\n\nThe Captain now addresses all of you.\n\n\u201cAlright, apparently there HAVE been demons running all up and down and through the area. The Dwarves are preparing defenses in case they try to invade underground; apparently they consider their underground city takes precedence so their main force is there. However they still have plenty of mines above ground and not nearly enough dwarves to defend them all. Now its been said the demons have been heading toward the Tulan Kingdom, but a lot of them still have been fucking around here and generally wrecking shit for the fun of it. Collapsing even the sturdy mines of the dwarves on their heads seems to be amusing to them. So our goal is to make things bothersome enough for them that they\u2019ll leave the dwarves alone and go elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe Captain spits on the ground before continuing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to split up for this assignment and take different mines in the area. Watch your fucking ass. I don\u2019t think any of you eunuchs have fought any demons before, but I have and they\u2019re utterly fucking ruthless. Forget all that shit about some of them being civilized. They\u2019re about as civilized as damn Quillar, but a lot more intelligent. The chaos that is in their hearts is always there and these ones are the complete embodiment of it. And for fuck\u2019s sake DON\u2019T stay near any explosives! The dwarves are always using shit like that in their mines and demons have a tendency to have fire throwing abilities. It\u2019s probably the reason for all the easy mine collapses.\u201d\n\nThe Captain takes out a map.\n\n\u201cOne more thing. While I know the common thing to do on our assignments is to take advantage of things. We need to play this one completely fucking straight! Do NOT fucking do anything that\u2019s going to piss off the dwarves! If you do, we don\u2019t get paid. We don\u2019t get paid. I\u2019m going to get pissed, because we\u2019re getting a lot for this one. And assuming the dwarves don\u2019t kill you, I certainly fucking will. Alright now I\u2019m going to assign you according to this map.\u201d\n\nYou and a few others (Including Dimitri) are assigned to the Karzac Mines where you make your way to after some climbing which fortunately isn\u2019t too far off ground level. The dwarves there regard you with suspicion immediately.\n\n\u201cOh great they\u2019re here. Alright, let\u2019s set the ground rules. I\u2019m head miner Morri and I\u2019m in charge of this place! Don\u2019t even think about trying to steal some loose bars of silver that you might find lying around. You do it, and your skull meets an axe or mining pick! Got me?\u201d\n\u201cStand up when you speak to me.\u201d Dimitri laughs.\n\u201cYeah, make yer jokes human, we\u2019ll see if the demons will appreciate that humor when you\u2019re meeting them face to face.\u201d\n\u201cDemon, pah! Just one more thing for me to kill, people make a big deal about them. I\u2019ve seen how they fall in line and become law abiding citizens just like anyone else when beaten down.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and those same civilized ones will kill you when they get the chance. Didn\u2019t you hear the Captain?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah well he\u2019s got a tendency to be over dramatic; he probably picked that up from that fine ass elven bitch he\u2019s married to. Besides who DOESN\u2019T try to kill you when they get the chance? They aren\u2019t anything special. Their race just has a tendency to have assholiness come natural to them.\u201d\n\nMorri interrupts the pair of you.\n\n\u201cHey if you two morons are finished, I\u2019m about to tell you the fun part of this job. There are demons already in this mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, bunch of those fuckers as we speak. Seems we got the fortune of one sneaking in here and decided to have her spawn in the deep reaches of this mine. The only good thing is these types don\u2019t seem to be interested in collapsing the mine, however they\u2019re trying to turn this place into some sort of fucking demon hive or something. We\u2019ve been trying to eliminate them, but of course it\u2019s slow going. We need to get them before they start breeding more though. So we\u2019re splitting up\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHere we go again\u2026\u201d Dimitri says.\n\nMorri assigns at least a few dwarves with each mercenary. You, Morri and Dimitri make up the last one.\n\nThe demon hunting in the mines is actually a very \u201cmundane\u201d job. They certainly are horrible looking creatures and very vicious, but after the first few times, you get used to it. These particular demons have an insect like appearance so maybe that\u2019s why these behave the way they do. They aren\u2019t very tough in the scheme of things, but like Morri said there do seem to be a lot. You can\u2019t use your bow like you want to either due to the cramped mine conditions.\n\nDemons aren\u2019t really the problem though, the problem is Dimitri.\n\nAfter one of the harder battles, Morri is attempting to catch his breath. Dimitri notices the very large silver deposit you\u2019re next to and the silver that\u2019s just there for the taking. He quietly whispers to you that you and he should waylay Morri and take some of the silver. Leave his body to be munched on by a wandering demon. Who\u2019s going to know?\n\nYou\u2019re not really for this plan and you say no, but Dimitri begins to argue and Morri notices the both of you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it! The Captain said\u2026\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 pussy!\u201d Dimitri says pushing you.\n\u201cHey hey hey! Not doing what? What are you two on abo\u2026\u201d\n\nDimitri takes the opportunity of distraction and hits Morri in the face with silver bar that he lifted off the ground earlier.\n\n\u201c Ugh! Bastard dog you\u2019ll pay for this treachery!\u201d Morri utters falling to the ground.\n\u201cCome on, this is your last chance to be a man and help me pig farmer!\u201d Dimitri says as he goes to finish off Morri.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Dimitri", "result": "You hate yourself for this, but you feel you don\u2019t have much choice, if Morri lives he\u2019ll certainly tell everyone and then you won\u2019t get paid which will probably result in your death by the hands of the Boss. You raise your own weapon and help kill Morri. He doesn\u2019t die easy, but Dimitri finishes him off before he can put up any sort of meaningful defense.\n\nBreathing hard and smiling at you with blood on his face, Dimitri laughs a bit.\n\n\u201cHeh heh, knew you\u2019d see the light, lute boy! Now come on, let\u2019s throw his body in that left passage. I think I heard some of those demon roaches chittering down that way. Let\u2019s just make sure we\u2019re not around eh? We got a lot of silver to load up on!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t take any of the silver actually, you\u2019re still worrying and not feeling right about this whole situation, of course that just means more for Dimitri.\n\nYou don\u2019t even think this half assed plan of Dimitri\u2019s is going to work. You and Dimitri are going to look mighty suspicious meeting up with the other dwarves without Morri, and trying to conceal a shitload of silver, though Dimitri claims everything will be fine.\n\nEverything goes less fine when you start to realize that Morri was the one who was leading you through this mine maze. Neither you or Dimitri were paying attention to the directions mainly because you were on the look out for demon attacks and fighting them off.\n\nEventually you\u2019re attacked by more of the demons as you proceed to get lost. You and Dimitri get into an argument and begin to blame each other (Though it really is his fault) You both get angry and come to blows, you however get the advantage, not being weighed down by silver. You leave his body for the demons.\n\nYou however don\u2019t get too much further. The demons seem to be coming out in more force and you\u2019re wounded many times. You get scared and confused and you know you\u2019re a dead man when you see Morri\u2019s body being eaten by several of demons. You\u2019ve gone in a complete circle and now you\u2019re hearing that demon chittering from everywhere.\n\nA valiant effort is made by you, but you can\u2019t fight them all.

We warned your captain that if any evidence of treachery occurred, we weren\u2019t paying him shit and this deal was off!\u201d\n\u201cBut can\u2019t we just keep this secret? I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSecret? Fuck no! Look, you\u2019re not a bad person, but you\u2019re hanging out with bad people. The only reason why we hired you in the first place is because you ARE effective and you\u2019re about the only mercenary company insane enough to do a job like this. But a deal\u2019s a deal. You captain apparently doesn\u2019t have control over his men like he thinks, because I\u2019m sure he warned you all.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but everyone will probably blame me and my life will be in danger!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026well\u2026I\u2019m sorry about that, but that\u2019s the price you pay for the company you keep\u2026look I\u2019ll tell you what, because you helped me, I\u2019ll take you back to the entrance and you can leave.

And if he mentions the truth, then your family may well be in danger. You imagine that if the Boss couldn\u2019t get to you, he may very well take it out on your family.\n\nYou feel sick and upset. You wish you hadn\u2019t chosen this path. All you ever really wanted to do was play your lute, not fight demons or anything else really.\n\nYou follow behind Morri in a daze. You\u2019re surprised that he doesn\u2019t insist that you walk in front of him, but then that\u2019s probably because he trusts that you\u2019re not a murderer. You also realize you recognize this part of the mine and could probably find your way back from here\u2026\n\nYou shake your head and take a deep breath.\n\n\u201cHey Morri.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026glagh!\n\nAn arrow goes right through Morri\u2019s mouth and out the other side of his head. He gurgles obscenities while trying to raise his axe towards you. Another arrow goes through his eye. He ceases his struggle.\n\nWhile you solved the problem of Morri telling anyone, now you have to cover your own tracks, then you hear a sound you never thought you\u2019d be glad to hear. The chittering of those insect demons and a bunch of them are coming right behind you.\n\nYou pull the arrows out and run as quickly as you can to the entrance leaving the demons to feed upon Morri\u2019s body. The thought crosses your mind to just leave anyway. Maybe they\u2019d think all three of you got eaten. However, you run into another group during your dash to the mine entrance.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell are you running off to?\u201d a mercenary asks. It\u2019s Cal. You come up with a lie quick.\n\n\u201c(pant) Shit! We got fucking ambushed! (pant) Barely fucking escaped! (pant) Dimitri and Morri are dead! Probably eaten! And the rest of those demon fuckers are heading this way!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You cowardly fucker, you just let Morri die?\u201d one the dwarves says angrily.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea! I tried to help him and Dimitri, but they just came in force, I don\u2019t even know how I escaped!\u201d\n\nYour story is a little suspicious, but thanks to the demons, you\u2019re covered. They didn\u2019t leave much for the dwarves to find. However, you\u2019re not looked favorably on by the rest of the dwarves for the rest of the mission. Your fellow mercenaries don\u2019t really care one way or another. It\u2019s part of the job and Dimitri wasn\u2019t well liked so they could care less if he died or lived.\n\nYou on the other hand are still not feeling so great about yourself. The longer you\u2019re part of this company the more you\u2019re starting to think or be more like them. You hate it and you\u2019ll be glad when this job is over.\n\nA few months pass and the contract is over. The \u201cproblem\u201d isn\u2019t completely gone, in fact there\u2019s reports of some undead wandering in the area now, but the Dwarves are growing more weary of your presence, hand over your payment and tell you to leave. They say they can handle anything else themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a lot this time. Best job you\u2019ve had. Upon your return to the Zalan Empire you buy yourself a new lute. It\u2019s your \u201creward\u201d. The rest of it goes to your family who of course are eager to hear about your tales as usual. You don\u2019t tell them that many this time. You just try to take your mind off your \u201cjob\u201d by asking them more questions this time around. When you\u2019re alone you play your new lute, trying to emulate a couple of the songs you overheard the Dwarves engage in when you were there. You never knew they were musically inclined; it\u2019s a shame you had to kill one to protect your future. You\u2019re still debating on whether or not to give up the mercenary life, but you see how much it\u2019s helping the family out, so you decide to stay and put up with it.\n\nAfter your \u201cbreak is over\u201d you go back to the job as usual.\n\nThree years pass\u2026\n\nFour years have passed since the \u201cNuro Incident\u201d and things have gotten much worse in the world. The Necromancer Lord conquered the Brot Kingdom, A demon lord called Velzix conquered the Tulan Kingdom, both are expanding and a so called Grand Alliance of nations doesn\u2019t seem to be doing much good against either of them.\n\nThe Chimera Company was recently hired by the Zalan government. Due to your past battles with demons, they decided you would be good to put on Tulan Border which is still a bloodbath, but instead of fighting the Tulan Kingdom, the Zalan Empire is fighting Velzix\u2019s hordes.\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy assignment or very pleasant, in fact it\u2019s got to be the worst job you\u2019ve been on. You company is assigned to make commando raids and sabotage shit to keep the demons fairly unfocused, while the Zalan Empire\u2019s real armies try to make progress into Velzix\u2019s realm. Currently you\u2019re making your \u201ccamp\u201d in small abandoned village in enemy territory where you have to fight the occasional demon patrols.\n\nWhy the Captain took this job on for the company is beyond you. Nobody really knows why. The company in general has been taking more dangerous jobs in recent years. Ever since the Nuro Incident actually. While it\u2019s always been known he\u2019s not a man to shy away from danger and has a love of battle, there\u2019s a lot of talk within ranks that he\u2019s got a death wish.\n\nThe only \u201cgood thing\u201d about this assignment, is that the chance for usual Chimera Company wicked acts are much lower. There\u2019s not many \u201cinnocents\u201d in a demon realm.\n\nAs you think about things, strumming your lute in an abandoned general store by yourself. You hear someone speak.\n\n\u201cPretty good playing. Wish my kind appreciated some of the more subtle things in life sometimes.\u201d\n\nYou turn your head and see a demon! He\u2019s not very tall and is \u201cdressed up\u201d. He must be one of the \u201ccivilized\u201d demons who realigned themselves with their demonic natures and flocked to Velzix when he took over the Tulan Kingdom. He doesn\u2019t seem hostile, but you drop your lute and draw your weapon, before you can yell a warning, he speaks again.\n\n\u201cWait! Before you go warning your friends, I should warn you that there is a very large group of my fellow kin surrounding this village. You kill me and they\u2019ll attack and quite frankly I don\u2019t fancy your chances. However I got a deal for you that can be worth your while. What can it hurt to listen to me? You can always kill me afterwards.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Listen to the demon", "result": "You aren\u2019t sure about this, but you let him speak.\n\n\u201cSpeak demon, but make it quick!\u201d you demand.\n\u201cAh, glad you\u2019re willing to be reasonable. Name\u2019s Big Red by the way.\u201d\n\u201cGet on with it!\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Your company and everyone in it is doomed to the infernal planes when they die I\u2019m afraid. You captain\u2019s deeds alone make him one of the most sought after souls in Hell. He used to be much worse before he got married, but ah well; women often make men weak like that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well not me.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, yeah you too. I understand that you\u2019re probably the most moral person in it, but this whole company has been targeted by Hell and Hell gets what it wants.\u201d\n\u201cWell Velzix isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVelzix? I\u2019m not talking about Velzix! Velzix is just another demon with big dick complex. If I trust my judgment he\u2019s not going to last another year in his current status, he\u2019ll probably either be dead by one of you mortals or that little Necromancer. (Sigh) Wish I\u2019d known about him sooner, things could\u2019ve been a lot\u2026different.\u201d\n\nBig Red sees that you\u2019re getting antsy so he gets to the point again.\n\n\u201cAnyway, seeing as you\u2019re all doomed to Hell, I figured it would be nice if I got direct credit for bringing you there. Bringing in evil souls yourself is one of the few things makes Hell all worth it. You get all sorts of perks. However, if I just call in the reinforcements now to have you guys get ripped from limb to limb, I won\u2019t get direct credit. The souls will just be gathered wily nily and then I gotta argue with the fucking collectors and lawyers and all that other shit about who killed who and who gets credit which will probably just result in nobody getting credit and doesn\u2019t help me out at all.\u201d\n\u201cBarring that you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m doomed in any case, I fail to see why I should help you.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why I\u2019m coming to you with a deal. I can see you\u2019re not a bad person, you just serve a bad master, and he\u2019s the one I really want direct credit for. The rest of you are just a bonus and you in particular aren\u2019t even worth that much given your tendency towards good.\u201d\n\u201cSo what is it you want from me exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to take out the sentries and distract your fellows for as long as possible while my boys sneak up on this village and strike with as little resistance as possible. To sweeten this deal, I\u2019ll try to tell my boys to not target you while you try to escape the mayhem. I\u2019m not making any promises though, killing rampages among my kind encourage indiscriminate killing. You\u2019ll be on your own; however it gives you a small chance for survival and by agreeing to this plan it gives me direct credit as the mastermind of this cunning plan. Getting other demons to kill isn\u2019t any kind of feat, but employing a mortal to help is looked upon as more favorable. So do we have a deal?\u201d\n\nBig Red offers his hand\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Make the deal", "result": "It sounds like your only chance for survival, slim though it may be. In some ways you\u2019d like to be out of this company and who are you really betraying? From what you\u2019ve seen the company is little better than the demons. You\u2019re sick of all of this, the fighting, the demons, the company, all of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal, but make a damn good effort for your kin NOT to target me, AND not to go chasing me either!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Sheesh, you\u2019re mistrustful. You just make sure you do your part.\u201d Big Red says and shakes your hand.\n\nYou both exit the abandoned store and you look for where most of your fellows are located. The village square of course. You know there are look outs in each of \u201ccorners\u201d of the village. You sneak about the village like an assassin and ready your bow.\n\nYou take out each sentry in relative silence with your skillful bow shots and drag their bodies into a nearby house. Now nobody will raise an alarm too soon. You then head to the village square and begin interacting with some of them. They find it odd since you\u2019re usually keeping to yourself, but they enjoy your playing so they don\u2019t mind it when you do that.\n\nYour Captain on the other hand comes out from the house he\u2019s set up in and is wondering what all the commotion is. He gets angry.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you idiots doing? We\u2019re fucking deep in demon territory and you\u2019re all making enough noise to attract a damn army of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference does it make? They got patrols that have come across our location before, so they know where we\u2019re at.\u201d You remark.\u201d\n\u201cThe difference is that I want you fuckers to be alert and focused if we get attacked, not getting drunk and dancing to music like some fucking sissy elf!\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you married to an elf?\u201d you say still playing and backing away from the Captain\u2019s reach. He\u2019s almost in shock that you\u2019d speak to him in such manner especially since you never usually speak too much in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou, pig farmer are really pushing my patience tonight. If I didn\u2019t need all the people I can get for this job, I\u2019d kill you myself!\u201d\n\u201cShhh! I think you better shut the fuck up lute boy.\u201d One of the other mercenaries whispers.\n\u201cWhy? We\u2019re already in fucking Hell, who gives a shit how much noise we make?\u201d\n\nYou defiance gets worse and finally the Captain draws his weapon to shut you up. At this point you call him a pile of orc shit and run. This causes the rest of the mercenaries to get out his way as he charges at you. Some of them also give chase, but most just stay out of it.\n\nFortunately at this point the demons have finally gotten into position and strike. Most of the company is so bewildered by what has occurred between you and the Captain that they\u2019re unprepared. Your Captain immediately stops his pursuit of you when a particularly large demon jumps on top of him from one of the rooftops. He fights it off with the help of some of his men, but you see more coming and continue to make your escape.\n\nAs you run away from the village, a few demons pass you by and don\u2019t attack, looks like Big Red kept his word.\n\nTo a point.\n\nBig Red suddenly appears in front of you.\n\n\u201cThanks friend, now for your reward!\u201d he says and then puts his fist through your chest which kills you instantly.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time has passed, but you eventually hear Big Red speaking to you.\n\n\u201cGet up, I need your word.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d you say in a daze.\n\u201cDid I not get you to distract the Chimera Company in an effort to collect all their souls?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Yeah\u2026\u201d you continue to say in a daze.\n\nYou start shaking the cobwebs and see that you\u2019re in a completely different place. A very bad place. Big Red and another much bigger demon are talking. You see the rest of your Company in the distance, naked and in chains. The entire landscape is very barren, has a reddish hue and its uncomfortably hot.\n\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019ll get credit for all these souls.\u201d\n\u201cHang on, I want to keep this one, he has certain talents and he did allow all this to happen.\u201d Big Red says pointing to you.\n\u201cVery well\u2026that\u2019s your right. Just sign there, and there, okay. Let\u2019s load these sorry souls up!\u201d\n\nBig Red looks pleased with himself as the souls are taken away.\n\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m going to take a break.\u201d\n\nYou feel compelled to join him, but you still have questions obviously.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck man?! I\u2019m in Hell!\u201d\n\u201cGot it in one. Excellent detective work.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026But the deal! You broke the fucking deal! I don\u2019t belong here!\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t. I said my fellows wouldn\u2019t harm you, not that I wouldn\u2019t. Besides YOU made a deal with me, which damned you in the first place. You definitely belong here.\u201d\n\nThe reality of this situation has now caused a massive amount of fear within you. You\u2019re in Hell and there\u2019s no escape from it! You can\u2019t even attack Big Red, he\u2019s got a permanent magical hold on you from causing him any sort of harm, though you probably wouldn\u2019t be a match for him anyway. You collapse on the ground and feel defeated. Big Red stops, but he doesn\u2019t get angry.\n\n\u201cNow what is your problem? I just saved YOUR soul from being eternally tormented by my superiors. They\u2019ll probably be eating them and shitting them out only to eat them again for who knows how long. Not a pleasant process.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but what are you going to do to me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re going to play for me at my home in the Blood Hills. Trust me, its not nearly as bloody as the name makes out.\u201d\n\u201cPlay?\u201d\n\u201cSure. I said you played pretty well, and I do appreciate such things. Music is one of my hobbies other than the whole soul collection thing of course. I\u2019ve got sheets of music from lots of places; I can\u2019t play worth a shit though. The claws don\u2019t help either. Now come on let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou are finding this very odd, but you don\u2019t feel as bad now. You\u2019re Big Red\u2019s slave, but given where you\u2019re at, things could be a lot worse. You\u2019ll at least get to do something you\u2019ve always wanted to do. Play music without hindrance. You wonder about your family, but there\u2019s little that you can do for them now. You just hope things work out for them in the living world.\n\nBig Red\u2019s home isn\u2019t some giant castle, but a moderate sized house. The inside is decorated with grisly trophies, which you guess can only be considered demonic art.\n\n\u201cSinthinia! I know you\u2019re here! I can smell your scent!\u201d he calls out.\n\nA sexy female demon comes out of one of the rooms. You can\u2019t help but stare, she barely acknowledges you at all though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you Big Red, so did the deal go down well?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it could\u2019ve gone better, but it was still a good haul. So how is it really going with Velzix?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) He\u2019s probably going to lose as predicted. I can sense it, anyone with half a brain can. That whole world is going to eventually become a graveyard, I know it. And the undead are no fun. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come back here.\u201d\n\u201cWell my house is your house. Let\u2019s put some music on shall we?\u201d Big Red points to you. \u201cYou, go pick up that mandolin over there and start playing that something on those music sheets I got set up. Sit over there and continue playing until I say stop which won\u2019t be anytime soon.\u201d\n\nOnce again you feel the need to comply. You do exactly as Big Red commands as he and Sinthinia head to a bedroom. He then stops to turn to you.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if you realized it at the soul market, but your Captain was NOT there. You know why? Because he somehow managed to fucking escape death! Now I could blame the idiots that were working for me for allowing him to escape, but I figured since I got you anyway, it would be more fun to blame you. Enjoy playing music for all eternity!\u201d he says as Sinthinia giggles and they close the door.\n\nYou don\u2019t quite understand that remark until you begin playing the mandolin. You begin to feel excruciating pain all over. Your mind is tormented with negative emotions causing you great distress as well.\n\nBig Red has made it so your greatest love which is music causes you pain.\n\nAnd you can never stop playing.\n\nAll you can do is suffer.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline the deal", "result": "Fuck this. He\u2019s lying and even if he isn\u2019t, making a deal with a demon is never a good idea. You\u2019ve heard the stories and you\u2019ve seen the former Tulan \u201ccitizens\u201d that debased themselves just in order to live to serve their demon masters. It never ends well.\n\nIf you are going to the infernal realm when you die, you\u2019re still not going to be helping anyone to take you there!\n\n\u201cWell, let me think about it\u2026.HEY THERE\u2019S A FUCKING DEMON ATTACK COMING!\u201d you shout at the top of your lungs. You\u2019re pretty sure at least one person heard you.\n\u201cYou asshole!\u201d Big Red growls and lunges at you which you dodge out of the way and just focus on getting back to where most of your company is making camp, yelling the whole time.\n\nUpon hearing your warning, everyone scrambles for battle. You can hear the demons bellowing in the distance. They\u2019ll be here in force soon. You quickly climb on to the village rooftops and ready your bow as the demon hordes advance all around you.\n\nThe battle wasn\u2019t as hopeless as Big Red made it seem like it would be (He must\u2019ve ran off as there was no sign of him) however, the Company does take more than the usual casualties. One of the mercenaries starts to openly complain.\n\n\u201cThis is just fucking retarded! Why the hell are we doing this shit?\u201d Cal complains.\n\u201cYou know the score; you don\u2019t like it you can leave.\u201d The Captain says calmly cleaning off his sword.\n\u201cYeah and then I don\u2019t get paid, which is when by the way? We\u2019d all like to know when this contract is over! You never did tell us!\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2026indefinitely.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d almost everyone exclaims.\n\u201cLook, would you sissies calm the fuck down? We got a break coming up in a few weeks. We go back to the Zalan Empire to get paid, rest, re-equip and whatever else they got there, but after the break we go right back out here. Possibly even deeper.\u201d\n\nAt this point the whole company is turning against the Captain, he doesn\u2019t look worried though.\n\n\u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kidding me? You\u2019re expecting us to go deeper into this shit? You\u2019re practically asking us to stand in the middle of Hell!\u201d\n\u201cDunno why you\u2019re protesting, we\u2019re all going to the real infernal plane anyway when we die, might as well get used to it. Look, take it or leave it, I don\u2019t give a shit. If you want to stay, go ahead. If you want to leave now, go ahead. If you want to leave after you get your pay, go ahead. But I\u2019m sure you know by now, if you leave don\u2019t come back ever.\u201d The Captain says and goes back to the abandoned home he was staying in.\n\nThis comment by the Captain makes you think back to Big Red\u2019s little speech, you start wondering about your future while everyone begins talking amongst themselves about what to do next. A lot of them are saying the Boss has lost his mind and is being suicidal. You can\u2019t say you disagree. In fact you\u2019re not sure you want part of this anymore. Your family might need the money, but what good are you dead to them?\n\nA few weeks pass and your company makes its way back to the Zalan Empire. You get your payment. Almost feels like you\u2019re in the \u201creal army\u201d given the formal nature of it. After you get your pay, you\u2019re on your way home where you intend to stay, much like many others are planning to do. However, you bump into the Captain who speaks to you. There\u2019s a hint of alcohol on his breath.\n\n\u201cSo can I expect you to stay on lute boy?\u201d he asks bluntly.\n\u201cErm\u2026well, no Captain. I\u2019m sorry, but going deeper into demon territory is suicide.\u201d you reply..\n\u201cProbably right, but who wants to live forever?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019d like to at least live past the next year.\u201d\n\u201cHah! So you wish to die an old man in your bed?\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you take on such a dangerous line of work in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cMy family needed the money.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, you are one of the few in the company that has one. One of the fewer still that actually takes care of them\u2026an honorable pursuit. I can respect that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re surprised to hear the Captain praise anything that seems honorable.\n\n\u201cI have a family that I take care of too you know.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know you are married.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026but my daughter is a captain in the Zalan army. She\u2019s stationed on the Tulan border as a matter of fact. She might even get transferred to the Grand Alliance army. Don\u2019t know yet.\u201d He says with a hint of pride in his voice, though he tries his best to conceal it.\n\nThe Captain is just full of surprises. You now know that this isn\u2019t some simple death wish, but that he\u2019s taken the job to help her out in a way. You don\u2019t know, but can only imagine what growing up with a dad like him was like. You unsure of how to reply so you just follow up with something.\n\n\u201cUm, that\u2019s great Captain.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great. Got a son too\u2026he\u2019s\u2026a wizard. He\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 disappointment\u2026 y\u2019know you look back on your life and you wonder what you\u2019ve accomplished and it doesn\u2019t mean shit in the scheme of things, at least not when the world has one foot in Hell and the other in the grave. But still you struggle and fight right? You still remain true to your nature.\u201d\n\u201cSure I guess so.\u201d You say wondering where the Captain going with this.\n\nThe Captain sighs heavily.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m lucky\u2026killing and battle are in my nature. I get to do it every fuckin\u2019 day and it never seems to be enough, even after all the years and changes\u2026 but I bet you didn\u2019t want this shit right? You probably wanted to just play that fuckin\u2019 lute of yours right? You got a gift and its being wasted due to events out of your control\u2026but you still play that thing when you can. It\u2019s in your nature. It\u2019s also in your nature to help out your family because you care about them.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, nature\u2026it\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 bitch.\u201d\n\nThe Captain now looks directly at you.\n\n\u201cLook I\u2019m not gonna beg ya, but you\u2019re one of the best men I got in the damn company, and I\u2019d rather not lose you, so I\u2019ll appeal to your nature. What\u2019s going on in the world today is some fucked up shit. Quite honestly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well for any of us, but you struggle and fight anyway. The financial aid that you\u2019re providing for your family pales in comparison to what you\u2019re doing in the long term. You\u2019re making the world safer for them so that they might be able to live. We got the Gates of Hell on one side and Death\u2019s Door on the other and both of them need to be fucking closed. I don\u2019t know if that makes us the so called good guys now, but all I know is if there\u2019s an active way I can protect my wife and even help my daughter then I\u2019m gonna do it. What are you going to do?\u201d\n\nThe Captain then leaves you without saying another word.\n\nSome pretty deep words for a man who you never saw as compassionate in anyway. He does make a point though. Lately what has been going in the world is pretty bad and you wonder if not fighting today will just mean putting off fighting tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay in the company", "result": "You might be a fool, but the possibility that the Captain knows what the fuck he\u2019s talking about can\u2019t be ruled out. If killing demons now is going to make life a little safer for your family in the future, then you probably should be apart of that. Same with the undead if it comes to that, though you\u2019re hoping that you don\u2019t need to. Fighting demons is bad enough, you haven\u2019t even fought any undead and the stories that your dad told you and that you\u2019ve overheard others tell still makes you dread the day that you\u2019ll actually have to.\n\nFor now though you\u2019re going home to spend time with your family and tell them all how much you love them.\n\nOne year passes\u2026\n\nFive years since the Nuro Incident and you\u2019re deep in the heart of Velzix\u2019s Realm. Guerrilla hit and run tactics and sabotage have greatly angered Velzix causing him to divert forces where he might use elsewhere. You\u2019ve even managed to sneak into his fortress a few times to sabotage his goals of creating a permanent open portal to the Infernal Planes. Something nobody wants except the demons.\n\nIt\u2019s odd, but the Chimera Company has been turned from an example of \u201cthugs for hire\u201d to \u201cHeroic warriors\u201d by the Zalan government, but then the Zalan Empire has always been a bit heavy on propaganda. The fact that the company is directly working for it, makes any politician that was remotely involved with the idea of hiring you in the first place to milk it for all its worth.\n\nThe real truth however is what\u2019s currently of the company is made up of the suicidal, desperate or the insane. You\u2019re not sure which one you are at this point, but in the eyes of the public, you\u2019re a hero. (Surprisingly Cal is still there for all his past complaining)\n\nThe Captain has been telling tales of his past life a lot more lately when sitting around the campfire. He talks about the people he\u2019s killed, the women he\u2019s raped, and the treasures he\u2019s plundered. Most of the stories you\u2019ve only heard about in rumor from others in your Company, but hearing them come from the Captain himself makes him sound even more rotten. You\u2019re sure glad you didn\u2019t know him back in the \u201cold days\u201d. He doesn\u2019t seem to show any remorse, though he doesn\u2019t really talk about it gloriously either. He just tells them as a story to pass the time between fighting, much like you do with playing your lute.\n\nEvery now and then he tells you to play something specific. Some elven song that you\u2019ve never heard before, though apparently he really wants you to play it since he gives you a crumpled piece of sheet music containing its notes.\n\nIt\u2019s a not a complex song for an Elven one, but it still takes you a few weeks to learn it completely. It would probably take you less time, but there\u2019s the demon fighting that sort of gets in the way of practice.\n\nThe first time you play it, the Captain, closes his eyes and begins to smile. You think that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever seen him do that. Others in the Company are amazed as well.\n\nWith his eyes still closed he begins to speak of his family and how beautiful his wife is and how when he first met her it was love at first sight.\n\nHe then speaks of his daughter, and how proud he is of her. Her battle skills have gotten her a captain\u2019s position in Grand Alliance army. He hopes that she has many victorious battles and kills all those that stand before her without mercy.\n\nHe is silent for awhile as you play\u2026then he speaks of his son is much harsher tone.\n\n\u201cA disappointment\u2026a fucking disappointment. Fucked up somewhere\u2026wasn\u2019t hard enough on him. Now look at this shit we\u2019re in\u2026demons, undead\u2026fuck it. If I\u2019m bound for the Infernal Plane for bringing destruction to the world then I\u2019m gonna give those bastard demons a good reason for torturing the shit outta me when I get there. Namely by killing a shitload of them and fucking up their plans as much as possible. Just hope my necromancer spawn is eventually there right beside me getting tortured as well.\u201d\n\nYou temporarily stop playing at this outburst by the Captain. Others in the Company are looking and whispering to each other. Did he just allude to what you think he did?\n\n\u201cWhat he fuck are you doin\u2019? I didn\u2019t say stop playing!\u201d\n\nYou quickly return to playing and nothing more is spoken of it. As it happens the song is one of the last things you play. Your lute is destroyed in a battle a couple days later. You curse as one of the few things that took your mind off this shitty place is gone. You just hope you live long enough to buy a new one.\n\nA few more weeks pass and what wasn\u2019t spoken of, makes an appearance\u2026\n\nTwo of the lookouts run back to the main camp one day and rush into the Captain\u2019s tent. You can hear them babbling something about son, and death and doomed. You then hear him yelling at them to shut the fuck up and speak clearly. The rest of the Company starts to pick up there weapons as if expecting something to go down and you follow suit and that\u2019s when you look in the direction where the sentries ran from and see a lone hooded figure.\n\nNone of you don\u2019t know how to react. Every instinct in everyone is telling them to attack, but the aura of power and fear he\u2019s giving off is very strong. Almost paralyzing.\n\nJust then the Captain comes out of his tent and speaks.\n\n\u201cBoy, you gotta a lot of balls showing up here before me. Didn\u2019t think you had \u2018em either. Figured you\u2019d be hiding in some tower somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well sometimes you have to do things yourself.\u201d\n\nWeird.

Wait you dumbfuck\u2026\u201d the Captain yells trying to stop you.\n\nYou arrow flies straight towards the Necromancer Lord, but it doesn\u2019t even reach him, a magical shield causes it to bounce off harmlessly.

You begin looking for your best route of escape and slowly start backing away.\n\nThe Captain on the other hand speaks directly to his son. He doesn\u2019t even show any fear. They speak for a moment and things get very tense, you\u2019re about ready to run, but things take a sudden turn for the very strange.\n\nThe Necromancer Lord has proposed a temporary alliance to assassinate Velzix. The Captain is hesitant about this at first, but an agreement is made on payment and he accepts.\n\nThe Captain then informs all of you in more detail of what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAlright men, we\u2019re gonna go storm the Gates of Hell and close those fuckers for good. My\u2026son there is going to provide magical support. He\u2019s also going to be providing a shitload of money for this job. The stipulation is we can\u2019t tell ANYBODY about this shit. I\u2019m fucking serious. Word gets out that we were working with the fucking Necromancer Lord, we\u2019ll all be hanged, regardless of so called heroic deeds of killing demons. We\u2019re all in this together and there ain\u2019t no backing out, because this deal is made. And if you think you\u2019re gonna step out on me now, that ain\u2019t in the plan. I\u2019ll just kill you and have my son raise your undead ass to help us anyway!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You just decided this for us?\u201d Cal exclaims.\n\u201cYeah? What of it? I\u2019ve ALWAYS made all the decisions for your dumb ass! It\u2019s why YOU\u2019RE still working for me, because it\u2019s lucrative! This ain\u2019t gonna be any different. Plus we get to take fucking credit for killing a damn demon lord. Think of all the pussy you\u2019ll get from that fucking fame eh? Now stop bitching and let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re enthusiastic about this, but it would appear you have little choice in the matter.\n\nAs you travel to Velzix\u2019s fortress you overhear some of the conversations the Captain is having with his son. A strained relationship to be sure. They make a lot of cutting barbs to each other, each criticizing the other for various things. It\u2019s obvious that they can\u2019t stand each other, but are a lot more alike than either one wants to admit.\n\nIt makes you glad when you encounter the occasional demon skirmish on the way, since it at least it decreases the tension and possibility that the Captain\u2019s son is going to finally lose his temper and kill everyone due to his father\u2019s words. Eventually you arrive without any more problems. You enter Velzix\u2019s fortress through the secret way that was discovered long ago.\n\n\u201cDumb ass demons, we\u2019ve been using this entrance for like a year now and they still haven\u2019t caught on!\u201d the Captain remarks to his son.\n\nYou make good progress in the fortress and then\u2026\n\n\u201cThere they are, just like Velzix said they would be!\u201d a demon guard shouts.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t caught on yet huh?\u201d the Necromancer Lord says, looking at the Captain.\n\u201cQuit yer bitchin\u2019 and start doin that death magic thing!\u201d\n\nYou proceed to do battle with the demon and mortal guards that attempt to stop you. The Necromancer Lord starts to raise the mortal guards after they\u2019re killed, but it begins to unnerve you though when the Necromancer Lord starts raising your own fallen dead.\n\nPretty soon it\u2019s just the Necromancer Lord, the Captain, you, Cal and a bunch of corpses fighting off what seems to be an endless supply of Hell\u2019s own. You begin to wonder if Velzix already got that portal working.\n\nAs you get closer to Velzix\u2019s inner sanctum even the undead troops are being decimated at an alarming rate. You\u2019ve been wounded several times and extremely tired. You don\u2019t want to think about any of this, even in the heat of battle you start to take your mind elsewhere with a tune inside your head.\n\n\u201cFuck man! We\u2019re gonna die here!\u201d Cal screams as he attempts to fight a horned demon which has obviously got the advantage over him. You feel a demon blade in your back causing you to fall to the floor. At this point nothing but music fills your mind; bloodshed and battle surround your prone body.\n\n\u201cFuckers are without end! Come on! Raise these fuckers and let\u2019s go!\u201d you hear the Captain yell followed by \u201cHah, no lying down on the job anymore Cal!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not quite dead yet though, and the Necromancer Lord and his dad aren\u2019t waiting around so they continue on quickly leaving you behind.\n\nAs your life force ebbs and more demon guards run past your body, you don\u2019t know if what you did was worth it or even the right thing. All you know is you did what you could and hope your actions may have made some sort of difference and increased the chances of your family\u2019s future well being.\n\nYou then smile. You\u2019ll see them again someday.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026I believe that\u2026\u201d you allow yourself to think as you die.\n\nBig Red was wrong about your fate.
