I\u2019m surprised she only paddled you and didn\u2019t have you kicked out of the school permanently.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well it didn\u2019t even hurt. My dad beats me harder than that. Though I guess Tom thought it hurt with the way he cried! Hahahaha!\u201d David taunts.\n\n\u201cShut up David!\u201d Tom exclaims.\n\n\u201cSo are you playing Smash Sphere over in the park today?\u201d David asks you.\n\n\u201cI hope so, but my dad\u2019s been on my case about me studying harder. Says he wants me to make something of myself when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sucks. My dad is always either at the mines or drinking at your dad\u2019s place. The only time I have to worry about him is when my mom tells him about something I did, then I get a beating. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d survive it if he was always around.\u201d David replies.\n\n\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t beat me, but she\u2019ll yell and throw me into a small dark closet without food if I do something bad.\u201d Tom says.\n\n\u201cYour mom is one scary ass dyke, Tom. My dad said he saw her scare away a mountain troll in the mines once.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up David! My mom\u2019s not a dyke!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes she is! What about that other lady that lives with you then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just mom\u2019s roommate! She needs a place to stay so she helps around the house, like cook dinner or clean up. Mom is at the mines all day, so she can\u2019t do that stuff, so it works out. She\u2019s kind of like a live in maid!\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds more like a second mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nAs much as you enjoy Tom\u2019s na\u00efve defense of his lesbian mother and David\u2019s taunting of it, you arrive at the Inn where you say goodbye to your friends and tell them you might see them later.\n\n\n\nAs soon as you get in, you dad calls you over to the bar.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo do you have any homework?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not due until next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, well if it\u2019s not due until next week it must need a lot of attention, better get started on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not that much dad, I can do it over the weekend. I\u2019m going to go out and play smash sphere with David and Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that what you think? Better cancel that idea. You\u2019re hitting the books, besides I vaguely remember you mentioning you were also going to have test next week too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut dad!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dad me! You\u2019ve been letting your school work slide lately and getting into trouble at school with those two little hoodlums you hang out with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not hoodlums, and I didn\u2019t get into trouble today!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be getting into trouble in the first place! Look son, I know you think I\u2019m being hard on you, but this really is for your own good. Your little friends don\u2019t have fathers that give shit about them, I should know because David\u2019s dad is in here all the time and as for Tom, well the less said about his situation the better.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re getting out of here today, but you make one last attempt.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I really don\u2019t have that much homework, I really can do it quick over the weekend!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if that is the case, you can help me out here instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my barmaids is sick and I\u2019m expecting a full house here tonight due to it being one of the miner\u2019s birthdays today, so you can carry food and drinks.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou certainly weren\u2019t expecting that.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t mom do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is going to have her hands full attempting to cook the giant cloudspeak ram in the kitchen for the celebration, in fact you can start off by helping her chop up the beast.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs usual your dad has given you no \"choice\" at all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Resign yourself to doing your homework", "result": "Well, you\u2019d rather not do any real work and lying and sneaking out is probably just going to get you into more trouble.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do my homework!\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cGood choice son. Make sure you lock the door to the private quarters as usual.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou head upstairs to the third floor where your family has their own living space and lock the door.\n\n\n\nYou get started on your homework to get it out of the way so you\u2019ll at least have the weekend to enjoy. As you go through it, it\u2019s a little more difficult than you thought it would be and it was probably good that you have given yourself a lot of time to work on it.\n\n\n\nA few hours pass and you\u2019re finally finished. Your dad might be right; if you\u2019d paid more attention in class your homework wouldn\u2019t have taken as long. It\u2019s too late now to go out and play even if you were allowed, but that still doesn\u2019t mean you have to do anymore studying tonight.\n\n\n\nYou spend the rest of the night playing with some of your toy soldiers and reading a few of your copper dreadfuls. You sometimes can hear some of the louder drunk miners using a bunch of curse words in an amusing way. Eventually you fall asleep.\n\n\n\nThe next day you wake up early, your parents are still asleep so you grab some cookies before you go out to play. You run into Quincy on the way to David\u2019s house.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, where were you yesterday? You missed all the excitement!\u201d Quincy says.\n\n\u201cYeah, I had to go my homework. Damn, I knew I was going to miss a good game of smash ball!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not that! David and Tom got arrested!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! After we played a few games, we all went to the sweet shop. Well David and Tom tried to steal some of the candy and when Mr. Blek saw them, they ran off with it! They didn\u2019t get far though. From what I know they spent the night in Juvie Hall!\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is surreal to you. Your dad was right again. You wonder if you would\u2019ve went along with them and gotten in trouble as well if you\u2019d snuck out yesterday. You can always say now that you wouldn\u2019t have, but who knows at that moment?\n\n\n\nOne thing is for sure; you\u2019re not going to hang out with those two on a regular basis anymore.\n\n\n\nYears pass\u2026\n\n\n\nThe day is finally here and you\u2019re heading off to Klyton University. All your hard work has finally paid off and your parents couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow remember, I\u2019ve been saving for your tuition since you were born, but remember why you\u2019re there. To learn! I don\u2019t want you getting caught up in wild parties and failing your classes. Maybe the upper class kids with super rich parents can afford to, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind your father, have some fun when you can. We know you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor the most part you do, accomplish the right things in your days at Klyton University. You study, you make contacts, you make friends, and in your free time you have fun.\n\n\n\nYou initially thought you might be \u201clooked down on\u201d due to your working class background. While there are a few like you here, a university education is still expensive and generally only the rich can afford to send their children there. Still, you managed to get here, you (and your family) must have earned it, and so you\u2019re treated with respect.\n\n\n\nYour years at Klyton University are busy but happy ones. You can only imagine that when you just started you pre-med courses that more of the same would\u2019ve come about, however that\u2019s not to be\u2026\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re in your dorm when you get the message from a courier.\n\n\n\nYour father has died of a heart attack. Happened suddenly last night while he was working and by the time a physician arrived nothing could be done to save him. You sit down in shock for a brief moment and when you finally gather your strength, you catch the next coach to the Miner\u2019s Mug Inn.\n\n\n\nWhen you arrive the Inn is closed, so you let yourself in to find your mother who is unsurprisingly upset. You console her as best you can for the time being and help make the funeral arrangements.\n\n\n\nYour father didn\u2019t want an expensive funeral, so it\u2019s a small one. The Inn\u2019s staff is invited along with a few of the miners that were genuinely friends with your dad. Everyone pays their respects before dear old dad is put into the ground.\n\n\n\nOn your way home with your mother, you suddenly realize you\u2019ve missed a couple classes during all this. You then start to wonder about your future college plans and while it\u2019s still a fragile time for your mother, you need to ask her about it when you get home.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know it yet, but you\u2019re in for more shocking news\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "The long talk", "result": " \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re selling the inn?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to! I can\u2019t run this place myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what you have staff for!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh son\u2026(sniff) I don\u2019t think you know the entire situation. You haven\u2019t been around as much over the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I always meant to visit more, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. In fact I\u2019m glad you had fun at college. You at least had some enjoyment. I\u2019m just sorry you won\u2019t get to have any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t like where this is going.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou mom at this point begins cry again until you eventually get her to calm down. What comes next almost makes you cry though.\n\n\n\nWhile your father did indeed save for you, it wasn\u2019t enough to put you through college completely. Costs were higher than he thought and even though business was okay, he had unexpected expenses such as making fixes to the inn and price hikes in his alcohol supplier.\n\n\n\nYour father was determined to not pull you out of college though, so he found another way. He borrowed money from a moneylender.\n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT?! Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I could\u2019ve taken less classes or gotten a part time job at the university!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t want you to worry or get distracted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s good since all that worry can go to this now! By the gods, why didn\u2019t he at least go to a bank to get the loan!?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried, but didn\u2019t get approved. They wouldn\u2019t even take the inn as collateral. I pleaded with him not to borrow money from criminals, but he claimed it would be fine as long as he opened the tavern earlier, found a cheaper supplier and made a few cuts here and there. And for a while things were running a little smoother, but I could see the stress taking a toll on him. It\u2019s what ultimately killed him. I\u2019m just so sorry that we failed you. We wanted so much better for you. Now I\u2019ll have to sell the inn off to pay off the moneylender and hopefully I\u2019ll be able to find a job as a cook elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou just sit in silence and try to wrap your head around all of this. Your bright future in medicine as you know is gone. You still have quite a bit of education, and you\u2019re fairly certain you could still find a job to support yourself, but it\u2019s going to be hard initially and you probably won\u2019t be satisfied with it. You\u2019re also worried about your mom, what if she can\u2019t find a job? You won\u2019t be able to help her much.\n\n\n\nYou can only think of one solution.\n\n\n\n\u201cWould it help if I ran the inn?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d your mother replies.\n\n\u201cWould it help if I helped you run this place. I mean granted I don\u2019t have excessive experience, I have watched you guys do it while I grew up here. I think I can manage the basics. If we managed to keep this place running at least long enough to pay off the loan, maybe then I can save enough to finish my education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know son, I mean\u2026I would love to see you finish your education, but it\u2019s a lot to take on. Would you have time? I don\u2019t want you getting burned out and suffering a pre-mature heart attack like your father because of the stress!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to have nothing but time now, if I drop out and focus on this place. I think the main concern is getting us out of debt\u2026just how much do you owe?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026about ten thousand gold coins.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou really hoped it would be significantly less than that.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m guessing he takes smaller payments to buy you time but then charges more interest with each passage of time. We\u2019ll have to get this place whipped into shape so it\u2019s making enough profit that we\u2019ll be able to pay the entire sum as soon as possible. After that, we\u2019ll have some breathing room.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour mom looks apprehensive about all this and then shakes her head claiming she can\u2019t let you shoulder this responsibility especially with the risk of physical danger involved if you anger the moneylender in some way.\n\n\n\nShe says that you should go on with your life and forget about the inn, she\u2019ll be able to sell it and pay off the debt with no problem. And as for her, she also tells you not to worry about her either, but she hopes that you\u2019ll forgive her and your father for failing in giving you the life you deserve.\n\n\n\nIt is true you could walk away from all this. You don\u2019t really have any great desire to run the inn. It was just a solution you came up with to help your mom and possibly help yourself. But there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s going to work, just like there\u2019s no guarantee that you can\u2019t still achieve your goals on your own.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take over the inn", "result": "You shake your head; you can\u2019t walk away from this. Your mom might be in serious trouble because this loan. Selling the inn might not even be enough to cover it and even if it is, she probably won\u2019t have enough to fall back on.\n\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t angry with her, but you do feel a little anger towards your dad for getting her in this position (and you indirectly). You realize he still had the best intentions for you, but those don\u2019t really help right now.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright first things first, who is the name of this loanshark?\u201d you ask your mother.\n\n\u201cMr. Reynolds. He\u2019ll be coming next week to pick up a collection. He\u2019s not a member of the Crimson Talons, but he does have a couple of their goons working for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Crimson Talons? Oh geez, this just get better\u2026okay how is this place doing for business?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing about as well as it always has.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be enough, we\u2019ll need to get more people in here, or cut costs somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell your father was going to have more work done on the rooms in the hopes that it would keep adventurers and maybe even merchants to come back whenever they travel through here. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it though. Adventures don\u2019t care where they sleep half the time and it\u2019s not always a sure thing that they\u2019re going to live long enough for repeat business. As for merchants, I think this place is a little too blue collar for them most of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said something about getting a new liquor supplier?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the one here raised their prices, it would actually be cheaper to get the stuff shipped in from Hessla. Your father was supposed to meet with the new potential distributor in a couple days, so I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going to go through, if at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the staff?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff is working on minimum wage as it is, we\u2019ve got three barmaids, Rita, Eliza and Wendy and they\u2019re all disgruntled about their jobs, but they all still work well.. We can barely pay them though, and we might have to fire one of them.\n\n\n\nGrim stuff, but you\u2019re determined to see this through. Since the liquor supplier from Hessla won\u2019t arrive in two days you\u2019re just going to focus on what you can do now.\n\n\n\nFixing the rooms is still a good idea to keep potential returning wandering adventurers happy. Spending a little money now could increase potential profits later. Who knows, maybe even a merchant will show up and spread the word that this place isn\u2019t just some place where miners get drunk.\n\n\n\nFiring people sounds like it might save you money, but all it\u2019s really going to do is create more work for the rest of you, so you decide to hold off on firing anyone for now.\n\n\n\nYour mother doesn\u2019t agree with your idea of fixing the rooms, but seems relieved that you\u2019re not firing anyone.\n\n\n\nThings go as normal at the inn. Several of the miners still offer their condolences about your father and are surprised to see that you\u2019re taking up his mantle as it were, but other than that they don\u2019t say to much to you. They probably don\u2019t know what to say since while some of them might know you since you were little, but you\u2019re not really \u201cone of them\u201d in terms of education level. Not to say they\u2019re all a bunch of grunting idiots, but they probably figure you\u2019re used to talking about things of a more cerebral nature. You don\u2019t mind though, after all your main concern is getting your mom out of debt.\n\n\n\nTwo days pass and the supplier from Hessla arrives. He\u2019s a grungy shady looking individual, but considering he\u2019s from Hessla that\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\n\n\nHe immediately says his name is Calwin asks for your father at which point you tell him he died recently. Calwin shows no sympathy and merely complains that he\u2019s made a trip up here for no reason. You show a little restraint and call your mother to speak with him, but after five minutes with him she\u2019s ready to throw him out the door for hitting on her, and you\u2019re not exactly thrilled with him either at this point.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook folks, if you want good quality alcohol at a low price I\u2019m willing to deal wit ya, but I\u2019m gonna need some incentive for my troubles because y\u2019all seem like a buncha uptight prigs. Now I was invited here by the man who ran this establishment, so you called me here, if my help ain\u2019t wanted, I\u2019ll be on my way\u2026\u201d Calwin says.\n\n\n\nWhile you\u2019re tempted to just have him leave, you decide it would be best to at least see if his stuff is any good.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright prove it. Surely you\u2019ve brought some of your alcohol here so we can test to see if it\u2019s any good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I do have some with me, but I can\u2019t just be givin\u2019 this stuff away for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be compensated.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou call attention to the miners in the room and ask them if they\u2019d like to try some new beer, naturally they\u2019re all for it. A few of the miners take their fill of Calwin\u2019s beer and they say that it\u2019s different from what they usually drink, but it\u2019s just as good.\n\n\n\nCalwin looks a little put off that they claimed his alcohol is \u201cjust as good\u201d, but still maintains that it\u2019s better than what you already have. He states his price, and also mentions that he wants a free room whenever he comes here since he\u2019s apparently got a harpy of a wife at home and he likes to stay away for a couple days before having to go back to Hessla.\n\n\n\nYour mother obviously isn\u2019t thrilled with having to deal with him, and in the short time he\u2019s been here; he\u2019s also hit on every one of the barmaids. Granted they\u2019re used to such behavior, he\u2019s particularly revolting. (Plus he\u2019s from Hessla)", "action_results": [{"action": "Deal with him and agree to the free room", "result": "If it\u2019s only for a couple days, what can it hurt and you\u2019re getting a good deal on his alcohol, so you figure it\u2019s a good idea. This does not go well with your mother who says you\u2019re going to get the pair of you further into debt. It takes some time, but eventually you manage to convince her that the money you\u2019re saving will be worth the couple days out of the month that he actually comes up here.\n\n\nMeanwhile Calwin calls his lackeys to unload his cart and take the stuff down to your cellar. Calwin then states he\u2019s going to retire to his room and that if any of your barmaids want to join him his door will be open.\n\n\n\nThe next couple days aren\u2019t exactly pleasant, Calwin is a complete lecherous slob and leaves not only his room a disgusting mess, but hangs around the bar all day trying to grope the barmaids. (Rita in particular) You have to warn him several times to leave them alone, and eventually one of the miners who has a crush on Rita punches him in the face resulting in a minor scuffle in which Calwin is not the winner.\n\n\n\nYou fully expect Calwin to claim that he\u2019s never dealing with you again, but as it turns out he doesn\u2019t think anything of it. Indeed he claims if it had been a bar in Hessla he probably would\u2019ve gotten a knife in the eye instead, so he considers himself lucky. Eventually he leaves and everyone is glad, but there\u2019s the sickening feeling that you know you\u2019re going to have to put up with him a few times every month.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week you haven\u2019t saved any money. In fact you\u2019ve barely broke even.\n\n\n\nWhile you\u2019re sweeping up the inn early morning, a non-descript man of medium height enters with two bigger figures. One of them is unmistakably an ogre while the other guy is just a tall muscular human. Either one could break you in half.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you are Mr. Reynolds?\u201d you ask, knowing that it has to be him.\n\n\u201cThat would be me. I take it you\u2019re the son of my late debtor? I do hope you realize that the debt doesn\u2019t end with him dying\u2026\u201d Mr. Reynolds says\n\n\u201cNo, no of course not. I\u2019ve got some of what my father owed.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou hand over the most you can under the circumstances, but Mr. Reynolds looks insulted.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy boy do you take me for an asshole? Your father used to pay me much more than this pittance!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a rough week\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t give a shit about your excuses, you\u2019ve chosen to take on your father\u2019s debt so you are expected to fucking pay up like he did! (Sigh) Look, since you\u2019re obviously new to this, I\u2019ll let you off with a warning. Olaf.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuddenly the ogre steps forward with a smile and punches you the stomach. You temporarily lose the ability to breath and collapse on the floor. When you finally do catch your breath, you promptly vomit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was my warning, let\u2019s hope I don\u2019t need to do it again. Be seeing you again in a few weeks kid. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Mr. Reynolds leaves, your mother comes running up from the cellar wondering what\u2019s going on. She helps you up when she sees you.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh no son I can\u2019t let this go on. We\u2019re selling the inn right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no mom, it\u2019s alright, you\u2019ll see. We\u2019re going to make this place profitable and payback the loan and after that we\u2019ll be able to take the next step.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon, I love you, but you\u2019ve made a lot of questionable decisions as far as business is concerned. I mean if this keeps up, I\u2019m stepping in before this place goes to hell so I can actually make money selling it to the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get enough for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll get enough to pay off the debt, and if worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll leave Klyton and live with my sister in Teckleville\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t live with aunt Enora, you always said she\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is, but that still doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t help me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve still got time, I know my ideas are going to help us out soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I hope all your fancy schooling you gained some sort of insight that I\u2019m not privy to. Alright we\u2019ll give it until the next time Mr. Reynolds comes around for payment.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou agree and start wiping up the floor before customers come in.\n\n\n\nThe next few days are uneventful; the miners seem to be enjoying the new Hessla ale though so that\u2019s a relief. They even seem to be talking to you a little more, one in particular Ular has been chewing your ear quite frequently. He\u2019s the one that has an obvious crush on Rita, but you\u2019ve never seen him actually talk to her on any serious level. Strange that a big tough miner would be too shy to speak to a girl, but there it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo how long have you known Rita?\u201d Ular asks.\n\n\u201cMe? Well she started working here just before I left for college so I didn\u2019t speak to her too much back then, and I haven\u2019t really spoken to her too much other than about duties around the inn since I\u2019ve got back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, you know? I always wonder if she isn\u2019t a Delantium Princess hiding out or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a pretty girl.\u201d You reply.\n\n\u201cCan you speak to her for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust speak to her for me. I try, but I\u2026dunno I don\u2019t have the words! I get all tongue tied an\u2019 shit. I mean you\u2019re a smart guy, you went to college an\u2019 shit. Maybe you can tell her better how I feel than I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno if should get involved in this\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease man, just do it\u2026oh shit here she comes!\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point Ular stumbles over his own feet trying to get to a dark corner before Rita arrives for more ale. Feeling a little sorry for the guy, you talk to Rita.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Rita, this is going to be strange question, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh gods, you\u2019re not going to start hitting on me too are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Uh no! But well, there\u2019s a miner named Ular who\u2019s sort of nuts about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s nuts over me like every other miner here trying to get under my skirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t think so, he\u2019s so damn shy he\u2019s practically afraid to speak to you, and surely you\u2019ve noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I suppose I have. I will admit he\u2019s a little different than the rest of these ale swilling pigs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo are you interested in him?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh\u2026I dunno. I mean from what I know of him he seems respectful and he did punch out that fucker Calwin when he groped me, but that\u2019s not really enough. I need a man that\u2019s going places. I mean he\u2019s a miner; where\u2019s that going to lead me? Not in fine Selkie furs and a big house, I\u2019ll just be barefoot and pregnant and still living here.\u201d\n\n\n\nSame old Rita. Still, you can certainly understand her desire to move up in the world. However, a miner still makes a decent living. A lot better than her that\u2019s for sure.

Ular seems like a cool guy and probably should know the type of girl she is anyway.\n\n\n\nAs Rita walks off, you look for Ular and see him slowly coming out of his dark corner. You explain to him how the conversation went, he\u2019s obviously upset about it, but thanks you nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s true about that old saying. You can\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Give everyone a round for the house on me, everyone else might as well be happy even if I\u2019m not. Just don\u2019t have Rita serve my drinks anymore okay?\u201d You understand and carry on with your duties.\n\n\n\nThe remaining days until the next payment go as normal and Mr. Reynolds is satisfied with the payment he receives, and you still have a little saved over. You have hope that in time you\u2019ll get out of this debt eventually.\n\n\n\nHowever, trouble rears its ugly head when Calwin shows up on his monthly delivery. He says that he\u2019s decided to bump the price up on his alcohol. You furiously ask why, and he says that the last time he was here he noticed how nice the rooms were and that if you can afford to fix them up, you must be able to afford to pay him more for his product.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need to be said that your mother does not want to deal with him at all at this point.", "action_results": [{"action": "Comply with his demands", "result": " \n\nHe\u2019s got you over a barrel, you agree to his price.

This time she quits when Calwin practically molests her when she takes food up to his room.\n\n\n\nDeal or not, your mother isn\u2019t going to put up with his shit any longer, grabs your dad\u2019s Troll Gun from behind the bar and kicks him out of his room.

Maybe you\u2019re just being impatient, but after all the problems and headaches you\u2019ve encountered you really don\u2019t feel like dealing with this job anymore, especially not when there is potential danger constantly looming overhead.

Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn\u2019t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren\u2019t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can\u2019t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville, which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it\u2019s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn\u2019t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn\u2019t anywhere in the field that you would\u2019ve liked. You\u2019re a clerk in tax office, filing away items, straightening out reports and such. You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you look back and wonder where you exactly went wrong with the inn and how you could\u2019ve done things differently.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll never know.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Use the still", "result": "You\u2019re willing to stick it out a little longer, but you really need to use a few short cuts now. The brew from the still is good enough for the miners and you won\u2019t have to deal with a middleman anymore.\n\n\n\nYour mother isn\u2019t happy with this idea. She wasn\u2019t thrilled with it before, but realized it was necessary at the time. You argue with her for hours about the moral and legal ramifications of it all until she finally gets tired and capitulates under stress.\n\n\n\nOver the months you manage to save tons of money, are able to pay Mr. Reynolds off larger amounts and you believe in a few more months you\u2019ll completely be free of him.\n\n\n\nThe problem now is with your mother who still insists on bitching at you day in day out despite the fact that you\u2019re basically saving her ass from the problems that her and your dumb ass dad got you involved into in the first place.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, will get off my fucking back? I\u2019ve been the main one coming up with solutions on how to save this fucking place and I\u2019m getting shit for it? Why the hell am I getting punished for something you and dad did? I was supposed to be taking classes right now to become a doctor! Y\u2019know, like YOU all wanted me to? I\u2019m trying to make the best of this situation and still find a damn way of achieving my goals yet all I\u2019m getting is kicked in the fucking face for it!\u201d you yell while throwing a potato against the wall.\n\n\n\nYour mother shakes her head.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to you, but the son I knew wouldn\u2019t be engaging in criminal activities and yelling at me like this. This isn\u2019t worth it; I\u2019m not dealing with this anymore. You want to be mad at me and your father, you can go right ahead, you might even be right in some way but I\u2019m still not going to put up with it. You think you can turn this place around and still achieve your goals? Go right ahead, but you\u2019re doing it without my help. I quit, and I\u2019m handing this place over to you. Have fun, and I hope you make all your dreams come true.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re a little shocked by this. You run after her asking what she\u2019s going to do and that you\u2019re sorry about the stuff you said, but she won\u2019t hear it. She just says she\u2019s leaving the deed with you and she\u2019s going to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville.\n\n\n\nAfter some last words are exchanged she\u2019s gone. You aren\u2019t quite sure how to feel and you\u2019re still trying to wrap your head around it when your barmaids come in.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey which one of you is the best cook?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, I guess that would be me.\u201d Wendy says.\n\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re upgrade to cook, you\u2019ll get a small raise too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, mom quit and gave me this place, so we\u2019re making some changes around here.\u201d\n\n\n\nWendy looks a little pleased with getting a small promotion, but Rita isn\u2019t so happy.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey what about us? You can\u2019t just expect us to shoulder all the extra work! You\u2019re going to have to hire someone else to help!\u201d Rita says\n\n\u201cSettle down Rita, I\u2019ll be getting some new help soon don\u2019t worry about it. All I need from the rest of you is to do your jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few weeks pass and you\u2019re doing okay even if you\u2019re getting some grumbles from your staff every once in awhile. You do end up hiring a new person, but it\u2019s not another barmaid. It\u2019s a janitor so the barmaids don\u2019t need to worry about cleaning up as much anymore. The great thing is he\u2019s simple minded and you don\u2019t need to pay him since apparently his mother wanted him out of the house and dragged him by the ear to you when she saw your Help Wanted sign. You agreed to let him sleep in your cellar and he could eat all the rats he catches down there. (Though Eliza gives him real food from time to time)\n\n\n\nYour still is perfected a bit better, but the brew from that stuff does take it\u2019s toll on your usual patrons. While none of the miners go blind, a lot of them are starting to feel several side effects from drinking the stuff on a regular basis. This causes some to stop coming in altogether, but on the \u201cplus side\u201d you do get a few more lowly types that don\u2019t give a shit what poison they put into their system. You end up changing the name of the place to the Bottomless Mug Inn.\n\n\n\nDespite your decrease in clientele you still manage to cut enough corners and exploit enough drunks that you pay off Mr. Reynolds. He\u2019s a little surprised considering how run down the inn has gotten. He suspects (quite rightly) that you\u2019re probably doing something illegal and tells you if you ever need another loan in the future you know where to find him. You vow that you\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n\n\n\nWell the inn is profitable again (barely) and you\u2019ve effectively saved the place and your mother from potential danger (mainly yourself) but taking over your father\u2019s inn wasn\u2019t your dream and it wasn\u2019t your parents\u2019 dream either.\n\n\n\nYou figure you\u2019ve got two choices, you could either sell this place now and hope you get enough money for it to finish your education, or you could continue to run it as a ongoing source of income and somehow manage to save enough as well as find the time to study while running this dump.", "action_results": [{"action": "Sell the inn", "result": "You can\u2019t stand running this increasingly run down piss hole anymore; you\u2019re selling the place.

That\u2019s when you get the idea to improvise.\n\n\n\nLearning the lesson in cutting corners at the inn, you enroll back at Klyton University and set up a small lab like you did with the still but this time you decide to make drugs instead. Cloud rock is easy to make and you figure you\u2019ll be able to support yourself and if you get a part time job on campus, you should be able to swing it. The inn money will help you in the beginning months while you get settled.\n\n\n\nThings initially go good for you, just like you thought, but when the inn money runs out that\u2019s when crunch time starts and you\u2019re not quite as prepared for it as you thought.\n\n\n\nClasses get increasingly harder, which means you need to study a lot more, combining that with your two jobs is rough and eventually you\u2019re not getting enough rest and one of them has to go. Not surprisingly you quit your regular job as the university\u2019s bookstore assistant since it pays less and you figure you can easily make up the money just by selling more drugs which you\u2019ve become frighteningly good at.\n\n\n\nAfter one more semester, you figure why bother with college at all? You could just sell Cloud Rock all day make as much money as a low level physician might and not bother with studying, because really what has this college business gotten you?

Elves have terrible work ethics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already told them what to do, but I figured you\u2019d be keeping an eye on them most of the time, so you can make sure if they\u2019re working and not goofing off\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?! As if I don\u2019t have enough to do around here? Look, I\u2019ll do what I can, but really between the cooking and other shit I do, you expect me to play mother hen to them you\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a raise if that\u2019s what you\u2019re angling for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, I wouldn\u2019t dream of being that optimistic, but quite simply I\u2019m stretched thin as it is, I can\u2019t do it all and I think you know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you\u2019re right, well I guess Eliza will have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHER?

You think you can replace me with those little half-breed sluts I saw you with earlier? Yeah right! I\u2019m outta here!\u201d Rita says and makes a dramatic exit by shouting to the various patrons of how they should take a good look at her ass as she walks out the door, because it\u2019ll be the last time they see it around the inn.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my!\u201d Eliza exclaims.\n\n\u201cWhatever. Okay, now I have to talk to you too\u2026and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not firing you.\u201d You say before Eliza jumps to that conclusion.\n\n\n\nYou explain to Eliza that it\u2019ll be part of her job to train the new girls. She\u2019s surprised and nervous as you\u2019d expect, but you try to reassure her that she\u2019ll be fine.\n\n\n\nInitially things are shaky. Eliza isn\u2019t very authoritative and often Wendy or you have to step in to lay down more discipline in the half elven sisters. A couple more months pass and it\u2019s obvious things are not working out. Sunshine and Flameflower work, but in a very half-assed way. Even Rita did her job. The sisters are prone to flirt a lot to the patrons, which is good\u2026but not so great when they tend to disappear with said patrons for a few hours. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you were running a brothel and making money on this, but you aren\u2019t and it\u2019s too late to start now.\n\n\n\nYou get angry with Eliza and tell her that she needs to get a leash on them, but all this does is make Eliza more nervous and cry that you\u2019re yelling at her. You try to get Wendy to help more, but she complains about how she told you in advance that she can\u2019t do anymore than what she\u2019s doing now. Ultimately she quits because she\u2019s getting burned out. This is soon followed by Eliza who is so stressed out that she can\u2019t take it anymore. As for Flameflower and Sunshine, you don\u2019t even bother firing them since they just stop coming in one day.\n\n\n\nAt this point your school work is taking a small dive due to your only source of income crumbling. You see the writing on the wall and decide to sell the place hoping that you can finish up at least the year. You aren\u2019t going to be able to become a doctor, but MAYBE you\u2019ll be able to get a good job with your education level. You feel slightly bad about Alan who you have to run off because he doesn\u2019t completely understand why he has to leave.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get quite as much money as you\u2019d like for the inn, mainly because the place had gone down hill quite a bit during the time your father ran it, but you finish out the year.\n\n\n\nAs for getting a job, you manage to get one, but it\u2019s working as an office clerk in the city. Maintaining records, filling out shit, etc. It\u2019s tediously dull work, but to a certain extent you\u2019re just glad to not have to worry about that damn inn anymore.\n\n\n\nOver the years, you settle into your mundane life. You\u2019re always a little bitter about your situation, but you try to make the best of it. It isn\u2019t a terrible life, but you always wonder what you could\u2019ve done differently.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll never know.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Cut back on food and promote Wendy", "result": "Again, the inn isn\u2019t really like how it used to be where you\u2019d get miners coming in wanting some food with their ale.

Things are nice for a little while, but as usual a problem crops up to make you life a lot more difficult.\n\n\n\nWendy\u2019s kids are little monsters. Not to you, but to just about everyone else. Wendy tries to keep them in line through screaming and beatings, but it doesn\u2019t work for long.\n\n\n\nHer youngest Carl is a dirty little boy who is constantly trying to look up Eliza and Rita\u2019s dresses or touch them in some inappropriate way. If he can\u2019t get to them, the local trashy women who frequent the bar will do. Most of the time he tries to play it off like he doesn\u2019t mean anything, but he knows damn well what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\n\nWendy\u2019s daughter Annie is obviously taking after her with the same grasp of verbal swears. She swears so much you initially thought she had Rosette\u2019s Syndrome. Her mouth wouldn\u2019t really be a problem except she\u2019s loud and is always asking the inn guests strange questions (swearing the whole time of course).\n\n\n\nFinally her oldest son, Henry is well on his way to be a future sociopath. The kid will sit in a corner watching everything and everyone with this creepy look like he\u2019d murder everyone if he could. You\u2019ve noticed that knives from the kitchen have been going missing and you never used to come across so many bloody cat heads in the alley before Wendy moved in. While you can\u2019t prove the animal killing or knife theft, you know for a fact that he\u2019s been fucking with Alan. For the past week you\u2019ve noticed Alan limping, when you questioned him, he stated it was nothing, but on closer inspection you saw that his shoe was in a burned condition and he had a bruise on his neck. You question it further and Alan finally breaks down and tells you it was Wendy\u2019s son, but states that Wendy\u2019s son was just \u201cplaying\u201d that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and he didn\u2019t want him getting into trouble.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the last straw for you. You and Wendy need to have another talk about this arrangement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy I need to talk to you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan it wait\u2026HEY GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE BASTARD!\u201d Wendy says shouting at one her little demons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we need to talk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha\u2026oh fine.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou and Wendy step into the kitchen and you waste no time in expressing your concerns.\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy you\u2019ve been a great help her since you moved in, but it was my understanding that you were going to have your kids under better control than you have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey this is the best all of them have been in ages!

I\u2019m your boss and I\u2019m telling you need to get your kids in line! Alan just told me that your oldest son snuck down into basement and gave him a hotfoot while he was sleeping. When Alan predictably woke up, he nearly choked himself because your little psycho set up a wire noose around his neck tied to the table nearby.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you believed Alan?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlan\u2019s a lot of things, but he\u2019s not a liar. If anything I had to drag the info out of him. He was afraid of getting your son in trouble, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was just afraid of your son period.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Even if it is true. So what? That\u2019s just how boys play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how future murderers play. Look, I\u2019m not arguing with you anymore. Your kids are a problem and you said they wouldn\u2019t be. So get your shit together or face the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you, you gonna fire me? Pfft! Yeah right. Without me, you couldn\u2019t run this place and pursue your precious education at the same time. Hell, I doubt if you could run it period.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Keep trying to reason with her", "result": "You can\u2019t afford to fire her and you don\u2019t even want to risk threatening her with it lest she call your bluff and leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cWill you listen to yourself for one moment?

If you won\u2019t do it for me, at least do it for your own self-preservation!\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re threatening to fire me again. If you\u2019re going to do it, do it and stop beating around the fucking fairy bush shithead!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou shake your head at Wendy\u2019s insults. It\u2019s obvious she isn\u2019t going to listen to reason this way, so you try another tactic.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to fire you, but you\u2019re going to have to find another place to live.

You do have a point. I know they\u2019re little monsters. Look I\u2019ll talk to them, I\u2019ll get them in line.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you see it my way, but the time for that has passed.

But hey, if I manage to get my kids to behave within that time can we stay?\u201d Wendy asks hopefully, which is odd to you considering how she was just behaving. You\u2019ve never seen her act in such a desperate fashion before.

Carl\u2019s not grabbing Rita\u2019s ass, Annie\u2019s not cussing out the adventurers and Henry\u2026well he\u2019s still creepy, but he isn\u2019t setting any of your employees on fire and you haven\u2019t tripped over any new cat heads in the alley.\n\n\n\nBy the last week it actually looks like Wendy has succeeded.

If there\u2019s a relapse, it\u2019s back to finding a new place again.\u201d\n\n\n\nWendy of course tells you that she has everything under control with her kids now. Unfortunately after a month you find that she doesn\u2019t. Even worse, she isn\u2019t the only person looking for a new place.\n\n\n\nApparently Henry couldn\u2019t contain himself any longer and one night decided to finish what he started with poor Alan by setting more than just his foot on fire. Alan\u2019s flailing soon set portions of the basement on fire, and your stills just make things explosively worse.\n\n\n\nThe first explosion wakes you up immediately.

She quickly gets over it though.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, whatever. Since we\u2019re done here, I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d She says pushing you aside.\n\n\n\nA week passes and Wendy has already found a new place and moved out. You half expect her to also quit since you know she\u2019s still pissed at you, but she doesn\u2019t. Perhaps she might know this is for the best even if she isn\u2019t going to let you know about it.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime you\u2019re worried more about your future schooling.

You figure if you can pass the remainder of your classes this year, you should be able to get a job working as an intern at the hospital while you finish your medical schooling. While that won\u2019t pay that well, you can sell the inn and live off that for quite awhile especially if you get a cheap apartment, maybe even a roommate.\n\n\n\nAll great plans, but it would help if you could get the backing from one of your professors. It\u2019s possible that one of them could really help you out if you explained your situation. You can think of two that might help you.\n\n\n\nYou advanced microbiology teacher, professor Gossey has always been a friendly sort and you know for a fact that she hasn\u2019t had a problem helping out her students in the past.\n\n\n\nYour advanced anatomy & physiology teacher, professor Kovas isn\u2019t as friendly, but he\u2019s always made a point of praising the work you turn in.", "action_results": [{"action": "Professor Gossey", "result": " \n\nAfter her class you approach Dr. Gossey about your situation, she of course is sympathetic.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I understand. It must be hard for you, running a business like that and attending school, let alone paying for it all. I\u2019m not exactly sure how I can help though, I have hired all the student assistants I need and I doubt if you would have the time for it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there something I could help with, I dunno like an experimental project I could participate in or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha! No, I\u2019m not Dr. Kovas\u2026but now that I\u2019m thinking about it I may have something. You are aware that my other specialty is zoology right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know, you\u2019ve even discovered some new species in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh back when I was younger and more adventurous. Nowadays I tend to hire adventurers to explore for me to find strange and new beasts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, you don\u2019t want me to go seeking new creatures do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, again you wouldn\u2019t have the time and you could get killed without the right equipment and proper training for such a thing. However, you do own that inn of yours do you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I own it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, now I\u2019m going to let you know something that few other do and you must swear that you will NOT mention this to anyone else on campus especially staff!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI have funded an expedition to the Sotakan swamps south of here. Naturally this was incredibly dangerous for several reasons, but most of which is the capture of the elusive daquala. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the stories of the beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s more legendary than anything. Don\u2019t the Sotakans revere it as the living embodiment of one of their gods?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that, anyway the university wasn\u2019t too keen on this expedition and refused to help, so I had to use my own funds. I\u2019ve gotten word that the adventurers I hired have succeeded in their quest, but I just need some place to keep the beast for awhile before I can clear everything with the university like potentially dangerous wildlife, rogue funding, ignoring safety measures, and the rest of usual red tape shit. Your inn would be a good safe place to keep it I think and I\u2019d certainly pay you well for your trouble, plus you\u2019d make money on the adventurers I hired who will stay there.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis information is a little overwhelming and you have several questions.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, first of all how dangerous is this creature? I mean how do you know they got it? I thought it was more of a scary myth than anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they got it, because after I received a message from the adventurers that they had succeeded, I took a trip last week just outside the Elven-Sotakan warzone to see it for myself and the creature in question fits all the common descriptions of a daquala, as well as some of the more fantastic descriptions. The only reason why I didn\u2019t bring it with me is because I\u2019m trying to keep this as quiet as possible and I can\u2019t be seen with this creature until I clear it with the university first. Plus I knew I was going to have to figure out a way to indirectly bribe the Klyton Milita not to ask any questions when this group brings the beast through. As for how dangerous the daquala is, well apparently it killed one of them, but if you\u2019re worried that this is some hulking monster, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about the size of a small dog. It isn\u2019t even that noisy and spends most of its time camouflaged and sleeping. The adventurers I hired will still be looking after it while they stay at the inn, so you shouldn\u2019t worry at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis all still sounds a bit dangerous to you, but after asking exactly how much money Dr. Gossey is going to offer you for this task, you really can\u2019t refuse. You agree and Dr. Gossey thanks you and gives you the names and descriptions of the adventurers who will be arriving to your inn in a few days.\n\n\n\nYou spend the time in between preparing your best rooms and keeping them unoccupied in preparation for the adventurers. This causes a few questions from your staff who notice you\u2019re turning people away from staying here, but you just tell them that you\u2019ve got some special guests coming who are going to be spending a lot more money.\n\n\n\nEventually one of the adventurers arrives. He\u2019s a wiry man with a goatee and wearing leather armor with a couple of flintlock pistols strapped to his sides.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou must be Hanon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you must be the inn keeper. I trust you have our rooms ready?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, four of you right?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo actually, used to be six at one time, but more loot for the rest of us I suppose. I\u2019m guessing you have a cellar where we can keep the beast?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a cellar, but I was told you\u2019d be keeping with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, we\u2019re not spending anymore time with that fucking thing! It might not live up to the legends, but it\u2019s dangerous enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re more than a little worried now.\n\n\n\n\u201cUh\u2026should I even be keeping it here?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not, but I\u2019m guessing that Gossey\u2019s paying a lot so you\u2019re willing to risk it. (Sigh) Look, we\u2019ve got the creature locked up in a mithril cage with three spell wards on it, it\u2019s not going anywhere, but we\u2019re just sick of damn thing and all the trouble we\u2019ve had to go through to capture it ALIVE. The little bastard seems calmer in the darkness, so I figure your cellar will be a good place to keep it while we wait. I\u2019ll check on it twice a day, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is all starting to sound a little more complicated, but again you don\u2019t have much choice. You\u2019re going to have to get Alan out of the cellar though and you\u2019ll have to make sure none of the girls get any drinks from there.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, I guess bring it on in then, go around the back though, it\u2019ll attract less attention.\u201d\n\n\n\nHanon nods and heads outside, and you quickly go get Alan to explain to him that you need him to sleep in one of the rooms you originally set aside for the adventurers. He doesn\u2019t quite understand why, but he obeys your orders to not go into the cellar for a while.\n\n\n\nYou open up the backdoor and see Hanon and a very large man carrying a cage with a black cloth over it. He must be Benjamin. After a walk short walk, you pick an unused part of the cellar to place the daquala. No sounds have come from the cage at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it alive?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s alive, it just sleeps a lot. Good thing too, because it\u2019s quite vicious when awake. I\u2019ll have to feed it in a few hours though\u2026hey I see you got your own brewery here.\u201d Hanon says looking over at your stills. You didn\u2019t even think about that when you brought them down here.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah, that\u2026uh I trust you won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBah, if we\u2019re keeping this daquala situation quiet, you certainly don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Okay I think Ben and I are heading up to our rooms, it\u2019s been a damn long trip and actually sleeping in a bed instead of the fucking wilderness for once will make a nice change.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Hanon and Benjamin head up to their rooms you immediately call the rest of your staff to tell them to not go into the cellar for awhile and if they need to refill the alcohol, you\u2019ll do it. While this creates less work for them, they\u2019re getting curious about what is going on. After all they\u2019re seeing adventurers come out of the cellar, Wendy already noticed the cage being brought into the back of the inn, and the various other changes you\u2019ve been making lately.\n\n\n\nAt this point you figure there might be fewer potential complications if they know what\u2019s going on, so you explain everything.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s fucking wonderful. You\u2019re using this place as a zoo for dangerous animals now?\u201d Rita says.\n\n\u201cShhhh! Keep your fucking voice down!\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cHow dangerous is this thing? I mean could it get out? I heard stories about the daquala when I was a little girl and they still scare me to this day!\u201d Eliza mentions.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t get out. Precautions have been taken. Trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sure hope so, because if that thing gets out and attacks one of us\u2026well I don\u2019t think I need to mention how much shit you\u2019ll be in. Did you tell Alan to get the hell out of the cellar yet?\u201d Wendy says.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019ll be staying in one of the rooms upstairs and I told him to not go into the cellar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm well I guess I\u2019m glad you threw me out of this place when you did, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d live here with a killer monster in the cellar. Still, you\u2019re putting us all in potential danger so I\u2019d say that entitles us to some hazard pay doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! What Wendy said! Hazard pay!\u201d Rita agrees.\n\n\n\nYou almost wish that they\u2019d just refuse to work at all, but you just sigh heavily and come to a fair agreement on \u201cdanger\u201d pay while the daquala is at the inn. You just hope it isn\u2019t too long of a stay since that money that Dr. Gossey is paying you is supposed to go to finishing up your tuition.\n\n\n\nThe next few days go by relatively uneventfully and it\u2019s business as usual. Hanon checks on the daquala periodically to feed and sedate it somehow. You wonder how he\u2019s doing it and he says with magic of course. You have to say that by his look you didn\u2019t think he was a wizard. He and Benjamin spend a fair amount of money in the tavern so it sort of offsets the danger pay you have to give your staff. Everyone stays away from the cellar, except Alan who forgot he wasn\u2019t supposed to go down there, but fortunately Eliza stops him before he got down the stairs.\n\n\n\nAfter a week goes by you ask Dr. Gossey when she\u2019s going to take the thing, but she says she\u2019s still working on the university faculty, as compensation for your patience she gives half of your money now. That\u2019s great and all, but your concern is more of a safety issue now. The magical meat or whatever hell Hanon has been feeding the daquala isn\u2019t keeping it appeased anymore and it\u2019s been more \u201cvocal\u201d lately. Hanon\u2019s also been keeping the magical wards on it for about a month now, and he\u2019s feeling tired all the time now due to the constant drain.\n\n\n\nAnother couple of days and Hanon\u2019s ready to dump the daquala on Dr. Gossey\u2019s doorstep and be done with it. He says he and Ben have gone way beyond what they were paid to do. You sympathize and you want the daquala gone as much as everyone else, but you\u2019re concerned that if he does this, it\u2019s going to fuck up things between you and your professor, not to mention the rest of your money.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let Hanon go to the university", "result": "You don\u2019t think you could stop him if you tried, but you do try to minimize the damage by insisting on going with him and trying to talk to your professor first.

The daquala is growling loud enough for people to know Benjamin is carrying something alive in the covered cage, but fortunately you get to Dr. Gossey\u2019s lab without incident. She of course is surprised to see the three of you.\n\n\n\n\u201cUh hello, I wasn\u2019t expecting to see you three\u2026 wait did you bring the daquala with you?!\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn straight! We\u2019ve completed your task for you and then some!

Look surely there\u2019s a good strong container to hold this thing in here at the university and I\u2019m pretty sure it can just be fed any sort of meat. Can\u2019t it be held here for now? Just keep it here in your private lab until you clear things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO! If anyone found out I\u2019d be ruined! I\u2019ve risked everything to get the beast, and I won\u2019t lose it all by keeping it on campus because of stupid rules! Now get it out of here now!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve never known professor Gossey to be so irrational, but she\u2019s going into overkill with this daquala business. You don\u2019t really understand why she can\u2019t keep it here. It would probably be better anyway since she could study it while she tries to do whatever \u201cred tape clearing\u201d she says she needs to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright fuck this stupid shit, Ben drop the cage over there, we\u2019re getting out of here\u2026but we\u2019re also getting our money. I suggest you pay up, before things get ugly.\u201d Hanon warns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not paying you anything else! I told you when the job is done I will and not before! What? What will you do, kill me? You\u2019d never get away with it and I assure you I am not as defenseless as you might think! And as for YOU, if you don\u2019t stop siding with these glorified mercs you won\u2019t only not get the rest of your money, but you also won\u2019t be passing your class!\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a couple more threats back and forth, and you trying to make peace between your professor and the adventurers, Hanon pulls out one of his pistols, Benjamin draws his axe and Dr. Gossey runs to a panel nearby which slams a adamantium shutter on the lab door sealing everyone in, she then produces a vial with a stopper on top.\n\n\n\n\u201cHold it right there! One more move and I fill this place with the black pox plague!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh fuck! Come on everyone stop fighting!\u201d you say backing away from everyone and looking for someway of getting out of the lab.\n\n\u201cYeah right! Like you\u2019d infect yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cFool! Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve take the antidote already?\u201d\n\n\u201cBitch we just spent a month in the Sotakan swamps getting bit, stung and exposed to several diseases they probably don\u2019t even have names for yet. I\u2019m pretty sure my magic can cure black pox!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell let\u2019s find out then!\u201d Dr. Gossey says and shatters the vial to the floor!\n\n\n\nYou can only look on in horror and sink to the floor in hopelessness. You don\u2019t even pay attention to the events that happen next.\n\n\n\nBenjamin chases Dr. Gossey around the lab with his axe and while he\u2019s doing that, Hanon casts some sort of spell. Of course with Hanon no longer bothering with up keeping the spell wards on the cage, the daquala manages to finally bust out of its imprisonment due to ravenous hunger.\n\n\n\nThe daquala leaps on Hanon and tears into his neck releasing an arterial spray all over the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Benjamin bellows and charges at the darquala who jumps away from eating Hanon\u2019s body and camouflages itself. It doesn\u2019t help it much though, the lab isn\u2019t like the dark expansive swamp and Ben is a big man with a big axe, he just starts chopping at everything and sure enough he eventually manages to graze the creature.\n\n\n\nThe daquala and Benjamin engage in a short battle, but ultimately Ben proves to be stronger and better armored. He manages to grab it in mid leap, throws it to the floor, stomps on its body with one of his heavy boots and finally brings his axe down on its head, killing it for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck, I told you bastards to just wait a little while! Now look what you\u2019ve done! Eat lead asshole!\u201d Dr. Gossey yells and shoots Benjamin in the head twice. He teeters a moment and then falls in a heap near the darquala.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019re still rocking back and forth and babbling about how all you wanted to be was a doctor and how you\u2019re going to die.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about black pox, you needn\u2019t be, there wasn\u2019t anything in the damn vial. I\u2019m not crazy enough to release a plague. Now I\u2019m sure Hanon and Ben coming here was probably out of your hands and you were just trying to play diplomat, but I suggest if you still want to be that doctor you always wanted to be, then you need to do what I say right now\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Gossey orders you to help her clean up this mess. The corpse of the daquala is placed in a new container. She says she can probably present a dead one without as many problems. She really was hoping for a live one though.\n\n\n\nYou ask her about the bodies of the adventurers, and she tells you grab that axe and start chopping them up. She then opens up another panel, presses a few buttons to reveal a secret passage. She enters the passage and comes back out with a big dumpster on wheels.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you hack them into small enough pieces, put them into this dumpster and feed the wazia in the next room. Don\u2019t worry he\u2019s quite tame; just make sure you throw the parts at him from a safe distance.\n\n\n\nYou snap out of your shock. A wazia? Those huge things live in the Cloudspeak Mountains and they\u2019ve been known to even prey on trolls and small manticores! You\u2019re almost about to question Dr. Gossey about how she got one of those things, but you stop yourself. The why\u2019s and how\u2019s aren\u2019t even important right now, what matters is getting out of this mess.\n\n\n\nAfter stopping yourself from vomiting several times during your dismemberment of Ben and Hanon, you proceed to nervously feed the wazia, which isn\u2019t even chained up. You half expect it to gobble you up in one gulp or even Dr. Gossey shutting you in, neither happens. You toss limbs near the beast and it eats a few, and ignores the rest. You presume it will eat them later and you get the hell out of there.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou see why I couldn\u2019t have yet another illegal creature on campus? I\u2019m already running a risk with that wazia. If you think what happened here was bad, you should\u2019ve seen what happened when the adventurers I hired were demanding payment for that thing! Speaking of which I suppose I should pay you the rest of your money. Sorry about the threats before. It was sort of a tense moment you know. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou just nod and don\u2019t argue. It\u2019s unspoken that you won\u2019t be saying anything to anyone about this. What could you say anyway? After Dr. Gossey gives you some new lab clothes to change into, you head home exhausted.\n\n\n\nThe next day you don\u2019t even bother going to class, you sleep in late and spend a majority of the afternoon sitting in your room thinking about some of the shit you\u2019ve done to achieve your goals. Serving homemade alcohol without a license seems to be the least of your crimes now.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I just did what I had to do. It\u2019s all for a good cause, I\u2019m just trying to better myself.\u201d You say and try to wipe your concerns about the morality of it all. You then head downstairs to the surprise of Wendy who figured you were at school.\n\n\n\n\u201cStayed home today eh? How come you didn\u2019t come down when I opened this place up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, okay then. I know you left with those two adventurers and that monster last night. I\u2019m guessing that business is settled then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s all settled.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrue words in many ways. You have enough money to continue your education and with this financial pressure off, you easily pass the rest of your classes with no worries. You later sell off the inn (Which pisses off Rita and Wendy who now have to find new jobs, Eliza and Alan are a bit upset as well), get a cheap apartment near the campus and given your close relationship with Dr. Gossey you get a good job working at the hospital while you complete medical school. It isn\u2019t easy of course, but given what you\u2019ve already been through you\u2019re able to handle it.\n\n\n\nEventually you do fulfill your goals of becoming a doctor. You don\u2019t stay in Klyton though. You have too many bad memories and reminders of \u201cbad things\u201d going on there in general. So you move to the Delantium Kingdom, specifically a border city called Sivak, which has great demand for doctors at their new hospital. The rest of your life is a relatively good one.\n\n\n\nStill, you do have your bouts of guilt every now and then with some of your choices that got you to where you are, sometimes wondering if you could\u2019ve handled a few things better at the inn.\n\n\n\nWho can say, but in any case your days as an innkeeper are long over.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Talk him out of it", "result": "You can\u2019t let him fuck this up for you, Dr. Gossey just needs a little more time. You rush to talk to Hanon.\n\n\n\n\u201cOutta my way, me and Ben are getting that monster!\u201d Hanon says pushing you aside.\n\n\u201cNo! No! Hold on! Wait! Just give her more time!\u201d\n\n\u201cMore time? I\u2019m getting fucking exhausted up keeping the wards! Not to mention it\u2019s getting more and more agitated in that cage. Also we\u2019ve been spending most of our money here, if this keeps up we\u2019re going to be broke!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay how about for the remainder of your stay here, everything is free for you and Ben? That should certainly take the stress off shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, free huh? (Sigh) Alright, you\u2019ve bought yourself some more time and ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 how much, but YOU better go talk to your teacher and tell her she needs to get her shit together soon or I will be coming to drop this fucker on her doorstep!\u201d\n\n\n\nHanon and his buddy at this point proceed to the bar to indulge in their free booze.\n\n\n\nA few more days pass and Hanon and Ben are getting drunk every night. Didn\u2019t used to be a problem before mainly because they were holding back due to funds, but now with free reign they\u2019re becoming the lives of the party on a regular basis. In addition to drinking they\u2019re picking fights with your other paying customers which results in broken furniture.\n\n\n\nCombine this with the higher wages you have to pay your staff and you\u2019re hemorrhaging money. You see Dr. Gossey everyday about taking the daquala, but she just says the same thing all the time \u201cstill clearing through the red tape.\u201d It\u2019s getting really old, and you begin to get pissed at her, to which her response is if you want to a career in medicine you\u2019ll do what the hell you\u2019re told and shut up about it.\n\n\n\nYou head back to the inn cursing the fact you ever asked her for help.\n\n\n\n\u201cHEY ITS DA (HIC!) INNKEEPER! GO MAKE YERSELF USEFUL FOR ONCE AND GET US NOTHER DRINK! HAR HAR HAR!\u201d Benjamin bellows as you enter the inn. Seems that he and Hanon are getting an early start.\n\n\n\nYou storm over to the bar and begin ranting at your staff which is doing nothing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy why the fuck are all of you standing around not doing your fucking jobs?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they drank all the fucking booze and you told us to not go downstairs to get refill casks. Not that we\u2019d go down there in the first place, you don\u2019t give us nearly enough danger pay for that.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou grumble and swear as you head down the cellar steps.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking deserve this shit! I was supposed to be finishing up medical school by now, not cleaning up shit around this place! Thanks a lot dad! You ever think when you started borrowing from a fucking loan shark? Fucking\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou cut your rant short when you suddenly hear a low growl. At first you figure it\u2019s just the daquala again and you\u2019re right except he\u2019s not in his cage anymore. Ever since the free booze policy Hanon\u2019s been taking advantage of, he\u2019s also been getting lax in checking on the daquala. The constant alcoholic haze hasn\u2019t really been helping on his concentration for keeping up the wards on the cage either. All of which contributed to the daquala finally breaking out of his confinement.\n\n\n\nStill thinking it\u2019s still in its cage, you go get a cask of booze. You\u2019ve barely managed to pick one up and you feel a sharp pain in your leg. You fall to the floor, dropping the cask and yelling for help when you see the amount of blood leaking from the sizable hole in your leg.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the last thing you do, before the daquala\u2019s next attack is on your throat.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Professor Kovas", "result": "Given that Dr. Kovas rarely compliments anyone, he has to like you a lot. You decide it might be best to take advantage of that fact. After his class you approach him about your situation, but he doesn\u2019t seem very sympathetic.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m sure your problems are very important to you, but my question is why are you telling me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what I was getting at, I wanted to know if there was something I could do to help you out. Some way of maybe earning more money\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney? Hah! What do you think this is a factory employment line? If you want to help me, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it for cash m\u2019boy. You should be doing it for the love of science!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe starts to make his way out of the classroom, but you follow.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Kovas, I\u2019d love to help for the love of science, but I\u2019m not exactly in a position to do so! I mean I\u2019ve got so many expenses and responsibilities and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop right there m\u2019boy. Again you\u2019re telling me these things as if I can do something about them\u2026or that I WANT to do something about them.\u201d\n\n\u201c(sputter)\u2026because I thought that given how much you praise my work in class you\u2019d want to help out a potential fellow future doctor.\u201d You say getting exasperated.\n\n\u201cYOU? A fellow doctor? Ha ha ha ha! Granted you may have the ability to be a doctor one day, but if you think you\u2019d ever approach someone of my caliber, I\u2019ve sorely underestimated your capacity for logical thinking.\u201d Dr. Kovas laughs.\n\n\n\nAt this point you\u2019re angry, you came to get help, not be insulted by this asshole. You\u2019re hesitant to outright insult him back though since you still need to finish his class, so you just decide to leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright fine, don\u2019t help me then. I just thought you were different from the other rich elitist bastards that look their noses down at me just because of my working class background. I\u2019ll just leave\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, wait, you think I\u2019m looking down on you because of your humble roots? My, my someone has an inferiority complex. M\u2019boy I\u2019m looking down on you because you\u2019re whining about your problems to me. You have much potential and despite your pathetic tales of woe it is obvious that you\u2019ve overcome much and are determined in your goals to become a doctor. I think however you could do something more, but unless you\u2019re willing to help me for the love of science, not because of money, or what I might be able to do for you then I think you will languish in mediocrity like most that pass through my class.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point you don\u2019t know what the hell kind of head game Dr. Kovas is playing with you, but if there is some sort of possibility that he might help you, then you might need to play along.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Or rather I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll help me for the right reasons. You\u2019re going to help, because you still believe that I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d You blurt out.\n\n\u201cHeh, well at least you\u2019re honest now. All right I\u2019m going to roll the dice with you and allow you to help me on a project I\u2019ve been working on. I\u2019ll even assure you that you will profit from this because I know you seem to be concerned about such things.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201dI\u2019m really not, I just need extra money to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt!\u201d Dr. Kovas snaps. \u201cAs I was saying, you will profit from this, but it is my hope that you will come to do this for science more than anything. Because if you aren\u2019t then you\u2019re in the wrong field.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the field of medicine was primarily to help the sick.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cBah! Helping people? Nonsense! Most so called doctors aren\u2019t in it to help people, they\u2019re in it for the money! They\u2019re all a bunch of soulless greed automatons that have no real passion for the mysteries of the human body and all this field has to offer!\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas has a reputation for misanthropy and cynicism, but you weren\u2019t aware how much until just now, still he says he\u2019s willing to help you and that\u2019s good enough for you.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow then, if you are going to help me, you need to meet me at my lab tonight and whatever you do, don\u2019t tell anyone about it. When you get inside you are NOT to discuss what you see with anyone, do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, what exactly are we going to be doing?\u201d you ask a little concerned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough, but it\u2019s a secret project that will change the way modern medicine works! I can\u2019t afford to have anyone stealing my ideas! So I need you to be all the way in on this! If you\u2019re going to hesitate, then get out of my sight right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. See you tonight.\u201d Dr. Kovas says and walks away.\n\n\n\nYou put in some time at the inn, but later leave Wendy in charge and tell her to close it down if you aren\u2019t back by closing time. You remind Alan to lock everything up. Wendy of course isn\u2019t very pleased with this idea and reminds you once again of how she\u2019s overworked. You just apologize and leave.\n\n\n\nWhen you get to Dr. Kovas\u2019 lab he doesn\u2019t immediately open the door, and you have to wait about five minutes before he comes out to scold you that you\u2019re five minutes late! You don\u2019t argue though, you just enter only for Dr. Kovas to immediately ask you a disturbing question.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you kill a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr woman, in fact a woman might be better. Yes, I need you to kill a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re literally speechless for a few moments before sputtering your protests.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Kovas, I didn\u2019t sign up to kill people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you did, the moment you said you\u2019d help me. (Sigh) Look, progress in medical science has always required sacrifices. Sometimes that sacrifice has involved the lives of others. What is one life compared to the wonders that scientific break through can do?\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas isn\u2019t just misanthropic, he\u2019s sociopathic and you\u2019re out of here.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a killer and I\u2019m not capable of this. So I\u2019m just going to leave. You needn\u2019t worry I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry son, I can\u2019t take that chance, nighty night!\u201d\n\n\n\nDr Kovas suddenly produces a needle filled with something and injects you with it. You push him away and try the door handle only to find it locked. You don\u2019t struggle with it for long though before you pass out.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up you\u2019re strapped to a table, with Dr. Kovas shaking his head at you.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with you? I placed what little faith I have in humanity in you and this is how you act? It\u2019s my own fault I suppose.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou try to talk, but most of your body is still paralyzed.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow then, I\u2019m going to give you ONE last chance because I still see potential in you. After this wears off I want you to go out and get a girl. I don\u2019t care how, just do it and bring her here. You don\u2019t even need to kill her, just bring her here and I\u2019ll do the deed. Do you think you can handle that?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou still can\u2019t talk, but you know damn well if you don\u2019t agree he\u2019s certainly going to kill you, so you strain yourself to nod \u201cyes\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019ll release you. Oh and just to let you know, you only have until dawn. I\u2019ve injected you with a toxin to ensure you don\u2019t go running off or something silly like that. Don\u2019t bother with trying to get an antidote either, it\u2019s a special toxic mix that only I have the cure to.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou get up, very wobbly and still a little dizzy. By the time you start regaining all your faculties Dr. Kovas has shoved you out his lab door and locked it.\n\n\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re living a nightmare, but you don\u2019t have much of a choice, you need to bring a woman back to the lab before dawn or you\u2019re going to die. This isn\u2019t going to be easy not just due to the immorality of the situation, but also because you haven\u2019t exactly been a ladies man. What with all the studying and work at the inn, you don\u2019t have much of a social life.\n\n\n\nYou figure your best bet might be to go to one of the many college parties near campus and hope to get a drunk girl, though you could just go get a regular whore.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to a party", "result": " \n\nNo shortage of parties going on right now and getting a drunk co-ed will be just like getting a whore except you won\u2019t have to travel as far.\n\n\n\nYou head down to the popular night club near campus called the Wild Princess. After standing in line for an hour, you\u2019re told by the bouncer that they don\u2019t need people like you in there. You don\u2019t bother arguing; you know you\u2019re too \u201cuncool\u201d to get in, so you move on.\n\n\n\nYour next stop is going to a guild house party. You manage to sneak in thanks to a lot of people more concerned with having fun rather than crashers. Unfortunately a lot of the girls there aren\u2019t remotely interested in the likes of you, but you sort of anticipated that would happen. Your plan is going to be to hang out here a few more hours then try to isolate a girl that should well be drunk at that point and offer to take her home.\n\n\n\nYou pass the time basically being a creepy stalker and watching which of the ladies are getting loaded, which of them have boyfriends, which of them are here by themselves, etc. Eventually you set your sights on a cute redhead who doesn\u2019t seem to have any attachments and is definitely wobbly.\n\n\n\nYou breathe in deeply, exhale and walk towards the girl\u2026only to get cock blocked by some guild member. Looks like he\u2019s part of the university\u2019s gladiator team too, so he\u2019d easily crush you.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey babe, come on let\u2019s get you some place where you can lie down.\u201d He says and begins to guide her towards one the bedrooms while you curse your luck.\n\n\n\nYou could try to find another girl here, but you\u2019re quite frankly sick of waiting around, you don\u2019t have all night. It occurs to you that you\u2019re a medical student while that guild guy is a muscle headed gladiator. Surely you should be able to out smart him. You see the back of his big head stand out in the crowd and follow him.\n\n\n\nHe gets the redhead to a private bedroom just like you anticipated, places her body on the bed and just as he goes to close the door you stop him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa shit dude! You\u2019re not actually going to fuck that bitch are ya?\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cHuh? Well yeah! And who the fuck are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fuck her man, she\u2019s got Rotties!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?! Really? Nah, she doesn\u2019t look like she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me dude, she does! My cousin\u2019s in medical school and he said they had to do an assignment involving volunteers who had various non-life threatening diseases and she was one of them!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wouldn\u2019t something like that be anonymous to protect the identities or some shit? And who are you again?\u201d the gladiator asks proving he isn\u2019t quite as dumb as you thought.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be anonymous, but my cousin\u2019s a inconsiderate fucktard who told me all this shit anyway. Besides isn\u2019t it good I did know and I was here to warn you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I suppose it was. Whew. Oh shit I touched her tits, I might have caught some shit!\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about it, my cousin said unless you stick your dick in her, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck that! They don\u2019t know all the shit about that disease yet! We need to get that bitch outta here before she infects everyone\u2026and burn that bed too!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou almost smile at how well this is working for you. You tell the gladiator that you\u2019ll get her out of here. He says better you than him and heads to the bathroom.\n\n\n\nThe redhead is still sort of conscious, but definitely not aware of her surroundings.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhozz you\u2026I\u2026(giggle) think I\u2026(hic) drank too mush\u2026\u201d she says as you pick her up.\n\n\n\nThe walk back to Dr. Kovas\u2019 lab is slow at first since the girl is still conscious, but eventually her incoherent babbling stops and she\u2019s completely out of it, at which point you just pick her up and carry her. Of course you\u2019re sweating being seen and questioned by campus security. Last thing you need is to get accused of date rape especially since you just saved this girl from getting date raped\u2026of course you\u2019re also taking her to her death.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just a fucked up situation no matter how you look at it!\n\n\n\nLuckily you get to the lab with no problems. You bang on the door and Dr. Kovas pulls you both inside. He looks at the girl and frowns a bit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I suppose she\u2019ll do. I\u2019m guessing you got her from one of the party\u2019s near campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not at all, young girls go to wild parties and go missing around here all the time, and I certainly don\u2019t have anything to do with all of those incidents. Anyway get her to the table and strap her down. I need to get some stuff from the back.\n\n\n\nYou follow Kovas\u2019 orders and hope that one of the things he\u2019s getting is your antidote.\n\n\n\nHe comes out with much more than your antidote, he comes out with a rolling cart filled with several medical instruments that look more like torture devices and tosses you a small vial of clear liquid.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere, take this and put on some gloves. We\u2019re about make history!\u201d he says and injects the redhead on the table with some sort of liquid. It doesn\u2019t take her long to stop breathing.\n\n\n\nYou swallow the contents of the vial which you hope is the antidote. You don\u2019t feel any different after taking it though. You half wonder if he was bluffing about poisoning you at all. If that\u2019s the case then you just brought a girl to her death for no reason, though it hardly matters at this point, as annoyed as you are at Dr. Kovas you might as well go through with this all the way.\n\n\n\nYou stand there for a moment just watching Dr. Kovas enthusiastically cutting into the girl and injecting more strange fluid directly into her vital organs. He suddenly stops when the girl comes back to life!\n\n\n\n\u201cRagh! Gargh! Argh!\u201d she growls.\n\n\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you what exactly Dr. Kovas is experimenting with, Incitahol. It\u2019s a banned concoction that was supposed to bring the dead back to life and it does, but only to create them as zombies. Lazy wannabe necromancers and mad scientists love the stuff, and would seem you\u2019re working with the latter right now.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re experimenting with incitahol? This is your big project? I thought you\u2019d be aware that this shit\u2019s only good for creating zombies and not even controllable ones!\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cAh, not yet anyway! I\u2019ve made some changes to it. If you\u2019ll notice the subject is not as aggressive as it would be under regular incitahol. Unfortunately it still seems quite hostile. I can\u2019t be sure if this due to my changes in the drug, or the alcohol in her system screwing things up. I probably should\u2019ve waited until she was sober and then proceeded (sigh) I\u2019ll need a new subject.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re hardly surprised at this request; you just say you\u2019ll get on it tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm, very well. And try to get a sober one this time!\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the course of a month you manage to get several \u201csubjects\u201d for Dr. Kovas and while he does eventually start contributing to your \u201ccollege fund\u201d you aren\u2019t exactly overjoyed with what you\u2019re doing especially since he\u2019s insulting you at every given opportunity. While it\u2019s true you are learning quite a bit about the human brain and other things about the human body he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s getting anywhere with his own experiments. As far as you can tell he\u2019s just cutting up girls and making them into zombies.\n\n\n\nOn another front, your inn staff has pretty much had it with you, specifically Wendy. She ends up quitting because she\u2019s sick of having to look after the inn all day AND night while you secretly go disappearing to kidnap young girls. Rita certainly has no intention taking up the slack so she quits as well. This pretty much leaves you no option other than selling the inn and get a cheap apartment. Between the money you get from the sale and Dr. Kovas\u2019 payment you have enough to finish up the rest of your classes, but the expenses of medical school are still going to be a struggle.\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas assures you that he can easily get you a good job at the hospital while you go through the rest of your schooling, but he\u2019ll still need you to work for him as well. On the plus side he\u2019s also offered you a free place to stay at his private lab. This would be convenient financially.\n\n\n\nThe downside to all this is of course you\u2019d still be working for Dr. Kovas and all that entails. Even if you\u2019ve managed to mostly shed yourself the moral implications of what you\u2019ve been doing, there\u2019s always the legal ones to worry about. Never mind the verbal abuse you\u2019ll have to endure.\n\n\n\nYou could just say fuck it and go do something else, which has been crossing your mind at this point. You aren\u2019t exactly sure what that might be, but after all the shit you\u2019ve been through you are a little hesitant to put yourself through more.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately your choice on whether you still want to achieve your medical profession goals or not, but in any case your days as an innkeeper are over.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue with medicine", "result": "You\u2019ve come this far; you might as well go for the gold.\n\n\n\nYou agree to help Dr. Kovas, and continue to \u201caquire\u201d subjects for him, which you\u2019ve become frighteningly good at. Time goes by and you even indulge in some of the actual killing. You certainly learn just as much from him as you do in \u201cregular class.\u201d In your spare time you do a few experiments of your own on victims you capture. Dr. Kovas doesn\u2019t really approve since its taking time away from what he wants you to be helping him with, and he feels you\u2019re just bumbling around and engaging in sadistic torture for your own twisted pleasure. (To be fair he\u2019s partially right at this point)\n\n\n\nAs for his experiments, you still don\u2019t see him making any more progress. He has managed to get the zombies to be relatively docile with training, but they\u2019re still relatively mindless. He\u2019s a scientifically minded necromancer at this point, but he\u2019s not even doing anything that useful with it. He keeps saying that he WILL succeed in bringing a being back to life fully intact without the zombification element, but it doesn\u2019t seem possible. Not even the old school magicians of legend could do that. Once the brain is completely dead, it\u2019s dead! Even through his verbal abuse you still used to respect Dr. Kovas for his dedication and his knowledge, but lately he\u2019s just been looking like a crazy old fool.\n\n\n\n\u201cArgh grah!\"\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s another one for the cages, or are we going to dispose of this one?\u201d you ask in a bored tone as Dr. Kovas fails to completely \u201cresurrect\u201d another one.\n\n\u201cDamn! I strengthened the dose to compensate for her vegetarian diet! She shouldn\u2019t be trying to bite me!\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019know we\u2019ve been doing this for about a year now and we\u2019ve still made a lot of progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019VE made a lot of progress, but what is your point?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is, maybe this just isn\u2019t in the cards. Maybe we can\u2019t bring someone back, well not in a good way at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm, what is this? A moment of conscience? Some sort of introspective that we\u2019re not supposed to play diety? You losing your passion for this work?\u201d Dr. Kovas says with a sneer.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! No, perish the thought.\u201d You laugh\n\n\u201cOh? Then what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve been thinking\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! Oh this SHOULD be amusing.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou make a slight facial tic at this insult, but then continue hoping that your \u201cmentor\u201d will listen to you.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to say is we\u2019ve got the medical knowledge and equipment to run a good body legging business. Lots of demand for body parts on the black market. And with the advances we have made with incitathol we could even sell some of the tamer zombies to wannabe necromancers or even for pit fights. It certainly would put our skills to better use.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas sighs and shakes his head at you.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my dear boy, you have learned NOTHING while serving under me! First of all, what\u2019s this we business? I\u2019M the only real doctor here; you haven\u2019t even finished medical school yet! You think you can dare put yourself on my level just because I\u2019ve allowed you to aid me and you cut up a few bubble headed co-eds? Hah! Not bloody likely! Second, you still don\u2019t get it do you? Science is not supposed to be for profit! It\u2019s about the challenges and over coming them! You want to make money why don\u2019t you go reopen that little inn you used to have and serve swill to the other low lives? Now grab that mallet over there, smash this zombie\u2019s head in and dispose of it. Menial labor is about all you\u2019re good for anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou grab the mallet, but you don\u2019t smash the zombie\u2019s head in, you smash Dr. Kovas head in instead. His arrogance and complacency allows you to get in a good shot without him expecting it and he falls to the floor bleeding profusely from the head. You kneel down to finish him off.\n\n\n\n\u201cYOU (WHAM!) FUCKING (WHAM!) PIECE OF (WHAM!) FUCKING (WHAM!) SHIT!\u201d you shout at the top of your lungs while you beat the good doctor\u2019s brains into pulp.\n\n\n\nAfter you\u2019ve satisfied your bloodlust, you sit back and think about your next move. The tied up zombie girl on the table is disturbing your concentration with her growling so you shove some of Kovas\u2019 brains in her mouth while you plan\u2026\n\n\n\nYour major obstacle is explaining Doctor Kovas\u2019 disappearance. This actually isn\u2019t that much of a problem though. The man wasn\u2019t well liked at all by his peers so nobody really goes looking for him. You are eventually asked questions by the Klyton militia, but you simply say one day you showed up to assist him and he was gone with no warning. They also ask if you know much about any of the disappearance of young girls around the university, but you say you don\u2019t know much except that it\u2019s pretty horrible. Again there is some suspicion, but not really on you and more on him.\n\n\n\nIt probably helped that the first thing you did was completely clean his lab, and left vague incriminating evidence pointing to him if suspicion should ever come up about anything. The second thing you did was clean out his savings (Lucky for you the old bastard didn\u2019t believe in keeping it at a bank) but live frugally in a cheap apartment again.\n\n\n\nBy the time you finish up medical school you\u2019re in the clear and Dr. Kovas\u2019 disappearance is chalked up to him doing something illegal and then fleeing the city. You on the other hand are now a fully-fledged doctor with access to all that entails\u2026\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need to be said that your time with Dr. Kovas warped you and while you managed to lay low when necessary, you now feel more freedom to engage in all those ideas you tried to suggest to Kovas a few years ago.\n\n\n\nThe rest of your life is basically a mask of sanity hiding a very immoral person. Your crimes are vast, routine and you could care less. Your parents failed you, the inn failed you, even your \u201cmentor\u201d failed you and as far as you\u2019re concerned you only managed to achieve your goals because YOU took charge of the situations that presented themselves and thrived.\n\n\n\nThis outlook on life never changes. You take what you want and you use people as you see fit. You never regret your decisions and feel only a weak fool would suffer any sort of guilt or remorse.\n\n\n\nAnd thanks to your intelligence, you mange to avoid punishment and you experience a death not granted to any of your many victims: Namely, you die as an old man peacefully in your bed.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Quit", "result": "After a long period of introspection, you realize your choices haven\u2019t really gotten you anywhere good. You\u2019ve alienated your mother by breaking the law. You continued to break the law while in possession of the inn and your staff grew to dislike you and you don\u2019t even own the place anymore. You moved on to being an accessory to murder in illegal experiments for monetary gain and your own obsession to go to medical school.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve managed to get away with it all so far, but for how much longer? Are you going to end up like Dr. Kovas and be a misanthropic asshole hated by your colleagues by day and be a completely batshit insane madman by night? You know you aren\u2019t a \u201cgood guy\u201d after all the shit you\u2019ve been doing, but you figure you can do something to at least keep from getting worse.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s decided, you leave Klyton with no fanfare. You aren\u2019t particularly worried about Dr. Kovas. Most likely he\u2019ll just curse you for being a \u201cweakling bound by pangs of morality\u201d but that\u2019s about it.\n\n\n\nYou end up going to Teckleville where your mom is surprised to see you. You make up with her and apologize for what happened between the both of you. You of course don\u2019t let her know about all the stuff you did while assisting Dr. Kovas.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou live with her for a while and try to figure out what you\u2019re going to do with your life and eventually you get a job as a teacher at the high school in town where your extensive knowledge on the sciences comes in quite handy and greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nFor several years you live a fairly mundane life. It\u2019s even a little boring at times, but you don\u2019t mind it. You may have lived out the rest of your days in Teckleville if things had gone right, but as they say, there ain\u2019t no rest for the wicked.\n\n\n\nWhile you were building a new life in Teckleville, Dr. Kovas was still continuing his illegal experiments; he also eventually got caught and was arrested for his crimes. He wasn\u2019t in custody for long since he was killed trying to escape. Unfortunately for you, he kept detailed journals about his experiments and your name was mentioned several times in them. (Mostly in hate filled rants after you left)\n\n\n\nOne day while you\u2019re teaching a class, the Klyton militia shows up and you already know what they\u2019re there for.\n\n\n\n\u201cUm, okay class just take out your books and read chapters twelve and thirteen until the bell rings, I have to speak to these men for a moment.\u201d You say and leave with the militia.\n\n\n\nYou are shackled and taken away in a coach. It\u2019s quite the spectacle to the folks witnessing the event. You don\u2019t ask to say goodbye to your mother, you wouldn\u2019t know how to explain this and it would just break her heart again. Granted she\u2019s going to find out eventually anyway, but you don\u2019t have to be the one to face her.\n\n\n\nYour return to Klyton is a short one since you immediately plead guilty to the judge. No sense in drawing it out you think. You spend your last few days in a cell waiting to be hanged, thinking about the mistakes you made and how you\u2019re finally sorry that you didn\u2019t make better choice when you had the chance.\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re at the gallows you are asked if you have any last words, but you have none.

Who\u2019s going to miss a whore right? The only thing you really need to worry about is getting mugged while you\u2019re looking for one.\n\n\n\nYou take a deep breath and catch a coach to the slums of Klyton.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take you long to get propositioned several times when you arrive.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey baby, you like what you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmmm, come put your dick in this slice of paradise!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see these lips?

If she turns up missing, he\u2019s likely to seek you out and take the loss out on your hide or even blackmail you. You excuse yourself and continue to wander the streets.\n\n\n\nYou travel into an even more destitute area of the slums looking for a whore, which is proving to be a lot harder than you thought it would be. You eventually find what you\u2019re looking for and they\u2019re revolting. The drug whores are certainly out in force tonight.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got some green lotus or yellow devil? I\u2019ll suck your dick!\u201d is what most of the drug whores say to you. You almost figure you\u2019d be doing them a favor by getting them killed. You pick the one who looks least likely to infect you just by breathing on you. (The irony that you\u2019re already infected by a killer toxin isn\u2019t lost on you.)\n\n\n\nYou hand her several gold coins, probably the most money she\u2019s seen in a long time and is ready to take you around the corner and blow you, but you have to explain that you\u2019re heading to some place nicer and warm, with lots of drugs! She seems to like that idea, so she agrees to follow you.\n\n\n\nFortunately you manage to catch another coach relatively quickly and your trip back to the campus is uneventful other than the ramblings and awful coughing of your \u201clady friend.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou arrive to the lab with your whore in tow and Dr. Kovas pulls you both in all the while not looking impressed.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? You got a whore? I could\u2019ve got a whore!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d watch your tongue boy if you want that antidote.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook I did what you said! Just cure me now!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet, I need you to do one more thing, here.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas points you to a syringe on a table filled with something. Something not good no doubt. It\u2019s obvious he wants you to inject the whore with it.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, you said all I had to do is bring her here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well I think under the circumstances you\u2019re ready to take the next step for science.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey wait, am I doing both of you? That\u2019s okay I guess, but this is extra.\u201d The whore says still not grasping the situation.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you shake your head, knowing it\u2019s useless to argue. You almost feel like grabbing the syringe and running over to stab him with it, but you still need the antidote and then you\u2019d probably have to still kill the whore too.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright honey, I\u2019m gonna take care of you.\u201d you say holding the syringe and approaching the whore.\n\n\u201cOooh now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Shoot me up.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou inject the eager whore with the needle and she soon falls unconscious.\n\n\n\n\u201cQuickly, bring her to the table!\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile you do so, Dr. Kovas disappears to the back of his lab. You check the girl and realize she\u2019s stopped breathing. You\u2019ve killed her, though you\u2019re not really surprised, you\u2019re just hoping that Kovas is coming out with your antidote.\n\n\n\nHe comes out with much more than your antidote, he comes out with a rolling cart filled with several medical instruments that look more like torture devices and tosses you a small vial of clear liquid.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere, take this and put on some gloves. We\u2019re about make history!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou swallow the contents of the vial which you hope is the antidote. You don\u2019t feel any different after taking it though. You half wonder if he was bluffing about poisoning you at all. If that\u2019s the case then you just killed a girl for no reason, though it hardly matters at this point, as mad as you are at Dr. Kovas you might as well go through with this all the way.\n\n\n\nYou stand there for a moment just watching Dr. Kovas enthusiastically cutting into the girl and injecting more strange fluid directly into her vital organs. He doesn\u2019t seem to be paying attention to anything else, until he suddenly stops.\n\n\n\n\u201cHold on wait, did you strap her down? Shit you didn\u2019t strap her down! Quick, tie her up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you say not really understanding why you\u2019d need to do it, but you find out when she suddenly comes to life!\n\n\n\n\u201cTie her feet! Tie her feet!\u201d Dr. Kovas yells as he shackles her arms to the table. You grab the rope on the cart and begin tying her feet, which are twitching as much as she\u2019s making some no longer human noises.\n\n\n\n\u201cRaagh. Gargah! Arrgh!\u201d\n\n\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you what exactly Dr. Kovas is experimenting with, Incitahol. It\u2019s a banned concoction that was supposed to bring the dead back to life and it does, but only to create them as zombies. Lazy wannabe necromancers and mad scientists love the stuff, and would seem you\u2019re working with the latter right now.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re experimenting with incitahol? This is your big project? I thought you\u2019d be aware that this shit\u2019s only good for creating zombies and not even controllable ones!\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cAh, not yet anyway! I\u2019ve made some changes to it. If you\u2019ll notice the subject is not as aggressive as it would be under regular incitahol. Unfortunately it was still quite hostile and nearly bit my ear when I was trying to strap it down. I can\u2019t be sure if this due to my changes in the drug, or the fact that this subject\u2019s organs were heavily damaged due to her own major drug use and life style. Probably had several sexual diseases too, who knows what those factors might\u2019ve played. This is why I didn\u2019t want a drug addled whore (sigh) I\u2019ll need a new subject.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re a little put off, considering he did say he didn\u2019t care what kind of girl you got. You\u2019re hardly surprised though; you just say you\u2019ll get on it tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou? No I don\u2019t think so. I think I\u2019m misjudged your abilities considering you\u2019ve been argumentative and an utter failure in bringing me a good test subject. No I do not think there will be anymore chances. You may leave, I\u2019m done with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nNOW you\u2019re surprised and more than a little pissed. This dick has been insulting you, poisoned you, made you kill a girl and now he\u2019s just dismissing you like some flunky without even paying you for your time?\n\n\n\n\u201cOh is that how it is? Well you still owe me money for this!\u201d\n\n\u201cOwe? I don\u2019t owe you anything. You did this for science m\u2019boy. You should be happy you\u2019re alive so that you can live out the rest of your boring existence.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the last straw, you aren\u2019t going to take it anymore and you snap. You immediately attack Dr. Kovas who anticipates your attack by dodging it. You crash straight into the zombie whore\u2019s table and are unfortunately bit in the arm.\n\n\n\n\u201cArrrrgh! My arm!\u201d you scream struggling to get your arm out of the zombie whore\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cNargh Gabrah Raagh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess you still might have your uses\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou feel a crushing blow to the back of your head and that\u2019s the last thing you experience in your life.\n\n\n\nYour short undead \u201clife\u201d isn\u2019t even worth mentioning.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go to the Klyton Militia", "result": "You won\u2019t do it, you won\u2019t kill anyone and you\u2019re not going to bring someone to Dr. Kovas for him to murder either.

It isn\u2019t dawn yet, but you can\u2019t be sure if it isn\u2019t the poison or not, of course it could just be the stress of the night finally getting to you. In any case you close your eyes to darkness.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up you\u2019re surprised to see your mom sitting there.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh by the gods, thanks to them you\u2019re alive!\u201d\n\n\u201cMom?

Being your only immediate family, she also regained possession of the inn while you were incapacitated and possibly on your deathbed.

I can\u2019t afford to lose my job and a free place on top of everything right now. I\u2019ll do something about my kids. (Sigh) I just hope I can do something about Henry. I\u2019m not sure anything is going to help. I have to admit, I\u2019m not looking forward to him when he becomes a teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, have you thought about sending him away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish.

You have your doubts if the militia program will help him, but he\u2019s out of your life now and that\u2019s what is important.\n\n\n\nThe best thing is, this event scared Wendy\u2019s other two kids so much that they straighten up so as not to suffer the same fate.\n\n\n\nTime passes and everything seems to be going well until one day when you get another visit from the Klyton militia who storm in the same way they did when they took away Henry.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou the owner of this establishment?\u201d the sergeant asks.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you answer groggily\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re under arrest for serving illegal substances.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!

Guess which one you got in the most trouble?\n\n\n\nYou spend almost all your money on a lawyer, and your inn is taken away by the city, along with your dreams of going into medicine. After all is said and done you\u2019ve lost everything and are completely broke.

Sure you still have the inn, and if you made some cuts you could keep it running, but why bother? You never wanted to run this damn thing in the first place. This is all your parents fault, they pushed you in one direction and then they fuck up and you have to go into another direction. A direction which ended up leading to ruin.

Not as much as you like, but it\u2019s enough to keep you from having to do anything for a while. You spend the next few months mainly picking up loose co-eds at the university. It\u2019s a lot of fun, but as the money starts running out, you realize you\u2019re going to have to get a job again.\n\n\n\nYou wind up getting a job as a lowly clerk doing boring file keeping, but you pretty much slack off on that job quite a bit. You mostly get away with it for a long time, but eventually much like your cheating you don\u2019t get away with it forever and you\u2019re fired.\n\n\n\nAfter a couple more failed attempts at keeping a job in the city, you\u2019ve got no choice, but to either become a beggar or apologize to your mom in Teckleville and hope she takes you in for a while.\n\n\n\nYou take the remaining amount of your money and take a one-way trip to Teckleville and mentally prepare yourself for a lot of apologizing, even if you don\u2019t really mean it.

You explain your situation though omit some of the information (like cheating) and replace it with a hard luck story instead. This of course is followed by a lot of apologies and stating how she was right all along. It works and she takes you in.\n\n\n\nOf course the problem is now you\u2019re living with your mom and while she\u2019s forgiven you, she doesn\u2019t expect you to sit around doing nothing which you\u2019ve decided to continue doing. This willful sloth, leads to a cycle of several never-ending arguments, but the result is always the same. You either get a odd job around the town to get your mom off your back for awhile or she throws you out and you live with your crazy aunt Enora for awhile until you can\u2019t put up with her quirkiness anymore and you get an odd job around town anyway and beg to move back in with your mom (who always accepts mainly because she still has a lingering feeling of guilt that maybe her and your dad really are responsible for your decline).\n\n\n\nThe rest of your life is a rather miserable one and not very interesting in the scheme of things.

Face it; I do more around here than ANYONE to keep this place successful, and I deserve some credit for it!\u201d Rita demands.\n\n\u201cHey we all know Rita, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nothing, if you expect me to keep working here, I want a raise and I don\u2019t want to be working as some lowly barmaid anymore! I\u2019m above serving food and drinks!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you basically want to be paid to stand around and look pretty? What the hell kind of job title would we even call that?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cI dunno, hostess maybe? Yeah, I\u2019d be the hostess!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the gods, this is ridiculous! You can\u2019t seriously be considering this!\u201d Wendy exclaims.\n\n\n\nThe only people who are silent in all this are Eliza who is being her usual quiet self, and your mother who just shrugs and says it\u2019s your call since this was mainly your idea. You get the impression she doesn\u2019t care for Rita\u2019s attitude though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make Rita a hostess", "result": " \n\nSometimes you have to take risks to get ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright fine, if that\u2019s the way this is going, then we don\u2019t have much of a choice.

Now that should make you feel a little bit better now shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore Wendy can reply, your mother speaks up.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? We can\u2019t afford all this or have you forgotten that we still have to pay off Mr. Reynolds?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are, and we will. But this place has finally gotten the kind of business it should be getting and we need to broaden our base. We\u2019re getting more than just miners and low ranking adventurers; we\u2019re starting to get a slightly higher class of patrons. I think these changes will be good in the long run, so are we all in agreement?\u201d\n\n\n\nEveryone seems to nod and be fine with their new job titles/promotions and the idea of making the inn into a better moneymaker. Just then Eliza speaks up after being quiet the whole time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a suggestion. If we\u2019re branching out past our usual miner customers shouldn\u2019t we change the name of the inn to something slightly more inclusive?\u201d\n\n\n\nEliza has a point, after thinking about it, you come up with \u201cThe Traveler\u2019s Inn\u201d which seems to be as good as name as any to signify people other than miners come here. The changes are made\u2026\n\n\n\nMonths pass and everything goes as well as expected. Everyone is a little busier, but the inn is finally making a lot more profit and you were right, eventually you get out of Mr. Reynolds\u2019 debt. You half expect him to try to pull a fast one to get more money out of you, but with the increase in Klyton Militia hanging around, he doesn\u2019t and just says if you ever need another loan in the future you know where to find him. You\u2019re definitely not going to let that happen.\n\n\n\nYou also re-establish your alcohol supplier with Klyton again. You\u2019re making enough money to afford it and you won\u2019t have to deal with Calwin anymore.\n\n\n\nThe inn is profitable again and you\u2019ve effectively saved the place and your mother from potential danger (as well as yourself) but taking over your father\u2019s inn wasn\u2019t your dream and it wasn\u2019t your parents\u2019 dreams either. They pushed you to make something better of yourself and it stuck.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not going to give up now, you have to find out a way of raising enough money to put yourself through school again AND finding the time to study while running the inn. You try to think about how you\u2019re going to accomplish this, and you know you've got quite the challenge ahead of you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back to school...", "result": "A year has passed and you\u2019re back in college, though it\u2019s not as much fun as it was when you didn\u2019t need to worry about where your tuition was coming from or having something like a job.\n\n\n\nFinding time to study while running the inn is difficult, but fortunately your mother picks up some of the slack when you really need time. You\u2019ve also managed to re-establish some old contacts with people you were \u201cfriends\u201d with before your \u201cbreak\u201d. Most of them are ahead of you and some are getting ready to graduate. While none of them bothered to stay in contact with you (so much for education breaking down class distinctions) a few of them are still willing to help you out by selling you books for cheap or giving you some of their old notes. Every little bit helps.\n\n\n\nAs for the inn, it\u2019s doing well, but you constantly worry about its future profitability. You\u2019ve got a much broader customer base and even classed the place up a bit, but this isn\u2019t without its drawbacks. Namely the Flying Griffon Inn has stepped up its efforts to get back its customers. This has so far involved an aggressive advertising campaign, hiring a bunch of sexy barmaids and special deals. So far it has helped them a lot and if they continue to succeed, your inn is going to start losing money and you can\u2019t have that. It doesn\u2019t help that your place isn\u2019t in as good of a location as the Flying Griffon\n\n\n\nSo first things first, you need to figure out how to deal with Flying Griffon and you call a staff meeting in the hopes of getting some other ideas on how to deal with them.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just hire someone to cut up their slutty barmaids? I mean that\u2019s what\u2019s mainly getting the main draw right? Seems like you could easily solve the problem by getting rid of them.\u201d Rita says. Naturally this doesn\u2019t go over well with the others.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d Eliza says\n\n\u201c What? I didn\u2019t say kill them, they\u2019d still be able to work and shit.

By the gods, we\u2019re not doing that, we\u2019re not the Crimson Talons!\u201d Wendy shouts.\n\n\n\nAs much as disfiguring Flying Griffon\u2019s staff would solve some problems, you hesitate to resort to such measures.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we could offer deals to traveling merchants like Flying Griffon does, like they get a discount on their rooms?\u201d your mom suggests.\n\n\u201cNot sure if that\u2019s going to help us a lot, unless we make an addition to the inn. It\u2019s not like our rooms aren\u2019t being used. If we start giving discount to merchants we might attract them, but we might not have enough rooms to accommodate them or we\u2019ll be accommodating them, but won\u2019t be accommodating adventurer types who are paying full price.\u201d Wendy says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re so knowledgeable Wendy, what\u2019s YOUR solution?\u201d Rita sneers.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Klyton Milita that come here to drink now don\u2019t we? Why don\u2019t we get some of them to help us? Seems like some very public investigation during heavy business hours would help out a lot and ruin the reputation of Flying Griffon. Hell, maybe they\u2019ll even find something and we\u2019ll really get lucky.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou take all these suggestions into consideration, but you can\u2019t help notice that Eliza looks like she wants to say something.\n\n\n\n\u201cEliza, do you have a suggestion?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? Oh. Um\u2026yes\u2026but I... Just forget it. It\u2019s silly anyway. The rest of your ideas sound better.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, just spit it out!\u201d Wendy demands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just tell us.\u201d You say with a lot less intimidation.\n\n\u201cWell okay, but it\u2019s silly. I was going to suggest getting someone on the inside to spy on the place and finding something to use against them. It seems odd that they are managing to attract that much attention with just pretty barmaids when we have our own. I think maybe something else is going on there, like an illegal brothel or something.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost of you are surprised that Eliza came up with something so complex.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a very elaborate plan Eliza, but I think we could accomplish the same thing just by sending in our militia buddies to harass them.

I mean he\u2019s sort of a connection right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must be joking!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, I mean surely for a fee he could lend you that ogre for a little while right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno if it works that way\u2026(Sigh) alright I suppose I could try since I don\u2019t have any other contacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Oh! Here take this.\u201d Rita says handing you a small notebook.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the name of every whore that works for the Flying Griffon and their physical description.

They\u2019re not freelancing for me anymore sadly. The Crimson Talons have them doing something more directly important for them. I believe they fight at one of those underground gladiator matches now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, can I get in contact with them some how?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha ha! Well I suppose I could tell you, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d necessarily let you in, I guess you\u2019d have to speak to whoever\u2019s in charge and well it would be a big hassle really\u2026what did you need them for anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it any of your business?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if Olaf and Silence had still been freelancing for me it would\u2019ve been, but I guess not now.

Tom always was the weakest of you three, but he always went along despite protests. You have no doubt David\u2019s capable of committing the act, you just wonder if he\u2019s gotten any brighter since then.

Um, nothing. Me and David just work for Mr. Reynolds beating people up who don\u2019t pay. So you owed him money before we worked for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not me, but my family borrowed some. It\u2019s all in the past though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. It would\u2019ve been weird seeing each other again under those circumstances. I don\u2019t think I could intimidate your mom.

Instead you go into an alley.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s a list of the girls you need to confront, their names, descriptions, and even addresses for most of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit, what the hell did you stalk \u2018em or something?

If you haven\u2019t finished the job by then, we\u2019ll meet again there in two more days and that should hopefully give you enough time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019ll be done before then, but fine we\u2019ll do it this way since you think your inn is obviously too good for us\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit!

I\u2019m friends with several Klyton militia and an investigation would certainly follow if I were to suddenly disappear.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrank smirks and your attempt to intimidate him.\n\n\n\n\u201cTruly? Might I also tell these same militia friends of your of how you hired two thugs to cut up my employees? But let\u2019s get to the point, you\u2019ve done a lot of damage to my business and I think some reparations are in order. I want your inn.

These two guys holding me will do, I just need some people fucked up and I got money to give to whoever will do it!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bartender nods and you\u2019re released.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright in my office and start talkin\u2019 fast. Reg, you\u2019re at the bar.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou follow the bartender upstairs to a room that is much nicer than the rest of place. He sits down at a fancy desk and pours himself a drink, but doesn\u2019t offer you anything. You look around the office at the various items he has on the wall until you\u2019re interrupted.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell? Are we just wasting my time here while you admire my office, because the fight pit is another place you can admire from the inside.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou quickly explain everything and your situation and give him the information that Rita wrote down for you. The bartender nods a bit while playing with his ring. When you\u2019re done, he speaks.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that it? You wanted to hire two bruisers like that to cut up some barmaids? You\u2019re sort of new at this I take it. Those two would\u2019ve probably raped and broke all their necks right in the middle of the fucking Flying Griffon. Subtlety is not their strong point.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay so do you have someone else in mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, got a mean ass Sotakan assassin that could easily do the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Sotakan? One of those lizard people? But they avoid cities.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cThat they do, but let\u2019s just say I acquired this one from an egg. The great thing about him, is he\u2019s completely loyal and doesn\u2019t require much. Just does what he\u2019s told.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s he sneak around though? I mean seems like he\u2019d stick out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHah, those lizard bastards have natural camouflage abilities. As they grow up they adapt to whatever sort of environment they grow up in. Now a regular swamp dwelling Sotakan would stick out, but not my boy. He\u2019s lived here in the city his whole life, took him out in the night to get acquainted with the surroundings while he grew up and now he\u2019s practically invisible when he wants to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay well that\u2019s great, but I don\u2019t need them killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeh, maybe not all of them, but a couple may come back to kill you. I think I may have a little more information on the Flying Griffon than your barmaid found out. Frank\u2019s an unregistered wizard. Well wizard\u2019s giving him a little too much credit perhaps, but he\u2019s managed to snag himself a couple of succubae as barmaids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?! He can\u2019t summon demons into the city! That\u2019s illegal!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh and I suppose what we\u2019re doing is?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, but it\u2019s not only illegal, but it\u2019s a potential danger to the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I agree. Demons tend to fuck up business and their chaotic ways are too much of a risk to deal with, but then again I don\u2019t have to tell you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026how do you know all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s my fucking job to know shit that might interfere with business that\u2019s why. I kept wondering why some of my merchant contacts weren\u2019t stopping by here anymore. Frank might have some control over his ladies, but I know he can\u2019t completely stop their appetites. Rather short sighted of him really, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to be able to stop themselves from completely draining victims forever. They\u2019re going to eventually get out of hand and he\u2019s going to start having to explain to the Klyton militia why people are always last seen going into his place before mysteriously disappearing. You must\u2019ve really pissed him off for him to resort to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess so\u2026so where does that leave us?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bartender (who mentions his name is Edmond and is definitely more than just bartender) says that he was keeping an eye on the Flying Griffon and if he lost anymore of his merchant contact to it, he was going to act. He didn\u2019t before since as skilled as his lizard is, he\u2019s not sure if he can take two succubae by himself, in fact it would be easier to just try and kill Frank. But of course then there would be two unleashed succubae running around in Klyton and nobody really wants that.\n\n\n\nStill, if you\u2019re willing to pay then Edmond will readily accept your money, and he\u2019ll have the mortal barmaids disfigured and the demonic ones killed. He assures you that unlike Mr. Reynolds this will be a straight up agreement and that the Crimson Talons will not seek to extort your inn in some way. Mainly due to all the Klyton militia and adventurers going there it wouldn\u2019t be worth the trouble. He doesn\u2019t need to risk some do gooder or gung-ho orderly type sniffing around.\n\n\n\nOf course you\u2019ve been overwhelmed by all this information. Part of you wonders if all this is worth it. You could wait it out, Edmond did claim that Frank probably won\u2019t be able to control them forever; the problem with this is in the meantime it\u2019ll still be cutting into your business.\n\n\n\nWith this new information you could also report Frank to your militia buddies, though this might be difficult without evidence. Still, you\u2019re on good terms with most of the ones that frequent your place and they\u2019ll probably investigate.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hire the assassin", "result": " \n\nYou don\u2019t have any proof to give to the militia other than Edmond\u2019s information and you can\u2019t afford to wait around and hope things get better.

Are you absolutely sure you want to do this? Edmond asks.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019d be lying if I said yes, but this is something that has to be done. You won\u2019t get any complaints from me. I just hope your lizard can do the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I hope so too, because if not, we\u2019re both going to be in for a fight if we have angry succubae after us. I want five hundred gold by tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive\u2026that\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fuckin\u2019 cheap to hire the best! You\u2019re only getting a discount due to the fact that this is something I was thinking about doing anyway! Now if you don\u2019t like the price\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can get it. When\u2019s the job going to be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight if possible, but I suspect it might take my boy into the wee hours of the morning since he\u2019s dealing with other worldly beings and all. If he hasn\u2019t done it by the time you come by with the money tomorrow, then he\u2019s failed and you can keep half of your money because I\u2019m a nice guy. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm\u2026good I guess, but I\u2019d rather he succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he will. So is our business done or did you still want to see the fight pits? I\u2019m sure Olaf\u2019s eating his competitior right about now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, that\u2019s okay I should be getting back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re able to get a coach back to inn, naturally it\u2019s a lot later now and everyone is asking you where you\u2019ve been. You explain that you forgot to do something at campus for a class, which seems to satisfy as an excuse.\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of the night, you\u2019re preoccupied with your decision. Wondering if it\u2019s going to fail or not. You barely get any sleep and the next day at your classes you can barely concentrate. You basically wander the day in a haze until it\u2019s time for you to go pay Edmond.\n\n\n\nWhen you enter the Troll\u2019s Breath, Edmond points to his office and you follow.\n\n\n\n\u201cTold you my boy could do it. Now aren\u2019t you glad you made this decision? You got my money?\u201d Edmond asks in a friendly tone.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026you mean that\u2019s it? It succeeded?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it did! I figured you already knew it did given that you\u2019re closer to the Flying Griffon and are friends with all those Klyton militia folks\u2026I mean it\u2019s pretty big news! Flying Griffon Massacre they\u2019re calling it! \u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been so caught up in your own worry you haven\u2019t been paying much attention to outside discussion or events. You feel a sense of relief, but then you question the word\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cMassacre?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah the demons are dead and Frank is going to jail. Seems that the militia think he was making human sacrifices to summon up the demons and it all got out of hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, why would they think all that?\n\n\u201cEh, well apparently my boy had some problems understanding the differences in the terms disfigure and dismember, so he killed those human barmaids in a rather gruesome fashion, but on the bright side it completely puts all the blame on Frank. They figured he or the succubae killed the barmaids and then the succubae tried to rebel against their master he was forced to kill them. Being an unlicensed mage certainly doesn\u2019t help him. In any case the heat doesn\u2019t even trace back to us as long you don\u2019t start acting suspicious around your militia buddies, which I trust you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re a little in shock as the realization that you\u2019ve just participated in murder. Granted you weren\u2019t doing a good thing anyway, but disfiguring is still a lot different than murder. You don\u2019t say anything since you promised that you wouldn\u2019t whine about having a guilty conscious afterwards.\n\n\n\nEdmond takes your money and makes you stay until it is all counted. When it is, he says you can leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh one more thing. I hear you\u2019re going into medicine. Very useful profession, I could use a competent doctor every once in awhile; gods know that drunk that I currently have on my payroll is barely useful. I hope I can call upon you in the future if I need to.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd there it is, the \u201ccatch\u201d for doing business with a criminal. You could kick yourself in the head for actually believing that this was going to be a straight up transaction. He may not be extorting your inn; he\u2019s just hanging a \u201cfavor\u201d over your head in the future. Somehow that\u2019s almost worse.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s little you can do about it now though, you head back to the inn where your patrons and staff are all talking about what happened at the Flying Griffon. Rita in particular speaks to you about it.\n\n\n\n\u201cSheesh, I didn\u2019t know you were going to go to that extreme, but can\u2019t say those bitches didn\u2019t deserve it. That\u2019s what happens when you work with demons right? Who knew Frank was a mage? Well at least we don\u2019t have any competition anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nRita\u2019s callous talk about the Griffon barmaids makes you angry. In fact all of this was Rita\u2019s initial suggestion and while you listened to it, that doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t suffer the negative consequences for it too. You snap and grab Rita by the arm roughly and pull her into the cellar. Flameflower and Sunshine are down there drinking your wine supply.\n\n\n\n\u201cErm\u2026uh\u2026(giggle)\u201d is all Sunshine can utter when getting busted,\n\n\u201cIf you two halfbreed bitches don\u2019t get upstairs and start doing some actual work for a change you\u2019re gonna get some of what Rita\u2019s about to get! MOVE!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to say it twice, your tone is enough to sober them up and get them moving.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you? You better let me go, and what the hell do you mean I\u2019m getting something? You better not be implying what I think you\u2019re implying. You so much as start grabbing my tits and I\u2019ll scr\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t let Rita finish; you just slam her up against the wall as hard as you can with your hand over her mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitch I wouldn\u2019t touch your gold digging fuckhole with a ten pole. You think those girls deserved to die? Oh no, you just felt that they needed to be disfigured; well maybe you need to be mutilated. Take your ass down a few notches.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point you grab a nearby candle and start holding it need Rita\u2019s face. She pulls away and tears start.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh what\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t like being a victim? Well how do you think those girls felt in their final moments?!\u201d you say and throw Rita to the floor.\n\n\n\n\u201cI fucking caused that to happen! And guess what? So did you. So if you\u2019re not going to feel bad about it, you\u2019re at least going to feel bad in other ways. I\u2019m lowering your pay and if you don\u2019t like it, tough shit, you can quit. I can get some other shallow whore to do your job, you\u2019re not special. And if you\u2019re getting some sort of bright ideas about reporting me to the militia or some shit, remember what happened at the Flying Griffon? Well I can make that happen to you too.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou leave on that threatening note, while Rita tries to compose herself. You\u2019re a little surprised that Rita\u2019s \u201ctough girl\u201d act was broken so easily, you\u2019re also surprised at your own actions. The scary part to you is that it was easy and how you feel a lot better now.\n\n\n\nYou exit the cellar and a few moments later Rita follows. This leads to a few whispers amongst your staff. Everyone assumes that you and Rita must\u2019ve had some rough sex. Your mother even approaches you about it.\n\n\n\n\u201cFar be it from me to interfere with your personal life, but if you\u2019re going to insist on having sex with the help, I\u2019d appreciate it if you at least took Rita up to your room and NOT anywhere on the business premises!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026okay mom.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Sigh) I mean\u2026(Sigh) Rita? You could do so much better! Sure she\u2019s pretty, but the girl is a shallow gold digger and not even a very good one! Couldn\u2019t you at least picked Eliza? I could\u2019ve understood that, she\u2019s sweet. Or how about a nice girl at your college? You know like one with a bright future ahead of her? (Sigh) I just hope for your sake you didn\u2019t get that little tart pregnant!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou just nod and agree with your mother the whole time. It\u2019s better if everyone thinks that you were fucking Rita rather than the truth anyway.\n\n\n\nWith the Flying Griffon closed down, business picks up and you don\u2019t have as many financial worries any longer. You\u2019re not out of the woods yet though since now you\u2019re in your final stages of your education, which means medical school as well as having to get a job actually working at a hospital. The only problem with that is being an intern doesn\u2019t pay all that well and you certainly can\u2019t do that AND work at the bar.\n\n\n\nYour mother reassures you that you shouldn\u2019t worry about it as she\u2019ll be able to hire a couple extra people as well as being able to help with the rest of your tuition.\n\n\n\nIn any case it looks like your days as an innkeeper are over.", "action_results": [{"action": "Future Prospects", "result": "A few years have passed and your medical schooling is complete and you now work at the Klyton hospital as a real doctor. You haven\u2019t been able to really enjoy your success though.\n\n\n\nSure, you have your own apartment and you make a decent living to afford the things you want, but you\u2019re always waiting for the other shoe to drop and Edmond is going to call in that favor. It\u2019s prevented you from even having a serious relationship for fear that whomever you\u2019re with could possibly be hurt if things get\u2026complex.\n\n\n\nOf course there\u2019s also your mother to worry about still, but from what you know she\u2019s planning on selling the old inn and moving to Teckleville. Hopefully soon, so it\u2019ll at least keep her somewhat out of potential harm.\n\n\n\nUltimately you try to keep yourself busy with work hoping it will keep your mind off things, but it doesn\u2019t help. Eventually you do come up with something that does help a bit. Alcohol.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that you grew up in a place that sells the stuff and never had a drink until now. You have to say, it\u2019s not bad and it seems to calm you a bit when you\u2019re feeling anxious.

Right?\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cCorrect. I think you know what comes next doc.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d You say and get into the carriage.\n\n\n\nYou sit down on one side while sitting opposite of you is one man dressed in a cheap suit smoking pipe weed. The other one is dressed more casually and openly playing with a dagger. The pipe man lights up and speaks.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore we get started, my name\u2019s Hans and this is my brother Wallace. Now that that\u2019s over with, Edmond is personally in need of your medical services.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured it was something like that. What happened to him?\n\n\u201cOh what usually happens to our kind in this business. There was a disagreement, some words were exchanged and before you know it, some people get hurt while others aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026see. So I take it we\u2019re heading to him right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s a little paranoid about going to hospitals especially with the attempt on his life and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, doesn\u2019t he already have a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did, but unfortunately his over indulgence of the spirits made his skills useless and he was\u2026sent away a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest of the trip is mostly in silence. Hans asks a few superficial things about you which you give quick answer to, but your mind is focused more on what you\u2019re going to encounter when you get to Edmond. How bad is he going to be? What happens if you can\u2019t help him? By the gods you could use a drink right now.\n\n\n\nYou then think to yourself. \u201cMaybe this is why his old doctor was a drunk.\u201d\n\n\n\nEventually you arrive at the Troll\u2019s Breath Tavern. When you enter the place it\u2019s completely empty save for a few rough looking sorts who look like they\u2019re focused on cleaning up the place. You notice broken glass and a few blood spots here and there.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that the doc?\u201d one of them asks Hans.\n\n\u201cYeah, is Ed still in his office?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and his pet lizard is guarding him like a fucking dragon. Ed\u2019s not letting anyone in there except the doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm, well I guess you better get in there then. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re probably safer than the rest of us right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t share that sentiment, but you have little choice in the matter. You head to Edmond\u2019s office and knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho the fuck is it? That better be the doc!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m coming in.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou cautiously enter and see a great deal of blood on the floor. Edmond is clutching on to his left side and his Sotakan assassin is standing close by staring directly at you. A bottle whiskey is also nearby probably being used to dull his pain and as a disinfectant.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there, I gotta fucking hole in my side!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou quickly inspect the wound and see that Edmond\u2019s been shot most likely by a blunderbuss and he\u2019s still got fragments of the shot in his body.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, keep the pressure on it like you\u2019ve been doing. I can fix this, but I need to act fast and I\u2019m gonna need some stuff from the hospital.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cWhat?! You mean those idiots didn\u2019t have you pick up any supplies?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they told me to just get into the carriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cFucking morons. It\u2019s like they want me to die! Okay look, we got access to some hospital supplies in a warehouse much closer than the hospital. Just tell Reg outside what you need and he\u2019ll get them for you. Go, go.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou leave the office and ask for Reg, who comes up immediately.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Will he live?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll need some medical supplies.

Now I need\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore you can finish Hans interjects.\n\n\n\n\u201cReg, you realize we sold most of those supplies to that bodylegger a few weeks ago?

But what if you get there and find that what the doc asked for isn\u2019t there? We\u2019ve wasted valuable time fucking around while the boss bleeds to death! Look why don\u2019t we just take the doctor back to the hospital, I\u2019m sure we can get everything there right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell yeah, but Edmond said\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Edmond won\u2019t mind if disobey his orders if it\u2019s going to save his life.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell this certainly stressful. If the warehouse is lacking supplies, you might not be able to help Edmond.

You just hope Edmond\u2019s constitution is as good as Reg claims.\n\n\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to leave a couple of gunshots are heard followed by the death yelps of several men.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh shit! It\u2019s a hit!\u201d Reg shouts scrambling for his flintlock pistol, while the sounds of several footsteps enter the building.\n\n\n\nYou start to panic and look for another exit, but it\u2019s hard to see in this darkness, so you fumble around trying to stay hidden. A couple more gunshots are heard followed by the slumping of a couple of bodies.\n\n\n\n\u201cArgh shit!!\u201d you hear Reg shout. This is followed by a set of running footsteps and the sound of a sword hitting something. You don\u2019t hear Reg anymore.\n\n\n\nYou creep behind a bunch of boxes hoping that you\u2019re not found, but it doesn\u2019t work. A hand suddenly grabs you and turns you around.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are doc. I really wish this could\u2019ve been different, I really do.

I hope you realize this isn\u2019t going to be the last time he calls on you again.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything. You were trying not to dwell on the possibility of such depressing matters.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook friend, I know you. You\u2019d rather not have to live your life being connected to the underworld, but you were in a tight spot, so you resorted to desperate measures.

I mean I know what it\u2019s like to get so far deep into something that you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re ever going to get out. Hell, I never intended to be part of the Crimson Talons, but I had to do it not just for my survival but my brother\u2019s as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou say nothing and wait for Hans to get to the point he\u2019s going to make.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, you don\u2019t NEED to have this hanging over your head forever. You could end it tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on, if we\u2019re talking about what I think we are, you heard Reg, he said if we took too long he\u2019d have us all killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest that. I mean that hospital surely has a bunch of things that shouldn\u2019t be used in excessive dosages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to kill him? I can\u2019t do that, I\u2019d get killed by that Sotakan! If not immediately then certainly soon after he suspected that I had something to do with his death!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I figured that you\u2019d be a little creative in that area. Perhaps give him something for the pain. Something that creates a plausible tale that the man just died in his sleep. It\u2019s not like that lizard is really going to put two and two together. It\u2019s not the brightest thing; it\u2019s just really good at following orders and killing people. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it anyway. The lizard will be taken care of soon. And you needn\u2019t worry about anyone else potentially retaliating either, Edmond\u2019s never been too popular and what few loyal cronies he has other than the lizard will also be dealt with.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou bury your hands in your head at the thought of all this and how you got here in the first place. If you go through with this, you won\u2019t just be an accomplice the murder anymore, but a full blown one. You think about the irony of being a doctor. You\u2019re supposed to be keeping people alive not killing them.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, I know this is all a lot to take in, but just think. If you do this, you\u2019re free. Free to go about the rest of your life as you see fit. And getting rid of Edmond would be a favor to everyone; he\u2019s an evil bastard. Now I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a saint, but the man is unnecessarily brutal. I\u2019d at least try to put an end to some of the random violence that goes on in the organization and get back to focusing on business. Hell, I\u2019ve got even a long-term plan of trying to make the organization legit one day. Like I said, I didn\u2019t really want this life, but it was survival at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Hans is trying to identify with you on some level to get you to help him, it\u2019s working, because you\u2019re starting to seriously consider going through with this plan.\n\n\n\nEventually you get to the hospital and you tell Hans you\u2019ll be out as soon as possible. It\u2019s the graveyard shift so you don\u2019t run into too many people you know that ask questions. In fact nobody really pays too much attention to you at all, but you decide to play it safe and head down to the supply room in the basement to take what you need.\n\n\n\nAfter grabbing a few syringes, disinfectants, bandages and the like, you break the lock of the cabinet with the pharmaceutical supplies. You grab the pain killers immediately, but then you look for something that might help you with the other problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cIncitahol? What the hell?\u201d you say to yourself, picking up the small vial. This stuff shouldn\u2019t even be mixed in with the regular drugs. It\u2019s a powerful experimental concoction! It was supposed to be a \u201cmiracle\u201d drug that increased the body\u2019s natural healing ability even greater than that of mountain trolls and was first used on dying patients. Unfortunately what the drug really did was the speed up the death process and bring them back as zombies. It was banned by most civilized places and is highly sought out by lazy necromancers who don\u2019t have the natural ability to raise hordes of undead.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019d worry more about finding this if you didn\u2019t have your own drama going on right now. In fact this would probably be the perfect thing to take with you. Incitahol doesn\u2019t cause pain and quickly puts the patient into a coma and death follows soon after. (And then it\u2019s zombie time) You\u2019ll have to explain some of this to Hans though so he\u2019s prepared.\n\n\n\nPart of you wonders if you should really go through with all this though. There\u2019s no guarantee that Hans is telling you the truth and you might be just trading one master for another. In fact he might just blame you for everything and have you killed when he takes power.\n\n\n\nOf course another way to handle this is to inject this stuff into Edmond and not tell him what\u2019s going to happen. Chances are undead Ed might kill everyone nearby. Incitahol does increase the reflexes and strength after death making for a rather lively zombie.

He\u2019ll slowly lapse into a coma and then die. Then he\u2019ll come back as a zombie and most likely a very lively and hostile one.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting. Okay. Good. That lizard will probably be by his side the whole time. When Edmond comes back he\u2019ll probably try to attack his lizard who will defend himself and then the rest takes care of itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re glad Hans sounds pleased with this plan, the only thing you have to do now is pull off the deception. Eventually you get back to the tavern where Reg and several other Talon members are waiting.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck took you so damn long? Edmond could\u2019ve died already!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d You reply and head to his office.\n\n\n\nYou enter the office and the Sotakan assassin is holding a dagger to your throat already.\n\n\n\n\u201cDown boy, it\u2019s the doc...ugh\u2026what the fuck took you so long? I\u2019m dying over here!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Sotakan releases you and you run over to Edmond who is now lying on the floor still clutching his side.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you this shot first, it\u2019ll help as an anti-biotic and to ease the pain. You might start getting sleepy though, do you someplace more comfortable to lay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess the sofa.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou Help Edmond to the sofa and give him the shot of Incitahol. You then begin sewing him up as quickly as possible. Normally you\u2019d do a better job and extract the shrapnel in his body, but you figure he\u2019s going to be dead soon anyway and you need to get out of here before he starts turning.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you go. You should be good now, but you\u2019ll need to rest and not move too much for a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Yawn) Not a problem. I\u2019ll probably just take care of business from here for the time being. As long I got my Sotakan whatchin\u2019 my back, I\u2019ll be fine. Damn, that shit kicks in really quick. I don\u2019t feel anything\u2026.(Yawn) Glad you could help out doc\u2026be sure to stick around\u2026(Yawn) might have some work for you in the\u2026zzzzzzzzzz\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou stand away from Edmond, give a nod to the Sotakan and then leave quickly.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo is he asleep?\u201d Edmond asks walking up to you.\n\n\u201cYeah, won\u2019t be long\u2026hey where\u2019s that Reg guy?\u201d you say noticing a difference in some of the personnel hanging around the bar now.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, you just take a seat at that table over there. If need anything just let Wallace know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know what\u2019s going to happen and I\u2019m not a fighter. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need me here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. Given what\u2019s going to go down, we might still need a doctor soon. Besides having a doctor around in the future might be useful. Sit down, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou get the impression you don\u2019t have any choice in the matter, so you do what Hans says. You curse yourself for believing him. You have indeed traded one master for another.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould I have a drink?\u201d you ask Wallace, who looks less than pleased about you barking orders at him, but he gets you a bottle of strong whiskey before going to talk to his brother.\n\n\n\nTime passes and as you slowly get more drunk a loud noise is heard from Edmond\u2019s office. It\u2019s a mixture of hissing, moaning and loud crashing.\n\n\n\n\u201cHah! Sounds like he\u2019s (hic!) up!\u201d you slur while taking another drink. At this point Hans, Wallace and several other thugs rush into the office. You hear a bunch of yelling, fighting, and gunshots, but you just continue to drink the whole time.\n\n\n\n\u201cDis is yer fate mr. smart ass doctor, now you gotta (hic!) get yoost to it.\u201d You say to your self while looking at the bottle.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it worth it?\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point Hans exits Edmond\u2019s office looking a bit winded. He\u2019s followed by Wallace and one of the other thugs that lived.\n\n\n\n\u201cShit, it\u2019s a good thing that lizard had been preoccupied with Edmond. I can say with all honesty he put up a damn good fight even with a couple of bites in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou chopped his head off I (hic!) hope!\u201d you exclaim.\n\n\u201cYeah, of course I know the stories of the dead infection. Sheesh doc, I think you\u2019ve had enough for the night.\u201d Hans remarks.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t begun to drink!\u201d you shout and then promptly pass out in the tavern.\n\n\n\nWhile this would be the first time you passed out in the Troll\u2019s Breath Tavern, it wouldn\u2019t be the last. After this night, your life takes a drastic turn.\n\n\n\nYour hospital career begins to take a slow but sure nosedive, though your \u201ccareer\u201d as a Crimson doc begins to pick up a lot. Hans has a lot more trouble establishing order over the Crimson Talons than he thought he would. You end up doing a lot of after hours surgery. To Hans\u2019 credit he pays you well and you get free drinks whenever you can.\n\n\n\nEventually your mother knows something is going on with you, she isn\u2019t sure what (and doesn\u2019t really want to either), but she knows it isn\u2019t good. Having no real reason to stay any longer, she finally sells the inn to the city and moves back to Teckleville. She mentions when you get your life together you can visit her, until that time, stay away.\n\n\n\nYou never see her again.\n\n\n\nFrom there your life becomes a downward spiral and your drinking increases to cope with your situation. As the years go on, the hospital can\u2019t tolerate your sub par work due to a combination of drink and lack of proper sleep. Getting fired is bad enough, but you also lose your license and are lucky not to go to jail for malpractice.\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t really matter to you at this point, you just embrace the whole criminal lifestyle and work for Hans full time. The only problem is, he\u2019s getting sick of your sub-par work as well. Your situation becomes very much like the doctor who once worked Edmond.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really need to be said that your fate is very similar to his as well.\n\n\n\nOne night during a poker game you\u2019re on a rare winning streak and drinking heavily as usual. Your obnoxious bragging gets on the nerves of several Crimson Talon members who have already been told on several occasions by Hans that your usefulness is soon coming to an end. They decide that tonight is the night.\n\n\n\nAs you try to stumble your way home in the dark, a crushing blow knocks you to the street followed by several sharp piecing to your body. Fortunately you\u2019re so damn drunk that the pain is somewhat nonexistent. You mumble something incoherent and then pass out forever.\n\n\n\nYour winnings are taken back and your body sold to a bodylegger for spare parts.

He\u2019s likely to stay in power long enough for you to get trapped in this life and his successor is just going to insist on your services. That\u2019s even assuming you live that long, being connected to organized crime isn\u2019t necessarily a safe way to live if you don\u2019t have the street cred and stomach for it.\n\n\n\nYou need to get rid of Hans as well and hopefully not telling him what you\u2019re exactly going to do will create that opportunity.\n\n\n\nWhen you leave the hospital you enter the carriage, which is waiting for you across the street.\n\n\n\n\u201cI trust you got everything you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I found something perfect to take care of our problem.

What if something gets out of hand and you suddenly got a bunch of zombies hungry for flesh?

You can only guess that Frank or his demon girls have had something to do with this. The problem is that you can\u2019t really do anything about it.

But I suppose I have no choice as the Flying Griffon is filled up tonight\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFlying Griffon\u2026Flying Griffon\u2026\u201d you say with a smile before you grab the merchant by his throat.\n\n\u201cHey, ulp!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like the Flying fucking Griffon so much well get the fuck outta here and sleep in their doorway you fat piece of shit!\u201d you shout, releasing the merchant roughly so he falls to the floor dropping his coins all over the place. Everyone in the place stops what they\u2019re doing to watch your outburst.\n\n\n\nAs the merchant tries to get up and collect his dropped possessions, you grab your dad\u2019s Troll Gun and point it at him telling him to hurry up or you\u2019re going to blow his head off. At this point several of the Klyton Militia customers tell you to calm down and draw their own weapons, some of which have small flintlock pistols of their own. You mother and several of your staff pleads with you to calm down.\n\n\n\nIt works and the merchant leaves the inn as quickly as possible along with several other customers. The only ones who stay are the militia who insist that you hand over your weapon or they\u2019ll actually arrest you. You comply and state you have to go lie down. When you get to your room you collapse on your bed and fall asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up the next day, you feel like you\u2019re in a daze. You aren\u2019t sure how you\u2019re going to proceed, but your mother has already stepped in for you.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re selling the inn?\u201d you say with a sense of familiarity.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m selling this place, it\u2019s going to be the best thing for both of us! Especially you!\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit! You just don\u2019t want to be here anymore! You\u2019ve said it yourself! If you really cared about me, you\u2019d try to help me with finishing my education. You know like YOU and DAD wanted me to? But why bother right? It was all fucked from the moment dad ran out of money and had to borrow from a loanshark. I never had a chance.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point your mother takes your hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cSon, I\u2019m sorry. We really tried the best we could. We really did want the best for you, but maybe we just aimed too high and as a result you had a lot of pressure on you. I never thought I\u2019d ever see you pull a gun on someone in anger. It was scary to see that side of you because I didn\u2019t raise you to be that way. So I\u2019m going to do the only thing I can think of to help you. I\u2019m selling this inn and you can have ALL of the money I get from it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be enough that you\u2019ll be able to finish up your classes, but maybe it\u2019ll help. Now doesn\u2019t that sound a little easier?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou have to admit, it does though you\u2019re still concerned about finances. Proper medical school is still really expensive, but you guess you\u2019ll figure something out.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just want you to know that if something doesn\u2019t work out though, that you\u2019ll always be welcome at your aunt\u2019s house in Teckleville where I\u2019m going to stay. I love you.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou and your mom hug and at that point you feel a little weight lifted off your shoulders.\n\n\n\nYour mother ends up selling the inn to Frank, the owner of the Flying Griffon. He mentions that he\u2019s a little surprised at the offer considering the new additions built onto the Traveller\u2019s Inn, but he\u2019s willing to pay more than the city will. It\u2019s a lot, but not enough for medical school.\n\n\n\nYou decide maybe while you can\u2019t be a doctor, maybe you can still choose something in medical field, presumably something you\u2019ll be able to afford and not be as stressed all the time.\n\n\n\nYou ultimately become a veterinarian and feel a great sense of accomplishment. The only problem is they aren\u2019t in great demand in Klyton and the few that do exist in the city have the market pretty much cornered, but you do know of a place where they might need one\u2026\n\n\n\nYou move to Teckleville where you make a living treating farm animals and pets like kitties and puppies. Occasionally someone has something more exotic like a purple tailed glittermane, but it\u2019s a quiet life for the most part. You eventually have a family and live the rest of your days there.\n\n\n\nSometimes you wonder what would\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d done things a bit differently at the inn, but all things considered it worked out.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go with Wendy's idea", "result": "Wendy\u2019s idea requires almost no effort on your part and she\u2019s right, if they are doing something illegal like Eliza suggested then the unexpected militia inspection should catch them off guard and in the act.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay let\u2019s get some of our militia buddies to help us.\u201d You say.\n\n\n\nWendy smiles and says she\u2019s on good terms with one of the sergeants that drinks here and can easily persuade him to help. You mother doesn\u2019t exactly approve of this and Rita\u2019s not thrilled with you picking Wendy\u2019s idea over hers, but everyone goes along with it.\n\n\n\nLater, Wendy speaks with Sergeant Keller, who is drinking with a few of his men at a corner table. You watch from the distance at get the impression that something more is going on between Wendy and the Sergeant, but whatever works right?\n\n\n\nWendy comes back with a slight smile on her face.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019ll do it, but not for free. He wants at least fifty silvers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says that while he\u2019d love to just harass people on a daily basis he really can\u2019t go around abusing his position like that, at least not without a little incentive.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Yeah, yeah I get it, everyone\u2019s gotta get paid. Fine, let me get it from the back, but for that amount of money he better do a good job.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou pay off the militia and get on with your work for the rest of night. You fully expect them to show up towards closing time, but they never do. Wendy says that maybe they did find something that they made a bunch of arrests. Of course if that was the case, it seems like Keller might\u2019ve sent someone back to at least tell you. You\u2019re hoping they just didn\u2019t pocket the money, but Wendy assures you that Keller wouldn\u2019t have done that.\n\n\n\nThe next day after you get back from class and ready for another grueling day at the inn, you ask Wendy what\u2019s the status on the Flying Griffon and Keller. She says she doesn\u2019t know and that she hasn\u2019t seen him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! Are you kidding me? I know you two got something going on and you\u2019re saying you haven\u2019t seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I said! We\u2019re not fucking married alright? He\u2019s a damn militia man, he might\u2019ve gotten assigned to the Cloudspeak Mountains and his head smashed in by a troll for all I know!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho got their head smashed in by troll?\u201d a familiar voice asks.\n\n\n\nWendy and you turn to look and see Sergeant Keller with his men.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?! I was worried!\u201d Wendy exclaims, running to him.\n\n\u201cJust on business, m\u2019love. No need to worry, I\u2019m here now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that still doesn\u2019t answer the question, where have you been? I paid a lot of money, I would\u2019ve appreciated someone telling what exactly happened at the Flying Griffon last night.\u201d You demand causing Sergeant Keller\u2019s eyes to narrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing happened. And I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. In fact I\u2019ve gotten some reports about this place and I\u2019m afraid I need to search it. Please cooperate and things will go smoother.\u201d Keller says as his men start spreading out to search the place.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck Keller?! Did Frank pay you more money or something?! You fucking sonofabitch!\u201d you shout.\n\n\u201cI said mind your tone kid, or I\u2019ll arrest you for interference with an investigation.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour mom soon comes out of the kitchen and your remaining guests start wondering what\u2019s going on as they\u2019re being pushed out of their rooms.\n\n\n\n\u201cSon, what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s militia looking all through the kitchen and the cellar!\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently Keller\u2019s a double crossing bastard that\u2019s what\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNow hold on! I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a perfectly good explanation for all this!\u201d Wendy says trying to defend him.\n\n\u201cHey Sergeant! We got something here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point one his men comes out with a container that contains several Cloudspeak Rock.\n\n\n\n\u201cNO! NO! NO FUCKING WAY! You planted that shit there!\u201d you protest.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in there!\u201d your Mom adds\n\n\u201cOh my!\u201d Eliza says.\n\n\n\nKeller looks at the container and shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Y\u2019know I\u2019ve been coming here for awhile now, and I can\u2019t believe that this going on the whole time\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNow wait a minute! You can\u2019t honestly believe that we were all selling illegal drugs!\u201d Wendy says.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe you were. But I do believe they were.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuddenly four of Keller\u2019s men apprehend you and your mother. There\u2019s a lot of protesting and fighting, but of course this only makes things worse. You end up getting a mace to your head and when you wake up you\u2019re in a jail cell with almost all of your staff.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d you say rubbing your head and sitting up from the cell floor.\n\n\u201cKeller\u2019s gone fucking crazy that\u2019s what and that bitch Wendy is backing him up to save her own ass! I told you we should\u2019ve just went with my plan!\u201d Rita yells.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in here? Last thing I remember they took me and mom in for those drugs they claimed we were selling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell they decided to trump up the charges of illegal prostitution as well, so they took in me and those two half elven sluts over there. Yeah right like if I was a prostitute, they\u2019d even be in the same league as me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh fuck you Rita.\u201d Sunshine says, while Flameflower gives Rita the finger.\n\n\u201cEven Eliza?\u201d you say in disbelief at all this.\n\n\u201cUm, no. I\u2019m here for assault. I knocked out one of Keller\u2019s men when they were taking you and your mother away. I didn\u2019t mean to, I just got so angry at this great injustice.\u201d Eliza says.\n\n\u201cHeh, thanks I guess.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou get off the floor and go sit over with your mother who\u2019s been silent the whole time.\n\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have too much to say except that assuming that she doesn\u2019t go to prison, she\u2019s getting the hell out of Klyton. She apologizes to you that you won\u2019t get to achieve your goal, but at this point you\u2019re just worried about not going to prison too.\n\n\n\nEventually all of you are released after a couple days. Rita, Flameflower and Sunshine are all given a warning. Eliza somehow manages to avoid real prosecution for assaulting a guard, but for whatever reason she doesn\u2019t get any further punishment.\n\n\n\nYou and your mother aren\u2019t quite as lucky. You don\u2019t have to serve any time fortunately, but the inn is taken away from you and given to the city of Klyton as reparations for your \u201ccrimes\u201d against it.\n\n\n\nWell that\u2019s it then. An end to you future in Klyton. You and your mother have little choice but to move to Teckleville now. And that\u2019s where you go.\n\n\n\nYour aunt Enora is happy to see you both, and while this whole living with her thing was sprung on her at the last moment it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her. She says there\u2019s plenty of room and you can stay as long as you like.\n\n\n\nWhile the house is certainly nice and you\u2019re happy to live there rather than in the street, it\u2019s sort of on the small side and you feel like you have no privacy. Teckleville isn\u2019t anything like you\u2019re used to either. The whole small town thing just doesn\u2019t appeal to you, and you feel trapped with a bunch of boring backwards people.\n\n\n\nYou were supposed to do greater things! You were going to be a doctor! You did everything right and studied hard and what do you have to show for it? Nothing! You\u2019re stuck in some cow town where the best job you can hope to get is probably shoveling shit. Some future.\n\n\n\nIn time, your mother works at the local tavern where she serves as a cook. It\u2019s not much, but it is something she\u2019s used to doing.\n\n\n\nYou manage to get a job working as an assistant to the mean old bastard who runs the general store. It\u2019s a thankless job, but he\u2019s about the only one who\u2019ll hire you since nobody else will work for him and everyone else thinks you have a superiority complex (Which is sort of true) and won\u2019t hire you.\n\n\n\nThe only upside is since you live at your aunt\u2019s house you manage to save what little money you do make and eventually get a place of your own. You always think about moving to the Delantium Kingdom and start fresh again, but you never do.\n\n\n\nYou basically remain in Teckleville where you eventually take over running the general store when the mean old bastard dies, where upon you become the new mean old bastard who runs the general store until you die as well.\n\n\n\nYou often think back about what went wrong at the inn and what might\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d done things differently, but you\u2019ll never know.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go with Eliza's idea", "result": " \n\nEliza\u2019s idea might be a little complicated, but if you\u2019re going sic the Klyton militia on Frank for something, you\u2019d better at least have some sort of evidence to back it up, real or imagined.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay Eliza, we\u2019ll go with your plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rita exclaims.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Wendy adds.\n\n\u201c Oh, um really?\u201d Eliza says just as surprised as everyone.\n\n\u201cSure and you\u2019re going to be the one to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I couldn\u2019t\u2026I\u2019m far too shy!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh for\u2026if you\u2019re going to insist on doing this plan, you\u2019ll need someone who can work a room. Of course I\u2019ll expect to be paid extra for this.\u201d Rita volunteers.\n\n\u201cOh I can see this plan is a GREAT idea.\u201d Wendy says rolling her eyes.\n\n\u201cEveryone be quiet! I\u2019m not using you Rita because quite frankly too many people already know who you are and you\u2019re too obvious. Eliza needs to do it. She\u2019s practically invisible. No offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh none taken, but I just don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you can, you came up with the idea right? We just need to hammer out the details.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments of discussion, Eliza says that the easiest way would be to get hired there as a waitress. If Frank questions her, she\u2019ll say that she didn\u2019t like the environment at your place and her co-workers (especially Rita). It should be enough to convince him, but Eliza\u2019s just worried that she won\u2019t get hired due to her looks. She\u2019s a pretty a girl, but she suffers from low self esteem so you try to boost her up a bit with compliments. Hopefully they work and hopefully this plan works.\n\n\n\nA few days later the plan is in motion. Eliza \u201cquits\u201d working at your Inn and works for Frank. In your first secret meeting, she tells you he did know who she was, but apparently he didn\u2019t even question her that much. He was too overjoyed that he was taking help away from you that he hired her right away. Though you wonder if that could be a ruse to lull her into some sort of trap, you tell her to be very cautious.\n\n\n\nThe next time you meet Eliza she\u2019s dressed a lot more provocatively than usual. You can\u2019t help but to comment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWow, Eliza that uh dress\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. It doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination does it? I feel like I\u2019m almost walking around naked and everyone is looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it, they were looking even before you dressed like that. You are very attractive after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t need to boost me up anymore, I\u2019m getting over my shyness, though I suppose I don\u2019t have much choice. Now here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found out so far\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nEliza goes on to say that other than having a lot of beautiful girls working for him she hasn\u2019t found anything out of the ordinary yet. He doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in any illegal activity either.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t any prostitution going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the first thing I thought of, but it doesn\u2019t look like it. None of the other waitresses are sneaking off with the patrons to some backroom and I haven\u2019t been asked to do anything unseemly either.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn\u2026uh I mean that\u2019s good you weren\u2019t put in that position though. So nothing at all huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the only thing that I noticed that might be odd is two of the girls always seem to be there all the time and sometimes they go off with Frank in the basement for long periods of time. There are rumors that they\u2019re sleeping with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sleeping with the boss might be sleazy, but it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cI dunno if it\u2019s that sleazy, I think people can maintain a healthy relationship even if one is in a higher position than the other.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis odd little quip from Eliza puts you off guard for a moment.\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, well sure, but I doubt if that\u2019s the case with those three.\u201d You sputter.\n\n\u201cOh I agree, but the thing is, I get the impression it isn\u2019t necessarily sex. It feels like something else is going on with them. I think it\u2019s still worthwhile to stick around a little longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but as I\u2019ve said before, be very careful. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone there to find out about you, you\u2019re the only employee I have that doesn\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, but thanks for your concern.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou suddenly feel the need to \u201ccorrect\u201d yourself.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean I only care about you as an employee, I mean I also care about you\u2026I mean as a person! Y\u2019know, I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d You awkwardly word.\n\n\u201cI know what you mean. And thanks again I appreciate it.\u201d Eliza says with a smile.\n\n\n\nYou tell her the next time you want to meet, but if she finds out anything really important to come to you earlier. As she begins to leave you realize you are starting to develop some feelings for Eliza, though you aren\u2019t sure if she feels the same way, but you get the impression that she has also been dropping a few hints.", "action_results": [{"action": "Say something", "result": "Things don\u2019t get accomplished by sitting around doing nothing. You have to seize the day! You stand up from your seat and call out to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cEliza!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like you! Do you like me?\u201d\n\n\n\nNot exactly the most mature way of \u201cseizing the day\u201d but fortunately for you Eliza is easily amused and she isn\u2019t without her own feelings towards you.\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments of talking the pair of you both realize you can\u2019t really do anything major with this relationship now, but after all this spying business is over with you\u2019ll be able to.\n\n\n\nExcept that doesn\u2019t really happen and the pair of you are meeting a lot more frequently.\n\n\n\nA month passes and Wendy begins to grumble about being short staffed and wonder when the hell Eliza is coming back.\n\n\n\n\u201cEliza\u2019s doing important work and I\u2019m sick of hearing criticism about her, so just suck it up and work harder.\u201d You tell Wendy\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? I work like a fucking Dwarven Shieldmaiden around here!\u201d Wendy exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Rita does any damn work except sit around and look pretty, and as for those two halfbreed sluts I have to practically light a fire under their asses in order to get them to do anything. Eliza was the only one who I could reliably count on and now I don\u2019t even have her because she\u2019s fucking you!\u201d\n\n\u201cHEY! Watch who the hell you\u2019re talking to!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr what? It\u2019s true isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed the increase in your little meetings with her. Far be it from me to get in the way of young love and all that, but it\u2019s starting to interfere with MY life. Tell me has she even found anything to incriminate Frank yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell no, but she says there\u2019s still a lot of suspicious stuff going on. She says she thinks she might be on to something soon.\u201d\n\nWendy just shakes her head. \u201cI told you we should\u2019ve just gone with my plan. I\u2019m telling you right now though, I\u2019m not going to put up with being overworked too much longer, so if you expect me to stick around, you better stop playing so much grab ass with her so she can concentrate on her real job.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile Wendy\u2019s words give you something to consider, they\u2019re a little too late. A few days later while you\u2019re going to one of your classes you run into Frank of all people on campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this is what college is like eh? I believe I probably would\u2019ve liked going to this institution. Having more knowledge is always a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, what I\u2019m doing here, let\u2019s walk and talk, wouldn\u2019t want you to be late for class and all.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou slowly walk with Frank while having a sickening feeling about this whole surprise visit.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay m\u2019boy let\u2019s get right to it since you\u2019re obviously about to vomit. I know all about Eliza, quite honestly I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t pick up on her reasons for being there in the first place. Stupidness on my part, I suppose I was blinded by the idea that my inn was finally starting to gain more customers again\u2026but this isn\u2019t about my stupidity, it\u2019s about yours.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou stop for a moment as you begin to feel sick to the point that you\u2019re dry heaving.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh for\u2026alright I better tell you the good news first before you make a damn scene. Eliza is fine\u2026for now. Anyway let me get to the point. Your inn is mine now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell your mother\u2019s inn then, or whoever owns it. I\u2019m not unreasonable so I will buy it for a fair price.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, you just want me to hand over the inn to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I said I was offering to buy it\u2026that is unless you don\u2019t really care about your precious Eliza after all.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point you get angry and grab Frank by the collar with both hands, causing several passersby to avoid the pair of you. Frank isn\u2019t at all intimidated though.\n\n\n\n\u201cAttempting to beat the hell out of me isn\u2019t going to improve your situation m\u2019boy. Look you need to just accept the fact that you\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s obvious you have feelings for Eliza, so the logical thing to do is to sell your inn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have friends in the Klyton militia, I could just have them storm your place!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could I suppose, but not in time to save Eliza, not to mention that plan might not work out like you think. I have friends of my own too, much more powerful than the Klyton militia.\u201d Frank\u2019s expression is quite serious at this point.\n\n\n\nLacking any other ideas, you feebly attempt to bluff.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026well maybe\u2026Eliza will have to be sacrificed for the good of the inn\u2026or\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m surprised you actually managed to say it, even if you don\u2019t mean it. Even if you were serious, I doubt that even you would want to sacrifice your own child within her.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe shock of this revelation leaves you speechless.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm, didn\u2019t tell you then? She\u2019s not far along and obviously not showing yet but trust me I know. It\u2019s one of the reasons why you\u2019re getting this special generous deal. I\u2019m not exactly heartless even though you probably think I\u2019m being a complete bastard right now. Well I suppose I\u2019ll leave you to it, I imagine you\u2019ll need lots of time to get your stuff in order.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou heart sinks, there\u2019s no way out of this. You\u2019ll have to tell your mother everything and this is definitely going to put an end to your college pursuits for a long time.\n\n\n\nThe transfer isn\u2019t complicated. Your mother isn\u2019t exactly happy about how you bungled all this, but she isn\u2019t willing to sacrifice her future grandchild. Not to mention she was only continuing to help with the inn due to your college fees. She\u2019s been tired of living in Klyton ever since your father died.\n\n\n\nWhen you and your mother meet Frank at his inn, he has a couple of his waitresses to get Eliza. She looks none the worse for wear. Frank assures you that apart from keeping her locked up in one of his rooms nothing was done to her.\n\n\n\nIn the following months you eventually marry Eliza and get a job as a lowly clerk filing away insignificant papers and other dull material. You move into a modest apartment and manage to get settled in fairly well due to the money your mother got from selling the inn. She gave most of it to you since she moved to Teckleville to live with her sister Enora.\n\n\n\nIn the months that follow, Eliza finally gives birth to your daughter. You find yourself working a lot and while you aren\u2019t completely unhappy, you begin to feel a sense of dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\nIn the years that follow you\u2019re beginning to feel burned out, you wonder if moving to Teckleville wouldn\u2019t be a good idea, but Eliza says that you wouldn\u2019t be find work there, or at least not the kind that pays well enough to support all of you. You and her begin to argue a lot, mostly over money and how you never seem to have enough of it.\n\n\n\nAnother decade and you\u2019re practically miserable. You\u2019re working at a job that you hate, you live with a wife that you\u2019ve fallen out of love with and you now have two children that are barely obedient.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably just as well that you suddenly suffer from a heart attack due to all the stress. Any longer and you probably would\u2019ve snapped and went on a killing spree.\n\n\n\nIn your last moments you wonder back to your days at the inn and if you could\u2019ve avoided all this had you done things differently there.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll never know.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave it alone", "result": "Whatever feelings either of you might have need to be put aside and left alone at least until she\u2019s done with this mission. She needs to focus.\n\n\n\nA month passes and Wendy begins to grumble about being short staffed and wonder when the hell Eliza is coming back.\n\n\n\n\u201cEliza\u2019s doing important work, just hang in there. She\u2019ll be back here on a regular basis soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell she better. Dunno why you went with her plan anyway, it would\u2019ve been easier to go with mine.\u201d Wendy says.\n\n\u201cMaybe, but I wanted to have some extra leverage on Frank if we\u2019re going to report him to our militia friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour gamble pays off, a few days later. Eliza comes running into the inn with something bundled under one of her arms and looking more than a little nervous. She says she needs to talk to you immediately and how important it is. You comply and head to the kitchen where your mother is, since she probably needs to know whatever Eliza has to say as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cDemons\u2026Frank\u2019s in league with demons!\u201d Eliza blurts out.\n\n\u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYes! I was in his wine cellar getting a special bottle for one of his wealthy merchant customers when a rat passed by and startled me. This caused me to jump back and I hit the wall, but in doing so I must\u2019ve hit some sort of secret button because the wall opened up into a small room. There was blood on the floor, a few bones, and a bunch of symbols drawn everywhere. The thing that stood out though was this!\u201d\n\n\n\nEliza drops the bundle on the kitchen table and unwraps the cloth she\u2019s put it in to reveal a large leather bound book with a few symbols written on it. If it isn\u2019t a spell book, it sure looks like one.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I suppose we now know Frank\u2019s an unlicensed mage, but are you sure about the demons?\u201d Your mother asks.\n\n\u201cYes! I\u2019ve seen them! I mean everyone has, they just don\u2019t know!\u201d Eliza exclaims. \u201cWhen I was leaving with the book and closing the secret door, two of the waitresses I work with confronted me. When they showed me their true forms, I was scared for my life. These two in particular had always made me a little nervous. They just had an odd aura about them, never imagined that they were demons though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t try to do anything to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they just said that I was very lucky Frank neglected to be thorough when drawing up his contract with them. I think they saw me as a potential loophole out of their service to him. I know they never really seemed fond of Frank.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell whatever the reason, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe. I suppose now we should go inform the Klyton militia.\u201d You say.\n\n\n\nAfter bringing the book to Klyton sergeant and Eliza repeating her story to them, they take action immediately. Unlicensed magery is a very series offense, let alone cavorting with demons.\n\n\n\nNaturally you don\u2019t witness the raid; in fact the Klyton militia tries its best to section off the area beforehand, but given that Frank\u2019s place is in a high traffic area and is already pretty popular, it\u2019s not an entirely successful endeavor. A group of heavily armed Klyton militia with sanctioned wizards as support tends to draw attention. Fortunately it doesn\u2019t end in a big explosion and hundreds dead. It ends with a few smaller explosions and only a couple dozen dead instead. Unfortunately it also ends with the one of the demons escaping as well. For a while there\u2019s a lock down on the entire city as the Klyton militia tries to maintain order as well as searching for the thing, eventually nothing comes of it and it is assumed that the succubus flew away to a place where it could hunt for new prey a lot easier. (Probably Hessla).\n\n\n\nDuring this time, the inn was pretty busy since several merchants couldn\u2019t leave the city right away, not to mention some of the regulars drinking a little more to calm themselves of a possible demon running around, so it works out for you pretty well.\n\n\n\nAfter everything is said and done, you have enough money to continue your education and with this financial pressure off, you easily pass the rest of your classes with no worries.\n\n\n\nOf course now you\u2019re in your final stages of your education, which means medical school as well as actually having to get a job actually working at a hospital. The only problem with that is being an intern doesn\u2019t pay all that well and you certainly can\u2019t do that AND work at the bar. Your mother reassures you that you shouldn\u2019t worry about it as she\u2019ll be able to hire a couple extra people as well as being able to help with the rest of your tuition.\n\n\n\nIn any case it looks like your days as an innkeeper are over.", "action_results": [{"action": "Future Plans", "result": "A few years have passed and your medical schooling is complete and you now work at the Klyton hospital as a real doctor.\n\n\n\nYour personal life has changed quite a bit over the past few years as well. You currently live in an apartment near the hospital with a fellow medical student. Actually she\u2019s your girlfriend. It started out as a simple roommates thing, but then it developed into something a little more. Cindy still has a year of schooling to go, and you now have a job at the hospital so you weren\u2019t planning on going anywhere just yet.\n\n\n\nHowever Cindy suggests that the pair of you should leave for the Delantium Kingdom, specifically Sivak, which is the closest big city. She mentions that there are more opportunities there and she would prefer living there as well.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any specific objections against going there, it\u2019s just you\u2019ve never left Klyton, so you\u2019re probably a little nervous especially since you\u2019ve managed to succeed in getting a good job here and maintain a friendly relationship with most of the people you work beside.\n\n\n\nWell you have a year to hammer out all the plans in the meantime you\u2019re on your way to visit your mother. You don\u2019t see her as much as you used to but she is of course very proud of you and mentions that your father would be too if he were still alive. After all it was always his goal to make sure that you went into medicine for a career.\n\n\n\nWhen you get to the Traveler\u2019s Inn, it never ceases to amaze you how much the place has changed and how much it has grown since the days when you were little. Wendy does most of the day to day inn management nowadays, leaving your mom to concentrate on the cooking, which she prefers in the first place. Rita still works there surprisingly enough. Apparently she found it a lot better to just hook up with various rich guys for a short period of time to get some gifts and then remain single.\n\n\n\nEliza is the new head barmaid. You guess that experience with the whole Griffon Inn situation boosted her confidence. She even managed to turn Flameflower and Sunshine into productive employees! You remember how friendly you were to each other and how sometimes it seemed like there was the potential for more there, but neither one of you seriously pursued it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, haven\u2019t seen you in awhile Mr. big shot doctor. You still with that\u2026girl?\u201d Rita asks when you walk in.\n\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Cindy and yes I am, Rita. What\u2019s it to you anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, can\u2019t I be concerned for your well being? I mean we have known each other for a long time and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm. Well I\u2019m fine. Where\u2019s my mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in the kitchen as usual.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou walk past Rita, shaking your head at her sudden interest in you now that you have a good paying job. As you approach the bar, Wendy notices you.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see the great doctor has come for a visit. Taking a break from that girl you shacked up with huh? Anyway your mom is in the kitchen.\u201d She says and then goes back to talking with some of the patrons.\n\n\n\nWhen you enter the kitchen your mom turns around to see you and smiles before rushing to give you a big hug.\n\n\n\n\u201cAw mom.\u201d You say not wanting all this fuss.\n\n\u201cHey indulge me, I don\u2019t get to see you as much as I used to. So how have you been? What\u2019s going on? Are you still with\u2026that girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Cindy, geez why doesn\u2019t anyone like her? Rita and Wendy both made some snide remark about her as I came walking in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry son, I\u2019m sure Cindy\u2019s a nice girl and all, but the couple times you visited here with her, she was a bit pretentious, and you know Wendy doesn\u2019t care for people like that. As for Rita, well I\u2019m sure you know why she\u2019s acts the way she does by now.\u201d\n\n\u201c Okay I know Cindy has a bit of that upper class personality, but Eliza was the only one who even tried to be friendly with Cindy the last time she was here!\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza would be friendly to a mountain troll as long as it wasn\u2019t eating her. It\u2019s just her nature. Not to mention she thinks you\u2019re happy with Cindy so she\u2019s happy for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, why can\u2019t you be happy for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said I wasn\u2019t? If that\u2019s who you want then good! I\u2019m all for it. The question though is are you happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am! I wouldn\u2019t be moving with her to Sivak by next year if I wasn\u2019t! That\u2019s sort of why I came here today. I wanted to let you know, I\u2019ll be leaving Klyton soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou mother doesn\u2019t seem too emotional about this revelation, you were sort of expecting more tears or celebration. Instead she just sighs and heads off to cut some vegetables, before speaking again.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm, okay. Well as long as you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it? I mean there are more opportunities in Sivak than there are here for me and Cindy. You didn\u2019t want me to stay did you? I thought you were going to sell this place and move to Teckleville anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t want you to stay for me! Geez, I can manage just fine. Your father and I always knew the day would come that you\u2019d move far away. As for selling this place, eh, I\u2019m not sure yet. It is true that after your father died, my main motivation was to keep this place running to help continue paying for your education. I figured after that goal was reached I would indeed retire to Teckleville. I dunno now though. I guess after all the stuff we went through to keep this place, not to mention making it better, I\u2019ve become more attached to it again.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow you\u2019re sort of surprised to hear her say that, you thought for sure that she was fully intending on moving back to Teckleville.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, no matter where you are, I hope you know I\u2019ll visit.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cOh of course, I wasn\u2019t worried about that. Well anyway I have to finish preparing this drakling. Some adventurers can\u2019t ever order something simple, well at least they brought it in themselves I suppose.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point you and your mother say goodbye to each other and you walk out of the kitchen. On your way out you bump into Eliza.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey you! I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time! How have you been? Are things going well for you and Cindy?\u201d\n\nYou smile at the fact that she remembered your girlfriend\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019ve been okay. I heard about you being the head waitress now, congratulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019m actually running a little late right now. I\u2019ll have to talk with you later, maybe we should meet sometime when we\u2019re not both busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah maybe. Well see you later.\u201d You say and quickly leave the area.\n\n\n\nAs you leave you feel a mixture of guilt, anxiety and confusion. Part of you wants to go back. You don\u2019t know if you have real feelings for Eliza or you\u2019re just deliberately thinking about sabotaging things so you don\u2019t have to move away from Klyton.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make plans to meet with Eliza", "result": "You go back to the inn.

I thought you had to talk to me.\u201d She says.\n\n\n\nYou turn around and nothing comes out. You just take one look at her face and you can\u2019t contain yourself. You grab and kiss her right on the lips. This is followed by a few cheers and claps from the patrons in the bar.\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh, took him long enough to realize it.\u201d Wendy says and goes back to cleaning the bar.\n\n\n\nEliza\u2019s response is pure shock. She doesn\u2019t know what to do except run into the ladies room. You call out to her before realizing you\u2019ve done this in front of several onlookers. You panic again and run into the kitchen.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there? Did I hear you call out Eliza\u2019s name? What did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026I fucked up\u2026\u201d you blurt out.\n\n\n\nYou quickly explain what just happened and your mother shakes her head while throwing a washcloth on the table.\n\n\n\n\u201c(Sigh) I KNEW something was up when you wanted to talk to her and were acting more jittery than a goblin caught in a troll\u2019s larder.

At least part of it, because you\u2019ll need to take care of the rest tonight when you talk to Cindy.\n\n\n\nYou sheepishly exit the kitchen wondering if everyone will be looking.

Our shipment is a little late. It was nice seeing you.\u201d She answers without looking in your direction.\n\n\u201cEliza we need to talk about what just happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should just forget about it. Shouldn\u2019t you be getting home? I\u2019m sure Cindy will be wondering about where you are.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point you grab Eliza again and tell the stock boy to leave, he doesn\u2019t seem to want to get involved in whatever drama you two have so he complies.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but we\u2019re gonna talk!\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about what?

Where the hell are those electro-gauntlets?\u201d\n\n\u201cNO, she can\u2019t die!\u201d you shout. \u201cHand me a syringe of Troll Adrenaline!\u201d\n\n\u201cTroll Adrenaline? Her body can\u2019t take that!\u201d a nurse says\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already fucking dying! Somebody gimme that syringe now!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou shove the syringe deep into her chest and inject the adenaline. This causes Eliza\u2019s body to begin to twitch violently and she even opens her eyes. She then spits up a mixture of blood and some sort of black fluid.\n\n\n\n\u201cHuuuuuuuuuu!\u201d Eliza wheezes\n\n\n\nA nurse rushes in with electro-gauntlets and you grab them immediately and lay your hands on Eliza\u2019s chest.\n\n\n\n\u201cCLEAR!\u201d\n\n\n\nBUZZ!\n\n\n\n\u201cCLEAR!\u201d\n\n\n\nBUZZ!\n\n\n\n\u201cCLEAR!\u201d\n\n\n\nBUZZ! SPARK! FWOOM!\n\n\n\nThe electro-gauntlets short out and you end up giving yourself a nasty zap causing you to fall to the floor. It doesn\u2019t take you long to realize the gauntlets are also on fire. You shake them off immediately. You smell the scent of burnt flesh and scramble back up to help Eliza who has now once again ceased to move.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh shit, shit! I\u2019m sorry Eliza! I\u2019m so fucking sorry!\u201d you say and begin pounding on her chest, but it\u2019s no use\n\n\n\n\u201cYou tried everything you could my boy, she\u2019s gone.\u201d The surgeon says trying to calm you down.\n\n\u201cNo, but look her foot just twitched, she\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat twitch was just an after effect of the troll adrenaline. (Sigh) Never gets easy losing a patient\u2026and I gather you knew this one personally?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026she\u2026yeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYou stumble out of the emergency room and see your mother who must\u2019ve been the one who brought her here.\n\n\n\n\u201cSon! Is Eliza\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter the funeral you take time off from work. Cindy tries to be sympathetic, but the fact that you feel really guilty over Eliza\u2019s death and incredibly broken up about it leads her to quite rightly think that you had stronger feelings for her than you let on. Ultimately Cindy breaks up with you and eventually moves back to the Delantium Kingdom by herself.\n\n\n\nEventually you go back to work and continue on with your life. You never do forgive yourself for Eliza\u2019s death though and immerse yourself in your work.\n\n\n\nAs for your family\u2019s inn, your mother continues to run it until the day she dies. You get the impression her concern for you caused her to stay rather than retire to Teckleville like she once planned. Upon her death you sell the inn, as you have no desire to run the place. The owner of a chain of inns from the Delantium Kingdom ends up buying it.\n\n\n\nDue to your focus on your job, you end up becoming a more dedicated doctor with many patients speaking highly of you. In time you even win an Excellence in Medicine Award. You graciously accept these awards and praise, but you always think back of what you should\u2019ve done differently to save the one life you feel directly responsible.\n\n\n\nYou think Eliza\u2019s suicide could\u2019ve been prevented if only you\u2019d kept your mouth shut that day. Or maybe you should\u2019ve pursued her harder. Or maybe you should\u2019ve done something else. You routinely mentally torture yourself with all the possible better ways you think you could\u2019ve handled things. As a result you never marry and place flowers on her grave site on a weekly basis.\n\n\n\nYour own death is a sudden one at home that comes to you many years later well into an age when you should\u2019ve long retired. When your body is found, your last request in your will is carried out. Your body is cremated and the ashes sprinkled over Eliza\u2019s grave.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Break up with Cindy", "result": "You have to go for this. Even if doesn\u2019t work out you\u2019ll always be wondering \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n\n\n\nBut before you can do anything, you have to break up with Cindy first. You aren\u2019t looking forward to it, but in a way you feel it\u2019s probably for the best no matter what happens with Eliza. You don\u2019t particularly want to move and you\u2019re happy where you\u2019re at right now. Cindy\u2019s been dominating your relationship since you\u2019ve been together and it\u2019s time to put an end to it.\n\n\n\nWhen you get home, Cindy\u2019s already there questioning where you\u2019ve been. You take a deep breath and say what\u2019s on your mind about her whole plan to move and how you\u2019re not into the idea. This of course has the predictable result of causing an argument, but Cindy\u2019s not an idiot. She KNOWS there is more to it than just the moving. She continues to press the issue of where you\u2019ve been before you came to tell her this new revelation.\n\n\n\nEventually you just tell her everything about how you also have feelings for Eliza. Cindy becomes very upset and even throws a few objects at you before attempting to hit you with her fists. You manage to fend her off long enough so she stops and just resorts to calling you every swear word in the human language (and a few in some other languages!) before starting to pack her belongings.\n\n\n\n\u201cCindy, I\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t want it to be like this, I just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it asshole. I can\u2019t believe I fell for you! I see now that you can take the boy out of the gutter, but you can\u2019t take the gutter out of the boy. I hope you and your trashy barmaid have a good life together because you certainly deserve each other. Oh and don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting away with this insult. My wrath will be terrible. This, I fucking vow dickhead!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd with that Cindy leaves while slamming the door of your apartment. It went about as well as you could\u2019ve expected. All you have to do now is talk to Eliza again. You figure you should probably give her a couple days before do so though.\n\n\n\nA few days pass and after work you head over to the inn.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s you. I suppose you\u2019re looking for Eliza, well she\u2019s here. Dunno where though. Y\u2019know, you should\u2019ve just tried to hook up with me instead. Hell I wouldn\u2019t have even cared if you still wanted to stay with Cindy.\u201d Rita says.\n\n\u201cYeah, just as long as I bought you something nice and expensive right? Sorry, I don\u2019t go for gold digging whores.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh fuck you, Mr. big shot doctor! Don\u2019t try to play moral superiority on me with all the drama you got going on!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t playing anything and none of this is about you anyway, despite the fact that you like to think everything is.\u201d You retort and leave.\n\n\n\nAfter a quick scan of the room, you don\u2019t see Eliza. You head over to the bar where Wendy is located.\n\n\n\n\u201cWendy where\u2019s Eliza?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back a lot earlier than I expected. You just cost me 20 coppers in the bet we had going. But nevermind all that, I\u2019d just like to say, that you really fucked up with how you handled this situation. I hope you\u2019ve at least had the sense to break over with that snooty bitch before trying this again.\u201d\n\n\u201cCindy\u2019s not\u2026\u201d you begin to say still feeling the need to defend her, but you stop yourself \u201c(Sigh) Yeah, yeah I did. And I\u2019m probably going to pay for it later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all pay for our mistakes in some way. She\u2019s in the kitchen. And hey! Be gentle with her, she\u2019s been upset for the past few days and in a fragile state right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou nod and enter the kitchen.\n\n\n\nUpon entering the kitchen all eyes turn to you. Eliza\u2019s, your mother\u2019s, the other workers you don\u2019t know, everyone. You half expect Eliza to run off again, but she doesn\u2019t in fact she seems ready to confront you.\n\n\n\n\u201cUm, Flameflower can you be in charge of the staff for a little while?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cCan I? I\u2019ve waited for this day to come!\u201d Flameflower gleefully says in semi-power drunk glee and then telling everyone to quickly get to work. Her sister Sunshine looks a little jealous. You knew Eliza had managed to instill a work ethic into them, but you didn\u2019t think either of them would jump on the chance for more responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you two are going to talk here at the inn, I suggest one of the empty rooms upstairs and I\u2019d rather you not cause such a scene this time.\u201d You mother says.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou and Eliza exit the kitchen through the back way.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey wait doesn\u2019t this lead to your family\u2019s living quarters?\u201d Eliza asks.\n\n\u201cYeah, and what better place to talk? Nobody will be there, nobody will interrupt us and if something upsetting does happen, a scene won\u2019t be caused.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou take Eliza to the living area to talk. You notice she\u2019s shaking a bit.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re shaking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous. I\u2019ve been nervous about all this for the past few days. I didn\u2019t know what was going to come next. I didn\u2019t even know if you were going to come back after what I said to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you said? If anything, I should be the one apologizing for all the stuff I did. I mean I mean you were right, I dumped all this stuff on to you suddenly, I also just grabbed and kissed you the way I did. That was really out of line, I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the kiss that bothered me, it was just the situation in which it happened really. I always believed our first kiss\u2026if we ever had one, would be under different circumstances.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou take a deep breath before continuing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I feel you should know, I\u2019ve broken up with Cindy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really broke up with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s vowed revenge on me and everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevenge? You don\u2019t think she\u2019ll do anything crazy or violent do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so and least I hope not. Look, I\u2019ll deal with it when it happens. The point is, I want you to know is I\u2019m here for YOU now. If this means your ready, then I\u2019m ready too. If this means you still need some time, I\u2019ll back off and wait. If that means you don\u2019t want me at all, then fine I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\n\n\nEliza takes your hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave. I\u2019ve waited a long time for this moment, but I still have concerns about whether we\u2019ll really be happy together or not. I mean what if you come to the conclusion one day that you\u2019ve made a mistake breaking up with Cindy. I\u2019d hate for you to start resenting me for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, my breaking up with Cindy wasn\u2019t only for you. I mean I hate to admit it, but yeah perhaps there were selfish reasons for breaking up with her as well. Like not wanting to have her plan our entire life out with minimal say on my part. I really should\u2019ve broken up with her earlier (Sigh) I really did handle this poorly. I just hope you can forgive me for putting you through all this.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour talk with Eliza goes on for awhile, eventually you both agree on taking things slow at first, but the pair of you are pretty happy about this new relationship.\n\n\n\nTime passes and your relationship with Eliza is going well. Unfortunately Cindy is true to her word and takes revenge even after she leaves Klyton.\n\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t do it directly, but rather indirectly, namely through her father\u2019s business connections. The price of booze distributed to your family\u2019s inn is increased, the food too. Most of the traveling merchants that used to stay at the inn now have taken their business elsewhere. Your family\u2019s inn takes a huge loss, and it ends up resulting in laying off most of the staff.\n\n\n\nWhile your mother could keep the place running even with all the cut backs, she ultimately decides it isn\u2019t worth it and sells it altogether in a few years. Naturally Cindy\u2019s father makes sure his people are the ones that get a hold of it. The revenge tries to continue on directly through price gouging from a few shops you buy from, but you manage to put an end to that, by reminding the various owners that you\u2019re a doctor and how pissing you off might not be beneficial for their health plan should they ever get sick in the future.\n\n\n\nYou apologize to your mother for the situation with the inn however, but she tells you not to worry about it. She got enough from the sale and is moving to Teckleville like she originally planned. She just hopes that you and Eliza will visit every once in awhile.\n\n\n\nWith Eliza out of a job, she moves in with you. It becomes permanent when you get married. Eventually you also move to Teckleville to start a private practice and soon Eliza gives birth to twins and you start the next phase of your relationship as a family.\n\n\n\nOverall your life with Eliza is a good one and you never regret your decision even if it did result in the loss of your family\u2019s inn. Besides you always had the best thing that was ever connected to that place and really that\u2019s what was important.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Go home", "result": "You never really had a relationship with Eliza on any romantic level; it\u2019s probably just the \u201cidea of Eliza\u201d that\u2019s getting to you. Your life is probably going to change a lot in the near future so your mind is starting to look for loopholes to stay.\n\n\n\nBut you shake off these feelings. Your life is going good right now, why jeopardize it with poor judgment and fear of the unknown? You overcame hardship to get where you are now. To invite more drama when it isn\u2019t necessary would be foolish.\n\n\n\nYou head home and when Cindy is finished with her classes you take her out for romantic dinner to reaffirm your dedication of your future plans together. This seems to please her greatly.\n\n\n\nDuring your last remaining year in Klyton, you don\u2019t visit your family\u2019s inn anymore as a safety precaution. You don\u2019t need doubt plaguing your thoughts again. You do make one more visit to your mom before you do eventually leave though.\n\n\n\nThanks to Cindy\u2019s family connections in the Delantium Kingdom, your job at the Sivak hospital is more or less secured (Obviously hers is as well), though they were in need of more medical professionals anyway. The hospital there is a little newer and understaffed, so for a while you\u2019re working a little more than you usually did, but over time your workload becomes manageable.\n\n\n\nYour life in general plays out rather mundanely, you end up living in a nice area and eventually you have a couple of children. No major problems for you ever truly crop up though.\n\n\n\nAs for the old inn, your mother eventually does sell it a few years after you initially left Klyton and retires to Teckleville. On one of your family visits you ask who bought the place and she says Wendy ended up taking it over, which doesn\u2019t surprise you. Curiosity gets the better of you and you ask your mother for more information on your old co-workers. Your mother mentions that Rita quit about a few months before she sold the place. Apparently she finally snagged a guy rich enough to settle down with. Flameflower took her place as hostess and she, along with her sister Sunshine still work there. As for Eliza your mother says she was still working as the head barmaid there.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll seems like a lifetime ago eh?\u201d your mother says.\n\n\u201cYeah. I suppose so.\u201d You answer a little preoccupied.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong son?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no. Nothing wrong, just momentarily lost in thought.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t really explain anymore than that, but your mother senses that you\u2019re playing \u201cwhat could\u2019ve been\u201d again. She doesn\u2019t address it directly, but does mention of how successful you are and how you\u2019ve got a good life. She also mentions of how it\u2019s everything that your father and her could\u2019ve hoped for you. This truth snaps you out of it, and you never dwell on the past again.\n\n\n\nYou live out the rest of your life in Sivak working as a physician until you decide to retire. You grow old with Cindy, your children eventually have their own families, and one day you fall asleep and don\u2019t wake up.\n\n\n\nYes, it was a good life overall, but your years as an innkeeper were definitely the ones that helped achieve it.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Cindy (Your girlfriend)", "result": "Cindy: Girlfriend\n\n\n\nYou met Cindy about a year and a half ago.

She still has extended family there and remains on good terms with them and hopes to move back some day since she\u2019s never cared much for Klyton, claiming that most of the city doesn\u2019t have the appreciation of the fine arts and is rather \u201clow class\u201d in general.

Of course the few times that she visited the inn, she didn\u2019t make a good impression with most of your acquaintances there.

Nothing pocket breaking, but enough to shut her up and keep Wendy from rebelling in the process.\n\n\n\nThe next few weeks go as well as can be expected, though Rita\u2019s constant complaining is an ongoing problem. Eventually you learn to tune her out, but one day she\u2019s \u201ctuned out\u201d permanently.\n\n\n\nWhile Rita was still more or less doing her job of bringing in more people, her attitude got a lot worse. This sometimes resulted in her driving away people as opposed to enticing them.

You\u2019re not going to finish this one, which is a familiar theme to you since you dropped out of college. You tell your mother what you think and she seems just as eager to sell the place off too since the past few months have been pretty stressful.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn\u2019t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren\u2019t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can\u2019t really stand living in the city without your father anymore.

Mining is still a major job field and the beginnings of industrialization is starting, (a couple of small factories have already been built) but Klyton doesn\u2019t ignore other fields such as medicine or education.\n\n\n\nThe city is still primarily made up of humans, but there has been a small creep in other races making their homes there as well over the years, for better or worse.\n\n\n\n\nThe surrounding area\n\n \nTo the north, the Cloudspeak Mountains form a natural barrier to any possible marauding barbarian tribes. While the mountains themselves are dangerous, it is rare for monsters to venture very far from them. Klyton worked out an agreement with the small dwarf community that lives there long ago for mining rights. A river originating from the Cloudspeak Mountains runs directly east of Klyton. The dwarves keep to themselves for the most part, but sometimes a few come to the city on business.\n\n\n\nTo the south is a mixture of forests and swamps and home to an on going battlefield. The elves and sotakan (A race of lizard like people) have been involved in an ongoing tribal war for at least as long Klyton has ever existed and probably even before that. Neither side ever gains the upper hand for very long and the cycle continues. Klytonians don\u2019t exactly know what it\u2019s all about, they just know they\u2019re glad the savages have always kept their little fight confined to their area. Sometimes elves come to the city to trade, but they\u2019re looked down upon as trouble makers and savages. No Sotakans have ever come to the city at all.\n\n\n\nThe closest human settlement is to the west, a rough port town on the ocean called Hessla. Despite having immediate access to the ocean (or perhaps because of it) it hasn\u2019t grown to a large size like Klyton has. That might be due to several factors. Hesslans have a habit of engaging in piracy other criminal activities involving high levels of violence. There\u2019s floods that occasionally hit the town. But even while teetering on the brink of total anarchy Hessla stays together mainly because a strong leader to prevent that from happening usually always runs it. (Weak Hessla leaders don\u2019t last long) While they have extreme differences in society and some past bad blood, Klyton and Hessla have always maintained a good trading relationship. As far as both are concerned trading with each other is good business regardless of their personal feelings are.\n\n\n\nTo the east past the Cloudspeak River, exist long stretches of plains, scattered woods and the occasional small village. Past that is the Delantium Kingdom. The occasional merchant from there comes to trade and then leaves, though they usually also act as \u201cemissaries\u201d speaking of all the positive things about the Delantium Kingdom and saying how Klyton would be much better off if it joined it. While the Delantium Kingdom has never shown any signs that it would try to take Klyton by force, this sort of talk still makes most Klytons a little wary, as they value their independence and the thought of having to serve a \u201cking\u201d is not appealing at all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back to the story", "result": " \n\nAnother day home from school\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you Ms. Zelamoyer is a witch, there\u2019s no way she could know what we did unless she read our minds!\u201d David says.\n\n\u201cYeah maybe she\u2019s even a demon in human disguise!\u201d Tom adds\n\n\u201cOr maybe you two looked guilty as hell and laughed the loudest when she sat on the thumbtacks you put in her seat.\u201d You say. \u201cI told you guys that was a bad idea.

It wasn\u2019t exactly his favorite thing to do, and given the hard work, long hours and dangers (natural and otherwise) it\u2019s understandable that he wanted something better for his own family.\n\n\n\nSo he saved, scrimped, went without and eventually one day he\u2019d saved enough money to buy himself a small building to open up his own business. He\u2019d always remembered that the first thing miners did after work was go get drunk, so why not open up a tavern? He was already friends with a lot of them so he\u2019d at least have a small base to work with.\n\n\n\nThe first few months were a little shaky, but eventually he started turning a profit. It was more than breaking even, but with another child on the way he had to do better than that. He took into consideration the number of merchants who traveled to the city, and thought expanding the business to accommodate them would bring in more revenue.\n\n\n\nBuilding room additions and making his business into an Inn was a good idea, but it was still primarily a tavern at heart in a working class area. Most traveling merchants didn\u2019t want to endure the rabble rousing of drunken miners during the night, especially the snobbier ones from the Delantium Kingdom. Luckily there were customers your grandfather hadn\u2019t considered\u2026adventurers!\n\n\n\nWandering adventurers became a more common sight in Klyton over the years. They were brought there for several reasons such as exploring the mountains, hiring themselves out as mercenaries for the Elven-Sotakan war or just stopping through on their way to Hessla. These types are used to roughing it and something like a little drunken revelry isn\u2019t going to bother them one bit, in fact they tend to engage in it themselves quite a bit.\n\n\n\nWhen your grandfather died, your father ended up taking over the business. He more or less has continued on a conservative path with it. He doesn\u2019t take as many business chances as your grandfather did, probably because he doesn\u2019t have to as it now provides a steady income.\n\n\n\nHe does do a lot of saving since like your grandfather he believes in providing a better life for his children, namely you. If he and your mother have it their way you\u2019ll be going to Klyton University where you\u2019ll study medicine.\n\n\n\nWhether you achieve their wishes or not remains to be seen\u2026", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}
