Unlike Fay, Cain, Castus, Elios, Durge and Captain Hayes, all of whom absolutely despise their new workloads, with Castus even suggesting a new system of anarchy where the only rule is anyone found filing something is to be shot, you actually like it. Olive, Primus, Elizabeth and you all find a certain level of peace in it. The mental challenges and problem-solving you have to deal with has a certain calming element on your mind.

The stack holds everything from troop psych reports to statistics about your flight wing to estimates about your wealth in various alien currencies.\n\n\n\"What the fuck is that?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"These are the files and reports on our current situation. Thankfully, these have been simplified to the extreme to something that you all can actually comprehend. There's three big, circled figures, labeled Strength, Morale and Funds.

The Morale figure is the general morale of the forces under your command, with 100 being incredibly happy crew to the point of being unbearable, and 0 being a crew that's only refraining from slitting your throat out of fear.

I helped you, paying close attention, seeing potential, and assisted you as best I could. Fortunately, as you fought Kyros, I saw his mental defenses weaken during the fight between you and him. As he lay dying, the mutants at his throat, he was broken. I easily possessed his form, devoured his soul, and killed those stupid mutants with my daemonic powers.\"\n\n\n\"You're a daemon?\" Elios asks.\n\n\n\"Damn right,\" Kyros, or Meliodas, says.\n\n\nYou take some time to explain who Meliodas is to your other lieutenants, but soon they understand. After some extensive questioning and psychic testing to ensure that this is in fact Meliodas, he takes a seat at the table.\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Well, I helped advise Karth. I'm one of his best advisors. Surely I deserve a place here?\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Give him a seat. Us Chaos followers could use an extra vote for our side,\" Durge says. \"Now, can we continue?\"\n\n\n\"Don't hold off on my account,\" Meliodas grins.\n\n\n\"Alright, let's be realistic, shall we?\" Elios says. \"We're Chaos. We worship the Dark Gods, corrupt, parlay with demons, all that shit. We're not changing. We also know that we've lost a shit-ton more men because of little sis' rage against us, so if this comes down to a civil war, we're all dead and you win.\"\n\n\n\"Go on,\" you say.\n\n\n\"So, we have two options.

We should stay.\n\n\n\"I'm not adverse to settling down,\" Fay says. \"But we could take the ship anyway. With control of the ship, we could carve ourselves a little empire.

A good negotiator should be able to convince at least some of them to leave their stations to come aboard the Roar of the Vortex to continue their research aboard our vessel as well as having access to huge archives of intelligence here, being able to research the ship and maintaining that the technology isn't lost.\"\n\n\n\"Who else?\" you ask, \n\n\n\"The Iron Smiths of Daeranthium. Daeranthium is a planet that contains several ancient factories and forges, with massive amounts of resources such as huge, ancient mines.

They've already made a reputation for selling slaves trained with skills such as the ones we desire. For five million Thrones, we could have them soon to fulfill the required role.\"\n\n\n\"You said you have two other options. What are they?\"\n\n\n\"Option one involves the funding an education program to educate the mutant workers. For ten million Thrones, we could educate the mutant population.

We\u2019re forcing our men to face horrors beyond comprehension and risk their lives.

Plus, this would give us the ability to actually begin selling drugs on the open market if we find a better group of cooks and a supplier. Lastly, we could just go all out. Buy a huge quantity of the drugs and start manufacturing them on ship, and just start pumping them out to the crew. Pump the gaseous drugs into the air, put all the soluble drugs into the water supply and crush up everything else to put in the food.

Most pacts were built on weak ground on the unsaid assumption that either party would turn on the other if given the chance, and now that Kyros is no more they're void and useless.

They...\"\n\n\n\"I've heard of them. They were allied to Kyros?\"\n\n\n\"We're unsure of that. It seems they did provide funding for a few of Kyros raids against Imperial worlds. Kyros seemed to have made a noted effort to avoid Tau interests. Kyros had all other information about them purged. I know nothing more about the relationship, but it's most definitely worth investigating.\"\n\n\n\"OK. Who else?\"\n\n\n\"The Kabal of the Bleeding Thorn is a group of Dark Eldar pirates and raiders led by a mysterious figure known as Merideza who had seemingly forged an alliance with Kyros. They're infamous in this sector for their quick, brutal raids on worlds to enslave the populace. They're a powerful organization based out of the sub-dimension known as the Webway in a city known as Commorragh, where all Dark Eldar stay. Although the species aren't known for their loyalty to former allies, they might see our growth as a potential threat.\"\n\n\n\"And the others? The Dogs of War?\"\n\n\n\"The Dogs of War are a renegade chapter of Space Marines led by Chapter Master Christian Firenaza who went renegade after fighting a vast Tyranid fleet and taking severe losses without any support from the rest of the Imperium. They primarily work as a mercenary outfit. Although technically, only the space marines are the Dogs of War, they now consist of dozens of mercenary outfits that serve under them, all known as the Dogs of War. Although one would assume their mercenary status would mean they won't strike at us if they're not being paid to, loyalty seems to be strong among space marines. They might want to avenge Kyros.\"\n\n\n\"We need to attempt to negotiate with these factions to secure their loyalty to us, or at least ensure they're not going to attack,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Understood. The Children of Apep's flagship, the Quill, is collecting tribute from subject worlds and we can easily head there to negotiate.

For our continued payment, he avoided raiding any Tau assets or engaging any of our assets, and he would take our advice in which worlds to hit. If a trade convoy was bringing weapons to the front to fight off our advances, Kyros would target it for us. Additionally, he'd also place us as his prime client for mercenary work and would sell us what he raided.\"\n\n\n\"How much would that deal earn us?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"Twenty million Thrones,\" Varoh says, as you grin.\n\n\n\"Ah, that sounds... acceptable,\" you say.\n\n\n\"What if we refuse?\" Elios asks.\n\n\n\"We have other offers,\" Varoh says. \"If that's too much, we simply want a non-aggression pact, and to have a small group of a half dozen Tau on your vessel to make the voice of the Tau Empire known. You avoid attacking our assets, and we pay you ten million Thrones.\"\n\n\n\"Is that all the offers?\"\n\n\n\"Well... we had offered Kyros a better offer, but he refused.\"\n\n\n\"What was the offer?\"\n\n\n\"For thirty million Thrones, we become allies. We'll offer you our support when needed, and we expect you to offer yours. The terms are similar to the twenty million Thrones offer, except except instead of our advice, you will assist us when we demand. Please know, we will must definitely not be unreasonable. If you find we are taking advantage of you, we are more than happy to rearrange the deal. We'll even give you a small portion of Tau forces to assist you in your mission.\"\n\n\nHmmm... the deal they're offering is an interesting one.
