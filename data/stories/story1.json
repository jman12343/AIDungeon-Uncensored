While challenging, it's not as hard as the movies would have you believe - where they always make the worst possible decisions for the sake of drama. Here, at least, you will be offered logical choices amid the foolhardy and your character cares about survival even more than you do. A serious game with gory detail.\n\n\nStyle\n\nThere is a lot of reading in this story. Pages are filled with lengthy descriptions of who, what, when, where, why, & how. The story is quite long (over 2100 pages) and comes in three major sections (of varying length, depending on what you choose to do in them). Don\u2019t forget your 'Save Game' option...\n\n\nSections\n\nThe first section is the shortest and involves escaping the subway tunnels.\n\nThe second section involves moving around within the city and escaping.\n\nThe third section involves moving through the suburbs to find and save your family.\n\n\nObjective\n\nGet the best ending (or) Get the highest score (or) Kill the most zombies (or) All of the above?\n\n\nScoring\n\nEach choice is assigned a value from 10 - 50 points: Generally, 10 points are given for a bad decisions, 30 points for neutral decisions, and 50 points for the most logical choices. 20 & 40 points are also awarded, when certain choices fall between the other values. Your final Score at the end of the game is the total of all the decisions made, multiplied by a number of special factors (depending on what you accomplish during play).\n\nNote that the highest possible score will not be achieved by making all the right choices - as making the best choices often allow you to bypass certain other 'choice-filled' events, that will net you more points in the long run (if survived) than by simply skipping them altogether in the first place.\n\n\nEndings\n\nAs this is a zombie game, the very best ending can only be achieved by not getting bit at all, but there are still a number of interesting endings available, even if you do get chomped on a time or two. In fact, you are not likely to get the Highest Score with the very best ending - but that's the trade-off.\n\nWith each 'Death Page' and the 'Official Endings', you will have the chance to see how you did before quitting (or going back). A Rundown is included that shows how many zombies and/or people you killed, how many people you saved, how many zombies munched your brains, and of course your Total Score. If at the end of your game you have 10,000 or more points, you will also be able to see a write-up of the Zombie Virus and Zombie Types used during the game.\n\nThe type of ending you achieve will also be reflected in the last digit of your Final Score: Death Pages will produce a score ending in '0'; Official Endings will show a '5'; and the Very Best Ending will show a '7'.\n\nPost a comment to show your high scores to the world!\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nPlease PM me if you find bugs or breaks in logic (such as walking on foot in one scene, then riding a mountain bike in the next, without ever having found the mountain bike first). The most helpful thing you could do is tell me the name of the page with the bug (and) the name of the page you came into that page from, plus a description of what\u2019s not working correctly.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nThis game dedicated to my lovely LadyZerka (and Five Hundred Feet of Heavy Rope in a Barrel)   =)", "action_results": [{"action": "Begin...", "result": "Dead Man Walking.\n\n\nYou are drifting through darkness, floating weightless in an inky black void. Slowly you realize you are not quite awake, but coming out of unconsciousness; you must have passed out for some reason. You try to sit up, but some unseen force holds your body down. With a note of frustration you realize again that you are still not fully awake. Focusing your will you try to start yourself awake, and for a moment it seems to work \u2013 you sit up and look around and can see that you are in a dark tunnel with very little light. You notice a man stooped over some object to your right and try to call out to him, but your voice does not work. Regardless, the man turns to look at you and it is then that you see it is not a man at all, but a smoky silhouette of shadow in vaguely a man-like shape. The thing sets upon you in a flash and you feel a smothering presence overpowering you in the darkness, wrapping you up, holding you down; trying to invade you. In panic you jolt awake \u2013 this time for real.\n\n\nThe first thing you notice is a sharp stabbing pain in your head. Reaching up, you feel your hair matted in blood and grimace as you run your fingers over the jagged edges of what must surely be a serious head wound. Part of your scalp has actually been torn free of your skull and hangs in a greasy mess over your ear. You\u2019re not bleeding from the wound very much \u2013 it seems to have clotted \u2013 but you definitely should get it seen by a medical professional sooner than later\u2026\n\n\nIn addition, your left arm, shoulder, and side are numb. Moving them slightly, you wince at small twinges of pain here and there, but are relieved to see that they are not broken \u2013 though it does seem that you have been thrown down on that side recently and with significant force.\n\n\nSitting yourself up against a wall of cool damp stone you take in your surroundings. The floor is of hard packed dirt with a thick layer of dust on top and (from what you can feel), quite a bit of shattered safety glass lays around you. In the air you smell a mix of smoke and ozone, like when an electrical outlet shorts out. That and the heavy stink of blood (your own maybe, you do seem to have lost quite a bit) and something reminiscent of burning hair\u2026 All in all, it\u2019s somewhat hard to breathe, as if you\u2019re not quite getting enough oxygen with each breath.\n\n\nIt is very dark, but a dim greenish glow stemming from a huge mass of twisted metal before you gives enough illumination to at least make out your hand in front of your face, as well as what\u2019s immediately around you. Looking at the mass in front of you, you can see that it is the wreckage of a subway train \u2013 or perhaps even two trains \u2013 as if one had run up into another on the same track. Now however, the subway cars choke the dark tunnel you are in, cast zigzag across the tracks in a crumpled and jagged pile of wreckage. The greenish glow comes from inside the smashed train cars themselves and you surmise that it would be illumination form the emergency exits.\n\n\nLooking to your right, you see a mangled body without a head. You shudder and wonder what it was you saw standing over that body in your half-conscious dream state.\n\n\nThinking back, you try to remember how you could have arrived in such a predicament, but you can\u2019t get past the pain in your head. Your memory is all cloudy. How much of it have you lost? All of it apparently; you can\u2019t even recall your own name. Looking yourself over for a clue to your own identity, you note that you are wearing reasonably savvy business attire with a gold watch. Unfortunately, the watch is broken, its face smashed and the hands stopped at 7:40 am.\n\n\nChecking your back pocket you find your wallet and upon looking inside, you find your license.\n\n\n\u201cGreg Bradley\u201d, you say to yourself, reading the name off the ID. The address shows a street in the suburbs. There\u2019s also a photo of the wife and kids (you guess). The woman is pretty enough and there are two cute girls \u2013 a ten year old and a younger one, maybe seven.\n\n\nA twinge of frustration creeps into your mind. Why can\u2019t you remember anything? Isn\u2019t seeing things like this supposed to jar a memory or something? You take the photo out of the wallet and tuck it into your breast pocket. Checking the rest of the contents, you find a number of low-end credit cards, $50 cash, and a half dozen of your own business cards; showing that you are an accountant for the Morgan Corporation, located on the 24th floor of the Summit Tower.\n\n\nAlso in your possession is a crushed cell phone (totally dead) and a ring of keys including the key and fob to a Toyota, a house key, a PO Box key, a padlock key, and what you think is an elevator key marked \u2018ST 24\u2019. Incidentally, your key chain also includes a small LED penlight \u2013 which upon testing in the darkness of the tunnel, seems to offer miniscule comfort against the engulfing blackness.\n\n\nIt occurs to you that you should probably find something to bandage your head with. You consider for a moment trying to use your shirt as a makeshift bandage. It seems to work in the movies.\n\n\nIt is then that you hear the rattle of movement from within the pile of train wreckage before you, followed by a long mournful sounding groan. Instinctively, you quickly turn off your penlight and remain still; waiting to see what is making the noise without yet revealing your presence. You don\u2019t hear the sound again and wonder if some injured person is trapped there in the twisted subway cars, waiting for you to make the first move\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait quietly for help to arrive", "result": "You sit in the darkness waiting. Surely someone must know about this train wreck and will be coming to the rescue any minute.\n\n\nThe minutes pass\u2026\n\n\nThe hour passes\u2026\n\n\nAnd then hours pass\u2026\n\n\nYou have been sitting in the darkness for a long time and are starting to feel weak and dizzy in addition to being in pain. Maybe you should have tried to find help for yourself, rather than sit here, probably bleeding out this whole time. On a side note, whoever is there in the train wreckage still seems to be alive \u2013 moaning incoherently from time to time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Bind your head with cloth from your shirt", "result": "As you tear some strips from your shirt, the noise seems to attract the attention of the person trapped in the train wreckage.

You wait nervously in the dark, straining to see, as it emerges from the wreckage. Crawling toward you over the caved-in side of an overturned subway car is a bloody corpse, its lower half fully torn away at the waist and trailing innards behind. The thing can\u2019t possibly be alive, but there it is, frothing bloody foam at the mouth and snapping hungry jaws at you \u2013 like something right out of an old horror movie!", "action_results": [{"action": "Find a large stone to smash its head in with", "result": "Looking along the wall of the dark tunnel with your penlight, you spot a large chunk of cinderblock and quickly heft it up. The horrible thing is still clawing toward you when you bring the heavy piece of concrete down on the back of its head crushing it skull with a sickening splurch of blood, bone, and gray matter.\n\n\nYou are still filled with adrenaline and somewhat dizzy from your exertion, when you look up to the sound of more moaning; and see two more subway passengers, shuffling towards you with outstretched arms from the front part of the train wreck. While they are not moving very quickly, they are on their feet and making a beeline straight for you. They are far enough away from you at the moment, that you are fairly sure you can easily avoid them if you so choose.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait and attack them with your cinder block", "result": "Your cinderblock smashed one lunatic\u2019s head in easy enough; it should work on two more just as well. You have time to maneuver to a higher position on the wreckage of the train cars and there wait for the two subway passengers to pass by. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll get the jump on them.\n\n\nSure enough, the two moaning subway passengers stumble by, not immediately seeing you from your position of ambush. As you leap down at them, you notice that both already look pretty mangled by the train wreck itself \u2013 one even walking on a completely dislocated ankle. Your chunk of cinderblock comes down with you, striking squarely on the top of the first\u2019s head. The monster crumples under the blow immediately as its head explodes in a messy display \u2013 along with your chunk of cinderblock \u2013 which shatters in a dusty rain of crumbling bits.\n\n\nYou look with dismay at your now empty hands, trying to formulate a new plan of action through the mounting sense of panic. It is then that you realize the other one is already on you, having lunged with surprising agility for someone so broken up. Before you can do anything more, you are dragged to the ground as it lunges for your neck. Instinctively, you defend yourself with a raised arm, only to feel the monster bite deeply into it \u2013 tearing a chunk out and taking a moment to chomp on the meaty flesh.\n\n\nYou ignore the pain and grit your teeth, taking advantage of the monster\u2019s momentary distraction to reach blindly for anything on the ground around you to use as a weapon. Amazingly, your left hand brushes over something metallic and heavy enough to give you hope. You grab hold and slam the object into the lunatic\u2019s temple, knocking it over and allowing you to scramble up. You no longer have whatever it was in your hand, but the thing isn\u2019t getting up either. Not waiting to give it a moment\u2019s quarter, you stomp on the back of its neck repeatedly, crunching up its vertebrae, until you are satisfied that it isn\u2019t going to get up anytime soon. That is when you notice the railroad tie spike buried in the side of its head.\n\n\nTaking a moment to calm yourself and regain your wind you think about what to do next.", "action_results": [{"action": "Climb through the wreckage to the front of the subway train", "result": "You move quickly, ignoring the mess behind you and the throbbing pain of your injuries, making your way over and through the wreckage of the train cars that scatter the tunnel in the direction the train was headed before the wreck.\n\n\nAlong the way you see dead bodies everywhere, smashed into the twisted metal of the wrecked train cars \u2013 each more gruesome than the last. Disturbingly, you also notice an unusually large amount of entrails scattered about. You somehow doubt that that many people could all have been disemboweled simultaneously by a simple train wreck \u2013 even one as serious as this one appears to be. You\u2019re not sure (and you certainly don\u2019t want to get close enough to find out firsthand), but some of the bodies even look as if they have recently been savaged, as if by some wild animals\u2019 rending jaws. As you get further along, you also notice a large number of bloody footprints headed in the same direction you are going. They seem to be joined by more and more footprints as you pass through one mangled subway car after another.\n\n\nAt length you get to the front of the train you must have been riding on. In walking, you surmise that you had been on the train and thrown out a window when it crashed. You must have struck your head when you landed, which knocked you out for who knows how long. On that thought, you risk approaching a random victim\u2019s arm sticking out of the wreckage to take their watch. Unlike yours, this one still works and indicates the time to be 6:04 pm. If that is correct, and your watch indicates the time of the crash, that means you were out of it for roughly ten hours. Wow, you\u2019d better not go back to sleep until you can get yourself to a hospital or you might not wake up again. You also find a working cell phone in the aisle as you go and see that it still works, but there\u2019s no signal down here in the subway tunnel.\n\n\nLooking at the first car of your train, you see that it is completely flattened under the rear cars of another train. It looks as if the first train was stopped on the tracks and your train somehow ran into the back of it at a rather high rate of speed.\n\n\nContinuing on, you cautiously pass through the scattered cars of this train with much the same scene of carnage cast before your eyes, until you finally arrive at the head of the first train. Unlike your train the first car of this train is relatively intact. You know that at the very front of the train is a control room, which hopefully will have at least a first aid kit and if you\u2019re lucky, a working radio. As you approach, you see that all the bloody footprints leave the train at this point and continue down the tunnel in the direction the train was headed. They are quickly lost however in the hard-packed dirt and darkness of the tunnel itself \u2013 though following them won\u2019t be a problem \u2013 you only got one direction to go \u2013 unless you want to turn around and go back the way you just came.", "action_results": [{"action": "Search the train\u2019s control room before deciding what to do", "result": "The door to the train\u2019s control room is locked, but you are able to go outside and pull the smashed remains of the train car\u2019s windshield out, allowing you to climb inside. When the train was hit from behind, it caused the cars of both trains to accordion together, sending them sliding almost sideways down the tunnel into each other until this particular car got wedged in a narrow spot and caused the massive and jagged pileup behind it. As you enter the control room, you see that the driver of the train has been crushed to death by the front of the train as it smashed into the side of the tunnel and got wedged in. You try not to look too closely at his flattened and gore drained shell; or the pool of mess under what\u2019s left of his seat.\n\n\nChecking the area, you see a map of the train lines on one wall and note that the train was headed into the city before it crashed. That makes sense to you, as you would have been traveling from your house in the suburbs to your office in the city during the morning rush. Looking around some more, you find a well-stocked first aid kit, a proper flashlight, a crowbar, some signal flares, a large fire extinguisher, and working CB radio. You also find the train operator\u2019s book bag with his lunch in it and help yourself to the contents, seeing as he won\u2019t miss it anytime soon. You\u2019re actually surprised that it tastes so good, given that you\u2019re eating it in a small room with a horribly mangled corpse just a few feet away.\n\n\nAfter eating, you wrap your wounds in proper bandages and down a couple of pain pills and a no doze. You\u2019re pretty sure you don\u2019t want to fall asleep in here regardless of the head injury. You definitely don\u2019t feel safe down here in this tunnel of death. Packing the first aid kit, flashlight, and signal flares in the book bag, you heft the crowbar in your hand and check out the CB Radio \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s not the portable kind, but definitely worth trying to call for help on.\n\n\nYou consider trying to take the large fire extinguisher, but are not sure about the weight versus utility. It can wait till you\u2019re ready to leave, so you decide to address it again after trying the radio.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try the CB Radio", "result": "After a while trying the current channel with no response, you try calling out on the other channels. Just when you are ready to give up, you dial channel 7 and hear a voice answer you on the other end.\n\n\n\u201cHelp, I\u2019ve been in a subway train wreck!\u201d you say over the com.\n\n\n\u201cThis is Officer Main of the 3rd Precinct, who is this, over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh, my name is Greg Bradley\u201d, you identify yourself, \u201cI\u2019m on a wrecked subway car down in the tunnels, I don\u2019t know where exactly. Everyone onboard is either dead or gone.\u201d\n\n\nYou hear an awkward pause on the other end of the com, and then Officer Main\u2019s voice comes back on, slow and grim.\n\n\n\u201cListen Greg, there is no easy way to tell you this, but the whole world has gone to shit, just like that train down there. Some sort of terrorist bio-weapon released on the city this morning. A poison gas, or virus, or the like. It causes those exposed to suffer death-like symptoms, including a semi rigor mortis like state, and then they go crazy with cannibalistic rage. Just like the zombies in them movies. And like the movies, you got to hit them in the head and destroy their brain in order to put them down for good. Also, if you get bit by one you got roughly ten minutes before you\u2019re one of them yourself \u2013 though I did heard this one guy actually lasted three hours before he changed. You haven\u2019t been bitten now have you\u201d he asks, pausing for a reply.\n\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, you say quickly, looking at your arm but not wanting to lose contact with what could possibly be the last living soul in the city.\n\n\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d Officer Main continues, \u201cHere\u2019s what you need to do. Follow the tracks to the first station and get to the streets above. The first thing you need to do is avoid contact with any zombies. Next, you need to get your bearings and know where you are in the city \u2013 get a street map if you can. Then find a pry bar or tire iron and drop yourself into the nearest \u2018center of the street\u2019 manhole cover. It has to be one in the center of a main street, not a side street or manhole cover near the curb. And unless you\u2019re Lou Ferrigno, you\u2019ll need the tire iron to lever up the hundred and seventy five pound manhole cover. Obviously a light is going to be handy down there too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou still with me?\u201d he asks.\n\n\n\u201cUh, yeah, I understand,\u201d you reply \u2013 more than a little apprehensive about some plan to go down into more dark tunnels with ravening cannibalistic zombies lurking about.\n\n\n\u201cGood\u201d he continues. \u201cOnce inside, set the manhole cover back behind you \u2013 this should keep the zombies from following you in, unless you really piss them off for some reason. There shouldn\u2019t be any zombies in the sewer tunnels \u2013 or if there are, there\u2019ll be a hell of a lot less in there than on the streets. Once in the main sewer line, follow it just like you would the streets above to our Precinct House here on 3rd and Spring Street. You\u2019ll see street names marked at each intersection of the tunnels and they run directly under the center of most streets. When you get to 3rd and Spring Street, you\u2019ll need to be careful. The zombies are thick in this area, but we\u2019re nice and safe here in our Precinct House. Like a fortress here, and well-armed, so you don\u2019t got to worry once you\u2019re inside \u2013 you just have to make a dash from the street to the door is all \u2013 you are good at running right? Over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m injured; got a head wound\u201d, you reply, \u201cbut I suppose I can run a short distance all right. What about the hospitals though? I think I really need medical attention rather quickly. Uh, over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t go to any hospital! They are all overrun with the dead and undead. We have medical supplies here and a triage unit with doctors and a surgeon. You get yourself here and we can help you. You hear?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks for the information. I\u2019ll try to get to you,\u201d you say, not really certain about it just yet.\n\n\n\u201cGood Luck.

You don\u2019t remember anything of them yet, but perhaps seeing one of them in person will trigger the return of your memories. You know they must love you and wonder if they are safe.\n\n\nHas the attack spread into the suburbs; or is it contained in the city? What if it spreads further? Is this the only city to be attacked; or are there more cities across the country facing the zombie threat?\n\n\nYou\u2019re not entirely sure how far your home is from the city, but you think you had just over a 40 minute commute \u2013 yeah, that sounds right. You try to work out in your head how far that would be in miles if you estimate the average speed of the train, when it occurs to you just to look at the line map on the wall of the control room. There you see that your suburb is twenty-six miles away from Summit Station (you presume under Summit Tower where you work), taking the green line from Summit Station to Fairmont Station and from there, the yellow line to Suburbia Station. Now all you need to know is where on the green line you are currently, which you won\u2019t find out until you walk in one direction or the other to a station.\n\n\nOf course, what is the point if you\u2019re just going to turn into one of those things in\u2026\n\n\nYou look at your watch, it says 9:05pm\u2026\n\n\nYou got about two hours left.

Time flies when you\u2019re having fun, you think sarcastically.\n\n\nAfter another five or so minutes of plodding along, you begin to think you can see a dull light in the tunnel way up ahead.

Your muscles all feel tight and you\u2019re incredibly weak and tired \u2013 like your wounds and exhaustion are finally hitting you all at once.\n\n\nYou stop and steady yourself on the wall of the tunnel a moment as your head swims and you nearly pass out. Nice. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel and now you\u2019re going to pass out and get eaten by wandering zombies before you even can make it. Typical.\n\n\nYou begin to wonder if this is the zombie contagion at work \u2013 you have been bit after all. Are you really going to die and rise up as a brain eating monster?\n\n\nYuck. You never did like the thought of eating brains, or livers, or that other disgusting stuff people eat sometimes. Hell, you can\u2019t even swallow sushi without gaging.\n\n\nYeah, you\u2019ll make a real classy zombie, you think sarcastically to yourself, gagging on other peoples\u2019 brains.\n\n\nAfter another flash of near unconsciousness, you desperately look around the tunnel for some place of refuge to sit and weather out the storm \u2013 or at least a place to die in peace. You\u2019d much rather be munched on by zombies when dead than to have them find and eat you alive.\n\n\nYou find nothing significant, just an old sheet of heavy plywood leaned up against the side of the tunnel. With nothing more than that, and unconsciousness threatening to overtake you at any moment, you make due as best you can with what you have. You pull the bottom of the plywood sheet out a few feet from the wall of the tunnel, making a place behind that you can crawl into.\n\n\nYou go inside and turn out your light, noting the ever faint light still visible down at the end of the tunnel. There you lie on the ground, hidden behind your makeshift shelter, feeling feverish while the pain of your head wound and the tightness of your muscles is lost in the burning sensation that has slowly spread out from where you were bit by zombies to fill your whole body.\n\n\nYou lull in semi-consciousness; now almost sorry that you took that no doze. At least if you had fallen asleep and not woke up, you wouldn\u2019t have to be going through this right now. Your mind reels, jumping chaotically between the horrifying scenes of slaughter witnessed this day and half memories of your family, that feign to come back but then evaporate just before your mind can latch onto them.\n\n\nYou then realize that the burning tightness in all your muscles has progressed to complete paralysis \u2013 you can\u2019t even move your fingers or close your eyes. You lay there completely rigid, unable to move, until even your vision blurs.\n\n\nYou\u2019re not sure how long you lay there, drifting in and out of awareness, until you suddenly notice you can see clearly again and blink. You also hear what you think is the beeping of a morning alarm coming from somewhere. Then, all at once, every muscle of your body suddenly releases, and you find yourself drenched in sweat. Your fever is gone and you no longer feel a burning throughout your body or even where you were bit by zombies. Now you\u2019re just in good old fashion pain.\n\n\nYou look at your watch and see that it\u2019s 6:00am \u2013 the time you normally get up in the morning to get ready for work. You then realize the alarm on your watch is beeping and you quickly turn it off and grab your crowbar, hoping the sound hasn\u2019t attracted any zombies to your position. You crawl out from behind your shelter to listen and then look yourself over. You appear normal \u2013 not the walking dead like you expected. You quickly do some math in your head. No problem.

Your heart sinks as you draw near and hear the echoing din of a large mass of zombies from within. You hover in the darkness of the tunnel, carefully venturing forward just enough to get a look inside.\n\n\nA hundred and some of the former subway passengers \u2013 all trapped in the rush hour mob and unable to escape the initial outbreak \u2013 pack the area, half on the landing platform itself and half down on the tracks.\n\n\nThose on the tracks look a lot worse for wear; most torn up from the subway crash you just came from \u2013 or even other crashes farther up ahead. They moan and snarl at each other, jostling and crowding toward the edge of the loading platform, trying most ineffectually at climbing up the four foot ledge. Occasionally one does manage to get up, but is quickly pulled back down by the rest trying to climb up over its back.\n\n\nYou are reminded of a bucket of crabs. You remember once seeing one in Maine \u2013 there\u2019s another memory \u2013 you don\u2019t need to put a lid on a full bucket of crabs; they all try to climb up over each other. The moment one gets to the top, it is collectively grabbed by the rest and dragged back down to the bottom of the bucket.\n\n\nYou snap out of your reflection and focus on the area itself. The zombies don\u2019t see you yet and you doubt they\u2019d hear you over the clamor, unless you did something to intentionally attract their attention.\n\n\nThe station is large and tiled, with a high vaulted ceiling and a large placard reading: \u201cFox Park Station\u201d. You see that the light is coming from a large number of battery powered emergency lights along the top of the walls. You also see, just beyond the crowded landing platform, two exits. The first is a turnstile gate at your end of the platform with an escalator and set of stairs going up on the other side. The second is an open set of stairs and an escalator at the far end of the platform beyond all the zombies.\n\n\nOn the track level itself are two sets of rails, both empty of any trains. Apparently, the platform side is for stopping, while the outer track is for passing through. As the trains all go the same way through the tunnels, you know there must also be another tunnel and station nearby for the trains going in the opposite direction. Typically, it would be close enough that you could buy a ticket in the terminal above the tunnels and then simply come down the right set of escalators to your platform.\n\n\nYou spot a dingy red metal door in the outer wall of the tunnel opposite the landing platform. While the light\u2019s not great, there is enough that you can make out the words on its surface: \"Railway Workers Only!\"\n\n\nAs you stand in the shadows of the tunnel looking over the scene, you also spot a four foot long piece of heavy planking, lying on the ground where you would exit the tunnel. You\u2019ll have to be sure not to trip over it when you are ready to go.\n\n\nMan there are a lot of zombies in here!\n\n\nGiven that, you think over your options \u2013 The open stairs and escalator at the far end of the landing platform is a no go \u2013 way too many zombies to get past even to think about it. Then there is the turnstile exit gate with the escalator and stairs on the other side. The problem with that is: to get to the stairs you\u2019ll have to hop onto the landing platform with hundreds of zombies and make it to the turnstile exit gate and jam it before they swarm you. There is also the matter of the turnstiles being one-way. If there are zombies on the other side of it, you won\u2019t be able to come back the way you came.\n\n\nThe red door option on the other side of the tunnel would be much easier to get to, but if you\u2019re detected, the zombies on the tracks will move after you and block your way back to the tunnels. You don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s locked or even goes anywhere \u2013 for all you know it may just be an access door to firefighting equipment \u2013 though you would think it would say so if that was the case\u2026\n\n\nYou could also try to sneak past the horde altogether, while they are distracted, in order to continue further down the tunnels towards the center of the city. If the rest of the stations are like this one though, then you\u2019ll have to deal with getting out of the tunnels sooner or later\u2026\n\n\nYou could also just turn around and head back the way you came; trying instead to leave the city altogether rather than move any deeper into it.\n\n\nAfter weighing your odds, you:", "action_results": [{"action": "Make a run for the turnstile gate through the zombie hoard", "result": "Taking a deep breath, you rush out from the shadows of the tunnel and over to the nearest edge of the landing platform.

The two zombies you had knocked down simply get back up and those of the hoard not occupied with your bag have pushed forward around the melee.

The zombies stop short for just a moment, apparently blinded, or at least confused by the sudden stimuli. Not wasting the advantage, you scramble the last few feet toward the turnstile gate \u2013 when something grabs your leg and threatens to drag you back into the hoard.\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of the prone zombies you knocked down in your charge \u2013 you had almost forgot about them in the mounting panic of your situation. Looking, you can see all four of them beginning to get back up, but the closest of them has grabbed a hold of your pant leg and is now sinking its teeth deep into your calf. You cry out in pain as the ugly thing rips free a wide strip of your flesh and grins \u2013 mouth dripping your own blood. Still having a hold of the fire extinguisher, you curse loudly and slam the butt of it down on the zombie\u2019s head with all your might. A gruesome spray of wet gore splats across your legs as the thing\u2019s head pops like a melon between the butt of the extinguisher and hard tile floor. You force yourself to ignore your own injury and the revulsion of such a gory sight \u2013 skittering through the turnstile before the rest of the zombies can get to you.\n\n\nImmediately, the zombie hoard tries to reach through the bars of the gate to get at you. Looking at the stairs and escalator, you see that there are no zombies on this side of the gate \u2013 Phew! Maybe you\u2019ll get out of this yet. The problem is that you\u2019re now bleeding from the burning bite on back of your leg and are currently stuck holding the gate yourself to keep the zombies from following you through it.

That just leaves two options \u2013 sacrifice your crowbar to lockup the turnstile \u2013 or simply make a run for the stairs (hoping your injured leg will carry you through), knowing that the zombies will follow, but only just a few at a time through the confined space of the turnstile gate\u2026\n\n\nAlso, you have lost your book bag and the med kit, signal flares, and proper flashlight within (though you still have the penlight on your keychain).", "action_results": [{"action": "Let go and make a break for the stairs (keeping your crowbar)", "result": "You deice that you need your crowbar too much to leave it behind and make a break for the stairs, letting go of the turnstile gate and running as fast as you can go with a limp.\n\n\nTwo zombies immediately force themselves through the turnstile gate, but the press of those behind them completely jams up the works.

The throng of angry zombies meanwhile, still tries to push through the gate after you, but is unable to pass. They glare at you with frustrated moans and snarls, flattening the trapped zombie in the process.\n\n\nWhen the first zombie gets head level with your waist you swing for the fences and clock it in the side of the head so hard, that its ear explodes under the blow, and it is sent flying over sideways off the steps. It crashes heavily to the hard tile floor below and remains still for a moment, but then slowly begins to right itself.\n\n\nThe second zombie keeps coming and reaches to grab at your legs, but you anticipate such a move and backpedal up the stairs a bit more, giving you room to wind up a brutal overhead swing. Your crowbar lands on top of the nasty creature\u2019s head so hard that its skull caves in with a cracking-splorch \u2013 and a bloody spray of teeth splatter your feet as they shoot out of what was once the awful thing\u2019s mouth.\n\n\nBy this time, the first zombie has staggered back up and is heading for the stairs again. You see a long red welt raised up on the side of its head, where its ear used to be. You again raise you crowbar over your head and wait. When it gets up to you on the stairs, you kick its chest hard, sending it once more tumbling back down to the tile floor below. This time however, you hurry after it and plunge the chisel-end of your crowbar into the back of its head before it can get up again. The thing convulses violently a moment and then goes still, before you pull your crowbar out of its skull with a wet sucking sound.\n\n\nYou glance over at the turnstile gate, relieved to see that the agitated zombies are still jamming it up with their hapless compatriot.\n\n\nLimping up the stairs to the subway\u2019s main corridor, you see the wide concrete and tile entryway into the subway itself; and you can actually see the exit to your left, beyond a bank of narrow token-operated turnstiles. Unfortunately, a huge mass of zombies crowd the area \u2013 both in front of the turnstiles and on the other side, where the tunnel itself simply opens without walls to the outside. You stifle a gag, as the smell of blood and death is overpowering here. Looking at the floor of the main corridor, you shudder to see hundreds of ripped open and dismembered bodies lying in sticky footprint-tracked pools of maggot and fly infested blood. You force yourself to ignore the nauseating massacre and take in the more pertinent details of the scene.\n\n\nDirectly across from the stairway you just came up is another stairway headed back down. The sign over the stairs reads: \u201cNorth Platform.\u201d You know that this is the stairway that leads back down to the other end of the platform you just escaped. It\u2019s a good thing zombies are stupid \u2013 or they could just turn from the turnstile gate you blocked and come right up those stairs unimpeded.\n\n\nTo your right, the subway\u2019s main corridor goes another hundred or so feet and ends at another set of opposing stairs, where a much smaller group of ten or twelve zombies mill about. The signs above these stairways read: \u201cSouth Platform\u201d and \u201cExit Only\u201d respectively. You know they would take you down to the subway\u2019s southbound platform \u2013 no doubt just as zombie infested as the north platform was.\n\n\nBetween you and that far end of the corridor \u2013 about fifty feet away \u2013 are three sets of doors. The first door is on the opposite side of the tunnel from you and is a security door broken off the top hinges. It hangs open at an odd angle and looks bent out slightly, as if it had been forced open recently. It has a pushpin key lock in it, but doesn\u2019t look like it can be closed anymore, and has the words: \u201cTransit Authority: Subway Personnel Only\u201d is written on its face.\n\n\nThe second door is on your side of the tunnel, just a little further down from the first. It is also a security door, closed and locked with a pushpin key lock, and reads: \u201cSecurity Office\u201d on the front. Next to the door itself is a huge smashed out window \u2013 creating a six foot wide, four foot high, opening into the security area beyond. The bloody body of a security guard hangs out of the window frame, the back half of his head apparently blown out from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Below the window frame is a scattering of broken glass and a bloody pile of corpses \u2013 some you note with huge holes in their heads as well. You also think you can see the pistol the guard must have used to blow his brains out, lying in the gore.\n\n\nThe final set of doors, about thirty feet further down the tunnel from the security office, are the doors to the men and women\u2019s restrooms.\n\n\nGiven the circumstances, you have to rule out the exit. There is no way you\u2019re going to be able to get through all those zombies. They would tear you apart, like all the other unfortunates that now litter the floor.\n\n\nThere is also no point in going back down to either subway platform. That would be suicide.\n\n\nYou really don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom all that bad; so there\u2019s no point getting trapped in a restroom. Besides, you can think of a lot more pleasant places to be killed by zombies anyway.\n\n\nThat leaves the broken transit authority door or the security office door (with the pistol).\n\n\nGiven the distance between both groups of zombies and the doors, you estimate that you can get to either door before the zombies can get to you \u2013 even if they spot you.

As you look, you see a zombie stumble out of one of the office doors to wander aimlessly down the hall away from you.\n\n\nAt the far end of the corridor, beyond the lone zombie with its back to you, you can also see another security door, this one intact, but also shut and secured with a pushpin key lock.\n\n\nGreat; you\u2019re about to be sandwiched between the zombie ahead and the coming horde from behind \u2013 you\u2019d better decide what to do fast\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Take out the lone zombie with your crowbar, allowing a few moments access to the security door before the other two zombies show up behind you", "result": "You sprint right up the corridor, toward the lone zombie near the closed security door.

In the ceiling above, you note a two and a half by four foot metal access panel of some sort bolted shut.

You can guess that the north and south subway stations platforms are on the other side of those doors \u2013 and the south station probably just as zombie infested as the north station is.\n\n\nAlso in the area is a large collection of unknown machinery and a giant spool of old-fashion canvas fire hose. You don\u2019t see anywhere to hook the hose up to (and it\u2019s far too brittle to use anymore), but do notice a crowbar and fire axe on a wall not too far from you next to a large fire extinguisher.\n\n\nTaking some time to search the area, you find some items of potential use. The first thing is a number of lengths of iron piping. You take two pieces and are able to thread them through the handles on both of the red doors to crudely bar them from the inside. Now you have a secure area free of zombies to catch your breath in.\n\n\nThe next thing you find is a working deep sink along one wall. You know that the water in the lines can become contaminated in a citywide disaster, but you figure the water this far down is probably still safe. You take the risk and gulp down the rusty tasting water until you\u2019re filled. Then after splashing some on your face to invigorate yourself a bit, you find a hundred foot coil of three-quarter inch hemp rope on a pile of old tarps.\n\n\nThe rope is a little heavy, but you find that you can easily carry the coil across your shoulder and decide that it will be worth having. Most of the tarps are too big and brittle from age to be of use, but you do find a smaller, eight by ten foot, plastic tarp under the pile in good condition and are able to fold it up small enough to take with you. You also find a relatively clean section of canvas tarp and tear some strips out of it to use as bandages for your wounds. You consider cleaning your head wound in the sink, but figure the dried mat of blood is probably the only thing keeping you from bleeding to death and decide to leave it alone, except to wrap it a little more with a strip of canvas.\n\n\nFinally, you discover an old vintage Pepsi machine in the corner. It looks like something out of the seventies and has no soda in it, but you do find three empty Pepsi bottles on the floor nearby \u2013 the old kind with extra thick glass. Taking the bottles, you fill them with water and cork them with balled up strips of tarping.\n\n\nLooking at the heavy fire extinguisher you\u2019ve been lugging around (and all the rest of the gear you want to carry), you decide that it really isn\u2019t worth lugging and leave it. You also take a moment to weight the option of carrying a crowbar versus the fire axe. Both are useful, but heavy, and you don\u2019t want to get loaded down with too much \u2013 as you\u2019re already fatigued and want to be able to move fast when you have to. The crowbar offers a little more utility than the fire axe, but has less reach. You\u2019re pretty sure however, that as a weapon the fire axe will do more damage, but you can also envision it getting stuck in some zombie\u2019s skull if you\u2019re not careful.\n\n\nGathering your gear, you think about your options. You can try to escape out of a red door and continue up or down the subway tunnels, knowing they are all full of zombies \u2013 or you can go back up to the top of the stairwell and see if you can pry open that metal access panel in the ceiling; who knows what\u2019ll be behind it\u2026\n\n\nBut first, you need to choose the crowbar or fire axe:", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the crowbar", "result": "You choose the crowbar.\n\n\nNow the hard part \u2013 try to escape out of a red door and continue up or down the subway tunnels, knowing they are all full of zombies \u2013 or go back up to the top of the stairwell and see if you can pry open that metal access panel in the ceiling.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go upstairs to pry open the access panel", "result": "You pop the bolts and pry open the metal access panel, revealing a two by four foot wide metal duct, heading straight up a good forty or so feet.

You uncoil your rope and tie one end to your waist and the other end to a bundle of your gear. You intend to scale up the main duct, and then pull your gear up after you get to the top.\n\n\nYou then step up onto the rail of the stairs and with no small effort, pull yourself up into the duct. Once you\u2019re actually in, it\u2019s much easier \u2013 as you can wedge your back and legs against opposite sides of the shaft and inch your way up.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, you arrive at the top and can see through the blades of a huge industrial fan in front of the large grate. Because there is no power to the fan, it won\u2019t be any trouble to squeeze through. Looking out of the grate, you see that you are on the ground floor of a parking garage near the collection booths at the exit.\n\n\nYou can see two entry lanes and two exit lanes near the collection booths \u2013 both of which are choked with abandoned vehicles that were trying to exit the garage and got backed up by blocked traffic. You shudder as you see blood splattered and tracked everywhere, but interestingly enough, no bodies; as if people had actually been ripped from their cars and dragged off by some inhuman creatures. You can actually see into the back seat of a car nearby \u2013 its doors still open \u2013 and you are set aghast at the empty blood splattered infant seat inside.\n\n\nAs you soak in the lonely bloodbath of the parking garage, you suddenly hear a long shrill shriek from somewhere out in the city nearby. It sounds like a woman, but not human \u2013 more savage and animalistic \u2013 more hunting call than a cry of distress.\n\n\nThe scary thing is that it sounds nothing like a zombie.

You live in the suburbs with your wife, girls, and one cat; and work in the city as an accountant for the Morgan Corporation \u2013 an advertising firm. Monday through Friday you catch a commuter train in the suburbs to Fairmont Station in the city, where you hop on the Green Subway Line to the Summit Tower Station. Your commute takes about forty-five minutes. On weekends you like to just be with your family, but do go mountain-biking a couple of times a year with friends you\u2019ve had since college. You and your wife used to go camping quite frequently, but that sort of dropped off after your first daughter was born. Your life is nothing special, but for a moment you treasure each memory \u2013 having until just recently had none to treasure at all.\n\n\nYou were an only child of parents who divorced when you were young. You went with your mother at that time; who is still alive, but now lives in a New England nursing home with Alzheimer\u2019s. Your father was an alcoholic and died of liver failure. Your wife\u2019s parents are both still alive, still married, and live in sunny Arizona. They fly you and the family out to their ranch every Christmas, along with the rest of their own family. Your wife has many brothers and sisters, but you really don\u2019t interact with them very much (except over the holiday) and don\u2019t even know all of their names. And that has nothing to do with you losing your memory; you just never cared enough to make the effort.\n\n\nYes, it has all come back except for a missing week. The last thing you remember before waking up in the subway tunnel was leaving your office on Thursday to get on the elevator on the 24th floor of the Summit Tower. You take the keys out of your pocket and look at your elevator key \u2013 the one marked \u2018ST 24\u2019. It\u2019s for the express elevator that goes straight to the Morgan Corporation offices.\n\n\nYou then think about your situation. Pretty damn grave. You were a boy-scout and have some basic survival skills, including being able to handle firearms \u2013 or at least you know how to shoot skeet with a shotgun. How much different can blasting zombies in the head be? Now if you only had a shotgun\u2026\n\n\nYou also worry greatly for your family. Your wife would be home \u2013 hopefully barricaded in, while your girls would have been on the bus to school at the time of the outbreak. Damn! You hope they at least made it to the school, knowing that in such an emergency the school would initiate a lockdown. Maybe they are safe inside waiting for help. You hope so.\n\n\nAfter a few more days, you\u2019re still tied up in the branches of the tree and barely conscious from blood loss, dehydration, and numbness in you limbs. The zombie horde still has nothing better to do than to wait below, as animated about you now as ever. \u2013 Freaking one-track minds! You think to yourself morbidly. Hey, at least you\u2019re not swearing anymore.\n\n\nYou can\u2019t help but chuckle weakly.\n\n\nJust before blacking out for good, you think you can see that strange black shadowy shape from your unconscious dreams in the subway, lurking among the zombies below.

No one deserves that.\n\n\nYou\u2019re not sure you want to be a willing party to this anymore.\n\n\n\u201cThe swab,\u201d Doctor Helisenko says again, snapping you from your thoughts.", "action_results": [{"action": "Willingly give him the culture swab he is after", "result": "You take the culture swab and stick it in your mouth then hand it back to the doctor.\n\n\n\u201cNow that wasn\u2019t so hard,\u201d the doctor says, taking the sample back to his lab table to start working on it.\n\n\nThe officer on watch meanwhile, puts his taser away and goes to sit back down at his desk.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, another officer enters the lab with some food and drink for the other prisoner. He slides it into his cell and then leaves the lab.\n\n\nThe man rolls groggily out of bed and proceeds to silently wolf down the food. When he\u2019s done, he throws the tray out of his cell. \u201cIt was fucking delicious!\u201d he yells sarcastically.\n\n\n\u201cWatch it Connolly!\u201d the officer on watch says in annoyance, \u201cor it\u2019s the taser and more sedatives for you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worse than the fucking Nazis!\u201d Connolly snaps back.\n\n\n\u201cSay something else,\u201d the officer replies, but the prisoner returns to his rack and just remains silent. Apparently he knows just how far he can push things.\n\n\nThe doctor is unfazed by the commotion and once again absorbed in his work.\n\n\nAfter a few hours, he readies another syringe, this time with a clear liquid in it. Something made from your saliva you would guess.\n\n\nConnolly sees him coming over to his cell with it and jumps out of his rack \u2013 \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d he yells defiantly, backing away from the front of the cage.\n\n\nA moment later and he has been tased through the bars by the officer on watch, who then opens his cell and holds him helplessly on the floor, as Doctor Helisenko injects him in the leg with the syringe.\n\n\nThe officer and doctor then exit the cell and lock it back up.\n\n\nMan, they are some cold hearted bastards! you think to yourself. How can they just do that to the man \u2013 a criminal or not!\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, Connolly begins to stir; only he\u2019s acting sort of funny. He abruptly throws up and starts twitching violently and then suddenly is still again. The doctor watches all this of course, recording it down on his clipboard.\n\n\nA couple more minutes and Connolly begins to stagger up again \u2013 only he\u2019s not Connolly anymore. He wobbles around a moment, before looking at you with hollow-looking dead eyes. You know that he has turned! He wails loudly and lunges at you, trying to reach you through the bars between your two cells.\n\n\n\u201cShit! What the heck did you give him?\u201d the officer on watch asks in shock.\n\n\n\u201cIt was our fine subject\u2019s saliva,\u201d the doctor replies indifferently.\n\n\n\u201cApparently, while he is immune to the zombie virus, he is still a carrier. His blood is harmless to us, but his bite is deadly. Also, I wouldn\u2019t recommend kissing, or sharing a drink with him.\u201d\n\n\nYour head suddenly swims as you try to absorb what the doctor has just said.\n\n\nYou heart suddenly sinks. God \u2013 this means you can never kiss your wife or kids again.\n\n\nAt least you know. It would be a heartrending tragedy to have gone home to rescue your family, just to end up turning them all into zombies.\n\n\nIt's almost too much to stomach.\n\n\nYou begin to weep for the \u2018loss\u2019 of your family\u2026\n\n\nThe zombie prisoner meanwhile, continues to snarl and fret as it tries to get at anyone it sees.\n\n\nThe officer on watch goes over and tases it through the bars. The zombie abruptly goes more rigged than normal, as the over-voltage courses through its body, but it doesn\u2019t fully affect it like you know it would affect you. The zombie doesn\u2019t even fall over; it more or less just stands there as it is getting zapped, like it\u2019s more confused by the stimuli than anything else.\n\n\nWhen the officer finally stops tasing it, it immediately animates angrily towards him and reaches out through the bars moaning angrily\n\n\nMental note, don\u2019t bother taking a taser to a zombie fight.\n\n\n\u201cIs it going to be like this the whole time?\u201d the officer on watch asks the doctor.\n\n\n\u201cPatience officer,\u201d the doctor replies, \u201cwe only need to keep him around until the morrow. By then I\u2019ll have an antidote to test. If it doesn\u2019t work, then we can get rid of him. I\u2019m sure that we can always get more \u2018volunteers\u2019 to test things out on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, by that you\u2019d better mean the zombies already out there,\u201d the officer replies to the doctor, \u201cIf I ever see you waste another human life like that again\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Doctor Helisenko cuts him off abruptly. \u201cYou know that a live test was necessary to find the cure.

Let\u2019s see how it progresses for a while and then get a blood sample.\u201d\n\n\nThe doctor then goes over to his lab table to write down some notes and then begins working again with the samples he collected from you earlier.\n\n\nOver the next few hours, you watch the zombie slowly get bigger and bigger. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s filling up with gas or something. Its skin is now ballooned out so far in every direction, that the bars of the cell actually disappear well into his flesh where his arms are trapped, and he looks as if he\u2019s been inflated to the point of near exploding. He\u2019s long since expanded past the point of tearing out of his clothes and garbles and froths at the mouth as he stands there, pressed up against the bars and outer wall of the building.\n\n\nYou suddenly get a really bad feeling about the thing. It looks like it could actually explode with significant force at any moment. You begin to wonder however, what such an explosion would do to the bars and back wall of the building. If it was forceful enough, maybe you could escape out the hole, in the confusion following the blast. You\u2019re only on the second floor, so the fall isn\u2019t a problem. It would be the streets full of zombies that would be the real challenge. Maybe you could get through a window into the adjacent building to escape them.\n\n\nAnything has to be better than staying here and getting killed by the mad doctor\u2019s crazy experiments!\n\n\nLooking, you see that the doctor is still engrossed in his work, while the officer on watch is busy reading a magazine and not paying you very close attention.", "action_results": [{"action": "Flip your rack and take cover behind the mattress", "result": "You flip your rack over and hunker down behind it, against the far side of the cell \u2013 as far from the bloated zombie as you can get.\n\n\n\u201cHey!

The officer draws his taser and is about to walk toward your position, when Doctor Helisenko goes over to the fat ballooned up arms sticking through the bars.\n\n\nThe officer hesitates, not wanting to leave the doctor alone and unguarded with the zombie. \u201cWhoa, what about the zombie?\u201d he asks the doctor.\n\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s impossible for him to bite us through the bars,\u201d the doctor replies, \u201cand besides, he can barely even move at this point.

You are taken aback by what you see next.\n\n\nThe area is completely splattered in streaming red blood and bits of the zombie; and you can see a bloody crater in the floor, under where the zombie used to be standing. Part of the back wall of the building has also blown out; and the bars between the two cells are now broken and twisted. Strange fizzing blood fills the bottom of the crater, boiling itself into a steamy red vapor that now fills the lab \u2013 and reeks of rotting flesh with a harsh acidic edge.\n\n\nLooking at the doctor and officer, you see their clothing being eaten away by the red splashes of zombie blood, and then they start screaming \u2013 as their skin starts to bubble and sag, suddenly falling from their bones in great swaths. It looks like the blood itself is some kind of flesh eating acid.\n\n\nThe red mist filling the lab isn\u2019t so pleasant either, and it makes your lungs and exposed skin burn like they\u2019re on fire. You better get the hell out of here fast!\n\n\nLooking, you see that the bars where the zombie was standing have been displaced enough by the explosion that you could squeeze through into the other cell \u2013 where the back wall of the building has been blown out.

Your equipment is out there in the lab as well.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much of this gas you can take, but you really could use that shotgun and your equipment, before leaving. As you consider risking a dash for your equipment first, you suddenly hear men running into the infirmary just outside the lab. Shit!

Damn! They took all the good stuff!\n\n\nAll that\u2019s left is your rope, melee weapon, watch, cell phone, small tarp, keys with the small led penlight, and empty Pepsi bottles. Those rotten bastards even took the $50 cash from your wallet. At least the photo of your family is still here; and all of your credit cards. You guess that the \u2018plastic\u2019 isn\u2019t of much use to them in the zombie apocalypse.\n\n\nYou are just getting the last of your gear, when you hear a voice come over the officer\u2019s handheld radio, still on his desk.\n\n\n\u201cWe have a biohazard situation on the second floor!

Somehow they see you through half-melted eyeballs and lurch hungrily toward you.\n\n\nYou level the shotgun and blow both of their heads off \u2013 one right after the other. You then abruptly hear angry wailing from just outside the lab; and then three more zombies in officer uniforms, stumble into the lab through the steel doors. Holy shit! The gas must contain the zombie virus and is turning anyone exposed to it into zombies!\n\n\nYou don\u2019t wait for the three zombies to come after you however, and are already rushing into your cell by that point.\n\n\nShutting the door to your cell behind you, you carefully make your way through the twisted bars between the cells, and go over to the hole in the back wall to look out.\n\n\nYou see a twelve foot gap between the police precinct house and the adjacent city courthouse. A very tall curtained window on the courthouse side, directly across from you, has been blown in by the blast. While you can\u2019t see past the curtains, you figure the tall windows along that side of the building must lead into large courtrooms.\n\n\nIf you take a running start from inside the cell, you should be able to jump straight across the gap and into the window on the other side. If the courthouse isn\u2019t so full of the walking dead that you get eaten alive before you can make it out of there\u2026 well, then you should be OK.\n\n\nLooking down, you note that like the streets, the walkway between the two buildings is also thoroughly packed with zombies. They have reacted to the shower of concrete and broken glass that fell down on their heads from the explosion \u2013 reaching up at you now and gnashing their teeth hungrily.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not them that you\u2019re worried about however; it\u2019s the snipers on the roof. With the call already gone out over the radio, you know that they\u2019ll be looking down over the side to see what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nJust then, you hear automatic gunfire from outside the lab, followed by more voices over your radio \u2013 \u201cOne down. Moving into the lab now\u2026\u201d\n\n\nKnowing that you have no other choice, you move back and take a running start \u2013 jumping across the gap. About halfway across, you realize that you are going to fall a little short. Fortunately, you are able to kick your feet out in front of you and grab hold of the window sill with your hands as you come down. Hanging from the sill with your feet on the wall below you allows you to quickly push yourself up and into the window.\n\n\nAs you are crossing the sill into the room beyond, you abruptly hear a loud crack echo through the gap between the buildings and feel something graze past your waist. Damn \u2013 the sniper almost took you out! Lucky for you he\u2019s not the best shot!\n\n\nYou drop into a large empty courtroom and roll away from the window. As you move across the courtroom towards the exits, you head more gunfire from across the gap \u2013 as the riot team enters the lab and dispatches the other three zombies.\n\n\nChecking your ammo, you see that you only have two shells left. Not nearly enough!

Using your light, you see that you are coming out of courtroom \u2018G\u2019. Following the hall, you see that it leads to a large open landing off a fancy flight of ornate marble stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, you can see the glass entry doors to the courthouse and the metal detectors used to screen people as they would come in.\n\n\nWhile you don\u2019t see any zombies up here on the second floor with you, the first floor around the doors is choked with a number of them, apparently trapped in the building. Even if you could somehow get past them and through the front doors, the streets out in front of the courthouse are impassible with the undead.\n\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to find another way out. Perhaps if you can make your way to the far side of the building, you can get down into less crowded streets. You cautiously make your way past the upper landing and into the other wing of the courthouse. Along the way, you pass a water cooler. It still has enough water in it that you can fill your empty Pepsi bottles and satisfy your current thirst.\n\n\nAs you fill up on the water, you happen to notice a dry-cleaning bag, hanging off a coatrack visible through the window of a nearby attorney\u2019s office. Cautiously heading inside, you find a really expensive suit hanging on the rack \u2013 fresh from the cleaners. It\u2019s a lot less conspicuous than an orange prison jumpsuit, so you take the time to change into it. For someone else\u2019s tailored suit, it fits well enough; the guy must have been close to your build. You forgo putting on the tie however, but still take it anyway (as it might come in handy for tying something up).\n\n\nThen passing down a hall of more legal offices, you arrive at the end of the west corridor and enter a large library of sorts, filled with volumes and volumes of law books and old case files. Looking beyond the stacks, you see a window on the northwest side of the library, near a bank of ancient-looking microfiche machines. Man, you though those went out of style ages ago!\n\n\nMaking your way to the window, you see that is can be opened from the inside.\n\n\nYou open the window to lean out for a good look at the area below. The window opens above a municipal parking lot off a small backstreet behind the courthouse.

You are looking for a manhole cover, or some other way to get yourself out of this horrible nightmare.\n\n\nComing around the back end of a delivery van, you abruptly run into a zombie dressed in the black robes of a judge. Shit! The thing was crouched down in the darkness behind the van, munching on the bones of some stray corpse!

The only thing you can think of at the moment, is to jump into the nearest car and lock the doors. The zombies crowd in around you and angrily pound and scratch at the glass. You know it\u2019s only a matter of moments before they break in and drag you to your doom!\n\n\nIf only there was some way to hide from their sight. The damn things are so stupid, that they\u2019d eventually forget why they were trying to get into the car and wander back into the streets.

One of the dirty bastards has leaned into a window far enough to sink its teeth into you.\n\n\nYou grit through the pain and kick your legs violently to shake it off and then pull your legs in. Spinning around in the cramped space, you reach out to pull the back seat up into place, to lock yourself in the trunk.

Eventually you fall into more of an uneasy doze than anything else.\n\n\nYou awake early the next morning and see on your watch that it\u2019s 7:03 am. For some reason, you find yourself thinking about your wife Laura and two daughters, ten year old Jessica and seven year old Kate. That is when you realize that your memory is starting to return. You suddenly remember everything about your life up to a week ago last Thursday. For whatever reason, you\u2019re still missing the last little bit.\n\n\nWho are you anyway?\n\n\nYou are Greg Bradley. You live in the suburbs with your wife, girls, and one cat; and work in the city as an accountant for the Morgan Corporation \u2013 an advertising firm. Monday through Friday you catch a commuter train in the suburbs to Fairmont Station in the city, where you hop on the Green Subway Line to the Summit Tower Station. Your commute takes about forty-five minutes. On weekends you like to just be with your family, but do go mountain-biking a couple of times a year with friends you\u2019ve had since college. You and your wife used to go camping quite frequently, but that sort of dropped off after your first daughter was born. Your life is nothing special, but for a moment you treasure each memory \u2013 having until just recently had none to treasure at all.\n\n\nYou were an only child of parents who divorced when you were young. You went with your mother at that time; who is still alive, but now lives in a New England nursing home with Alzheimer\u2019s. Your father was an alcoholic and died of liver failure. Your wife\u2019s parents are both still alive, still married, and live in sunny Arizona. They fly you and the family out to their ranch every Christmas, along with the rest of their own family. Your wife has many brothers and sisters, but you really don\u2019t interact with them very much (except over the holiday) and don\u2019t even know all of their names. And that has nothing to do with you losing your memory; you just never cared enough to make the effort.\n\n\nYes, it has all come back except for a missing week. The last thing you remember before waking up in the subway tunnel was leaving your office on Thursday to get on the elevator on the 24th floor of the Summit Tower. You take the keys out of your pocket and look at your elevator key \u2013 the one marked \u2018ST 24\u2019. It\u2019s for the express elevator that goes straight to the Morgan Corporation offices.\n\n\nYou then think about your situation. You were a boy-scout and have some basic survival skills, including being able to handle firearms \u2013 or at least you know how to shoot skeet with a shotgun. How much different can blasting zombies in the head be? Now if you could only get your hands on one (the shotgun, not the zombie, you smirk to yourself)\u2026\n\n\nYou also worry greatly for your family. Your wife would be home \u2013 hopefully barricaded in, while your girls would have been on the bus to school at the time of the outbreak. Damn! You hope they at least made it to the school, knowing that in such an emergency the school would initiate a lockdown. Maybe they are safe inside waiting for help. You hope so.\n\n\nRisking a look out from your place of refuge, you pop open the back seat and slowly take a peek. Fortunately for you, the zombies have (for the most part) all wandered back to the streets, leaving only a few strays wandering here and there in the parking lot. You should be able to avoid them easier in the daylight, now that you can see.\n\n\nIn hindsight, you wish that you had originally waited until daylight to come down into the parking lot, as there are far more zombies in the area than you had initially thought. You are still close enough to the police precinct house, where the zombies are all being attracted to, that the streets are completely packed with them. You \u2019re definitely going to need to find a manhole to go down if you want any chance of getting out of here alive.\n\n\nGathering your gear and slowly creeping out of the car, you look around and find a manhole cover on the far side of the parking lot. The problem with the manhole is that it\u2019s got the front of a car parked over it. Man, you never would have spotted that at night.\n\n\nThe front door of the car parked over the manhole is open, which probably means the vehicle\u2019s battery is dead \u2013 not that you\u2019d actually want to start it; and once again attract all the zombies to your position. Still, you could shift it into neutral and push the car silently back enough from the manhole that you could open it up and get in.\n\n\nYou figure you have a decent chance of pulling it off. And at least this particular manhole cover won\u2019t have a sniper or two waiting above to pick you off as you try to get near it.\n\n\nKeeping low, you carefully maneuver past the one or two zombies still in the parking lot and arrive at the car. You see that you only need to push it back a couple of inches to get access to the manhole cover.\n\n\nClimbing into the car, you note that the keys are still in it. You try to shift the car into neutral, but the shifter won\u2019t budge. You realize that you\u2019ll need to turn the key first to unlock the mechanism. Carefully turning the key just enough to free the shifter, while not starting the engine itself, you are surprised to hear the car suddenly bing loudly \u2013 indicating that the door is open.\n\n\nShit! The zombies near the parking lot suddenly perk up and begin turning toward the sound of the noise! Cursing, you throw the car into neutral and turn off the key. Scrambling out of the car, you see about a dozen zombies slowly wandering in your direction. They haven\u2019t seen you yet \u2013 or they wouldn\u2019t just be wandering slowly (and there would be a lot more of them coming), so you at least have that in your favor.\n\n\nWith only moments to act, you decide to:", "action_results": [{"action": "Move the car now and try to get down the manhole before they get to you", "result": "You rush to the front of the car (against natural instinct to go any other way) and heave it back a few inches, just enough to try to pry up the manhole cover.

Damn, you\u2019ve been down in this hole longer than you thought.\n\n\nContinuing on a little farther, you suddenly notice a shaft of light streaming down into the tunnel ahead from above. Stopping to look, you see that the tunnel opens into a small, twenty by twenty foot, square camber ahead with a raised ledge (about three feet above the level of the water) surrounding the perimeter. A rung ladder climbs up from the ledge to a four foot diameter shaft that ascends well over a hundred feet, to an open manhole cover above.\n\n\nYou note a fresh air tube hanging down the shaft from above and a yellow hardhat on the ledge underneath it \u2013 and a huge splatter of blood, as if someone recently fell down the open manhole. Listening, you can hear moaning sounds coming from the darkness of the tunnel beyond the square chamber. Shit. City workers must have been working down this manhole at the time of the outbreak. That means the manhole cover has been open the whole time. No telling how many zombies have stumbled down into it since then\u2026\n\n\nListening, you hear the moaning again and it sounds like two or three zombies in the tunnel up ahead, this time drawing closer \u2013 but it\u2019s not the harried desperate sound of hungry zombies zeroing in on you just yet.

The zombies huff and groan, not yet aware of your presence. You end that quickly however, as you look out from the side tunnel and see that there is indeed only two of them \u2013 and one is actually dragging itself bodily across the ground; its hips and legs apparently shattered from a fall down the manhole. Both are bitten up pretty good and covered in blood and grime.\n\n\nYou note that they are dressed as city sewer workers, in brown work overalls with green reflective vests and hip-wader boots. The zombie dragging itself across the floor also wears a yellow hardhat, while the standing one doesn\u2019t have one. Chances are that the hardhat on the ledge belongs to him.\n\n\nAs you look out, the lead zombie sees you and lurches forward, baring its crimson-stained teeth. As it reaches for you in typical zombie fashion (arms outstretched to the front), it\u2019s an easy matter to burry your crowbar in its unprotected skull. A splurch of something akin in both texture and smell to chunky curdled milk hits you in the face as its head explodes. It falls to its knees dead and you kick it over into the flow of filthy brown sewer water to watch the current sweep it away.\n\n\nThe other zombie meanwhile, crawls toward you with a visible hunger. You raise your weapon and wait until it draws near enough to cave the back of its head in with a single powerful blow. Wiping the splatter off your face, you gather your gear and resume your journey down the dark sewer main.\n\n\nYou pass five more intersections of the smaller side tunnels and continue on for a while, before noticing that there have not been any further manhole shafts since the last open one with the two zombies. That, and it also looks like the side tunnels have stopped running into the main tunnel. From here on out, it\u2019s just going to be the main line.\n\n\nThinking about the area, you know that you are getting close to the Indian River. The Indian River is a wide river-way (almost a full mile across), that separates the city from the suburbs. A number of bridges cross over the river up and down its length; and there is also an abandoned ferry station and boating club on the river itself.\n\n\nThe main sewer line probably dumps out right into the river. If you can follow it that far, then you can get out on the river and follow the water\u2019s edge west a few blocks to get up onto the freeway that crosses over the Veteran\u2019s Bridge from the suburbs. You could also stay on the waterfront itself and check out the boat club for any boats that might still be there. While you don\u2019t think you could actually make the swim across the river in your current condition, you could definitely make it across in a boat.\n\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the danger of the water level in the sewer main getting too high further along to be passable.\n\n\nGiven that, you decide:", "action_results": [{"action": "To press forward through the sewer main to the river", "result": "You press forward through the sewer main towards the river.

With your footing compromised, you suddenly slip \u2013 falling into the flow of surprisingly cold sewer water.\n\n\nTrying to get yourself out of the water proves futile, as the current is too fast and the sides of the tunnel are incredibly slippery when wet. You watch the water level continue to rise higher and higher as you wash along. Even if you could climb out of the water now, you would have a hard time moving through the tunnel on the steep slope of what\u2019s left of the side.

Before your breath runs out however, you manage to kick swim yourself out of the current and come back up on the surface. It smells terrible out here on the river \u2013 not just from the sewage spewing freely into the river, but also the smell of dead fish and an odd chemical smell. You also note a rainbow colored slick across the surface of the water and frothy clumps of gray foam lapping up on the nearby shore.\n\n\nYou swim to the shore and crouch low, not seeing any zombies on the rocky embankment \u2013 at least you managed to hold onto most of your gear.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "You are sitting on the rocky embankment running the length of the north shore of the Indian River.

Observing the shore itself, you notice hundreds of dead fish floating among the gray froth lapping up against the rocks. As you stand there, a body also floats by in the water \u2013 perhaps another zombie from the sewer main.\n\n\nLooking up and down the river, you see a number of large concrete pipes \u2013 all dumping stuff into the river. You never noticed this before, when crossing the river on the train or in your car, and wonder if it has something to do with the city\u2019s power being down for so long.\n\n\nYou also see the large stone pier of the abandoned ferry station about a quarter of a mile upriver to the west. Just on the other side of that would be the Indian River boat club. Beyond that, about two more miles upriver, you see the highway and Veteran\u2019s Bridge, where it crosses the river. Something is wrong however, and looking at the length of the bridge, you see that the center has collapsed out of it \u2013 one end actually dipping at a steep angle into the river itself. You can even make out a few vehicles still on that section of the bridge and imagine there must have been many more, but that they all slid right into the river when the bridge went down.\n\n\nLooking downriver to the east, you see the silhouette of the Parkway Bridge about five or six miles away. It too has been demolished and no longer crosses the entire span of the river. You wonder if all the bridges crossing the Indian River were blown, in an attempt to contain the zombie virus. God, you can only hope it worked\u2026\n\n\nThen you remember your morning train rides into the city and recall that the train had its own bridge not too far to the west of the Veteran\u2019s Bridge. Turning to look back upriver to the west, you see past Veteran\u2019s bridge itself and spot the train bridge a mile or so beyond. From here, you can\u2019t see the entire length of the train bridge, but you don\u2019t see any gaps in it.

You might have been able to do it when you were younger and in shape for it \u2013 but not now, and not all beat to hell from the get-go.\n\n\nYou then climb up to the top of the embankment and see a lonely road following the edge of the river. It\u2019s empty of both vehicles and zombies, so you get up on it and cautiously begin walking.

A metal gate would drop down and cars would drive off the ferry, then the waiting cars would be loaded on.\n\n\nThe building is not much more than standing rust now and the lanes running down the pier have faded in the elements. You know from your youth that the pier is actually hollow inside. You remember discovering it as a kid, when on a class trip to the city \u2013 when you and some other boys found a secret way in and snuck under there to smoke cigarettes, while the rest of the class was waiting for the next boat. Looking now, you note small barred openings in the upper sides of the stone pier along its length. You remember light streaming into the space under the pier through those openings in the thick stone wall.\n\n\nWalking out onto the pier, you look west down the rocky embankment along the river. From here you can see the boat club on the west side of the ferry station, about a hundred yards upriver \u2013 and not a single boat in any of its seven floating docks \u2013 unless you count the blackened burned down hulls of a large trawler and three sailboats near the charred remains of the dock\u2019s fueling station.\n\n\nIt looks like there was a huge fight down there on the docks \u2013 and not between humans and zombies \u2013 but between people.

As an animal hospital, they would stock all sorts of drugs and medical supplies for the various animal surgeries. If you can figure out a way around both the zombies and \u2018man-eating\u2019 dog pack, you might be able to recover some truly valuable supplies \u2013 maybe even the antibiotics you need to beat this infection\u2026\n\n\nYou decide to:", "action_results": [{"action": "Go under the chain-link fence and circle wide around the parking lot to get into the front of veterinary clinic, while the dogs distract the zombies", "result": "You move to one of the posts in the chain-link fence and pop the lowest sets of wire clips off.

As you go, the dogs continue to distract the zombies. You wonder for a moment which you fear more \u2013 the zombies or the dogs. Probably still the zombies, as the dogs would only be interested in attacking the weakest prey, rather than one that would fight back. You hope however, that you don\u2019t run into a wild dog pack when there are no zombies around for them to choose over you\u2026\n\n\nChecking the front door to the clinic, you find that it is locked.

You note that the \u2018dog and zombie show\u2019 in the parking lot is still making a lot of noise, so breaking the glass out of the front door doesn\u2019t seem like too great a risk. You jab the glass quickly with the pointiest end of your weapon and watch it shatter completely into thousands of small uniform pieces.\n\n\nThe ruckus in the parking lot does not stop, but a mid-sized dog with red-stained paws and jowls does suddenly come over from the pack to investigate the sound. It sees you, but when you wave your weapon at it menacingly, it turns around quickly to go back to its pack.\n\n\nSlipping in through the busted out door, you enter a small foyer with a coatrack and another glass door leading into the veterinary clinic waiting room. The inner door is unlocked and you\u2019re glad to have at least one closed door between you and the zombies, should the dogs move on and leave the zombie hoard to its own once again.\n\n\nGoing in the clinic and looking around, you see that the foyer enters into a large waiting room, with a counter to one side, a wall of various animal feed and toys on the other side, and a row of waiting chairs in between. A single closed door exits the waiting area, heading deeper into the building.\n\n\nDriven by hunger and a little curiosity, you go over to the feed section and look at some of the items on display. There are sacks and cans of food for various kinds of animals. You note some tins of 100% natural dog foods. Hmm, beef and chicken with vegetables\u2026 precooked and ready to serve\u2026 Shit, the dogs aren\u2019t going to need it\u2026 You load up on as many tins as you can comfortably carry with the rest of your gear.\n\n\nHeading over to the door exiting the waiting room, you give a listen and don\u2019t hear anything on the other side. Opening it reveals a hallway heading past two surgical suites, a supply room, and a pet washing station, to a cage and pen area at the far rear of the building. Moving in, you check out each area as you go along. In the surgical suites you find a variety of useful medical supplies, including bandages, gauze, wraps and tape, medical tools, suture kits, scissors, scalpels, syringes, antiseptic, saline IV bags, and sterile water. You grab a bottle of sterile water and drink it down. It certainly tastes \u2018sterile\u2019 all right, but at least it\u2019s refreshing. You find a large medical bag as well and fill it with as much as you can manage.\n\n\nMoving down to the supply area, you find all sorts of stuff, mostly unopened packs of what you just found in the surgical suites, but also more animal feed, some administrative items, and two large locked drug cabinets; one of which is also some sort of refrigeration unit \u2013 though it has been without power for some time now.

The breathing is larger and deeper \u2013 like a bear or mountain lion\u2026\n\n\nVery quietly, you peek around the corner and see a number of smashed and ripped-open pens and cages scattered all over the place. Bones and tufts of fur are all that remain of whatever animals were once in them. Along the outer wall of the building is a long row of dog kennels with door flaps leading to fenced runs outside the building itself. All of the bars to the kennels are bent or completely broken open; and bloody splashes on the walls and floor within, indicate the fate of the once occupants. The farthest kennel on the right however, while ripped open, shows no signs of blood. Perhaps that is because it is for a smaller dog type, and the door flap leading out is only a foot high and a few inches wide. The occupant, if there was one, either escaped out the flap \u2013 or was swallowed whole \u2013 by whatever caused so much carnage here in the clinic.\n\n\nYou look toward the sound of heavy breathing and wait for your eyes to adjust to the shadows.

You can\u2019t help but laugh when you see him \u2013 even though it snaps hungrily at you and tries to lunge forward. It falls flat on its face however, as being dragged behind the car has taken the feet and skin right off him below the knees. You stop laughing and do what must be done \u2013 splitting his skull wide with one solid blow.\n\n\nYou then slide the body out of the garage with your foot and wait (what seems like forever) for the garage door to come down all the way. You definitely want it to finish closing, before any of the other zombies get close enough to get under it and make it automatically go up again. You give a huge sigh of relief, as the last few inches of the gap disappear under the door and it seals itself tight.\n\n\nListening, you can hear the zombie hordes clamber into the streets outside, some scraping and bumping against the garage door in the press to discover where the car just went. Fortunately, they can\u2019t see you directly and are not actively trying to tear their way into the garage at the moment. Creeping to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek out and see at least a hundred or more walking dead crowding the end of the cul-de-sac. Great\u2026 how long is it going to take for them to get bored and wander off again?\n\n\nIt then suddenly occurs to you that Abby hasn\u2019t gotten out of the car yet. You go look through the passenger window and see her slumped unconscious in the seat with a mess of spit-up blood staining the front of her shirt. Oh shit, you think to yourself \u2013 here it comes\u2026\n\n\nShe seemed a little quiet as you were coming down the lane and must have finally succumbed to her bite as you were around the back of the car taking care of business and waiting for the garage door to come down. That means that she\u2019s going to zom-out on you at any moment. You open her door, shove the haft of your crowbar into her slack-open jaws and reach across to unbuckle her. And it\u2019s a good thing you do too, because her eyes \u2013 glazed over with the look of the dead \u2013 snap open abruptly; and she leans forward to snap at you with a vicious growl, but doesn\u2019t get anywhere with a mouth full of iron.\n\n\nYou then step back and violently yank her out of the car by the hair. As she falls to the ground and scrambles to get back up, you rip your weapon free of her teeth and finish her off with a number of solids cracks to the head. As blood starts to pool under her broken corpse, you sigh heavily and grab a painter\u2019s cloth off a shelf to cover the body.\n\n\nPutting the poor girl out of your mind, you taking a mental inventory of the stuff in your garage and see that you have plenty of supplies to take with you and your family to get out of the suburbs and into more rural areas. Moving cautiously to the door leading into the house from the garage, you slowly turn the knob and crack the door just enough to peer through. You don\u2019t see anyone on the first floor, but the front door is broken open, the windows are busted out, and bloody tracks are everywhere. The place is a wreck and looks looted on top of it all \u2013 as you can see that all the cabinet doors in the kitchen are swung open and bare.\n\n\nYou think about your wife and wonder if she (or anyone) could possibly have survived all this. You want so badly to call out her name, but know that would be a very bad idea. You\u2019re going to have to be extra stealthy here, if you want to get the two of you out of this alive. (Not that driving your car into the garage with a huge mob of zombies in tow was the best way to start a stealth mission \u2013 but that\u2019s all water under the bridge now\u2026) You pull out the cell phone and check for a signal \u2013 nothing! You can\u2019t even call her to see if she\u2019s still in danger...\n\n\nAs you consider your options, it occurs to you that your neighbor on the garage-side of your house was an avid gun collector. Maybe he\u2019s still alive and barricaded in his house. Maybe you could try to sneak over there first and get a weapon and ammo from him. Maybe he knows what happened to your wife and family. Maybe your wife even tried to go over there during the initial outbreak. Quietly shutting the interior door and moving back to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek back out again and look over toward your neighbor\u2019s home. It doesn\u2019t look promising at all.\n\n\nLike the rest of the houses on the cul-de-sac, it too is broken open on the first floor, but you do see something different. As you look closer, you can see that his lawn is a sea of shot-up corpses and that there are signs of a breached barricading around his front door and windows. It looks like the old guy tried to make a stand but was eventually overrun. But where is he now?

They would still be at their school in lockdown (assuming their bus made it that far before the outbreak). If your wife managed to stay barricaded in this long, then hopefully the school would too.

God, are you too late?!?\n\n\nWith a large number of zombies following the sound of your vehicle into the area, you stop at the end of the lane, turn the car off, and leap out with weapon in hand to head around the vehicle and deal with the hanger-on. It\u2019s a zombie all right, but a middle-aged one and completely naked except for a speedo bathing suit. How the hell you missed him in the crowd you\u2019ll never know!\n\n\nThe guy really has no business wearing a speedo and certainly not as a zombie! You can\u2019t help but laugh when you see him \u2013 even though it snaps hungrily at you and tries to lunge forward. It falls flat on its face however, as being dragged behind the car has taken the feet and skin right off him below the knees. You stop laughing and do what must be done \u2013 splitting his skull wide with one solid blow.\n\n\nAbby comes around the car to join you and remarks \u201cEuw,\u201d but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a reference to the mess you just made, or to a middle-aged zombie in a speedo. Then looking, the two of you can see the zombie hordes clambering down the street toward you, but you are far enough ahead of them, that it is easy to slip between the houses and disappear from their view.\n\n\nQuickly heading through the backyards of the houses off the lane and then into the one of the backyards of the houses off your own lane, you and Abby are astonished to see an older woman in a nightgown standing in the yard with a zombie on a leash \u2013 like she was out walking a dog or something!\n\n\nThe woman, who is clearly a living person, is yelling at the tall, broad-shouldered, and slightly chubby zombie with a dog-lead around its neck.\n\n\n\u201cMove it Bo!\u201d she scolds, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there! You got to get some exercise if you want to get better!\u201d\n\n\nThe zombie meanwhile, just stands there dumbly, and moans like it doesn\u2019t feel up to the challenge. What\u2019s completely unbelievable about the whole thing, is that the zombie is actually being submissive and not trying to rip the old women to shreds.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d you yell as you approach \u2013 \u201cGet inside! There\u2019s a crowd of zombies coming!\u201d\n\n\nThe woman, initially surprised by your sudden appearance, then glares at you angrily and yells back, wagging her finger \u2013 \u201cYou were supposed to bring medicine for my son! Where is the medicine?!?\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 Clearly, the old woman has lost it. You try one more time to help, but don\u2019t stop hurrying across the yard. \u201cGo inside lady! Zombies are coming!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou dirty son of a bitch!\u201d the woman spits at you angrily \u2013 and you know there\u2019s no helping her. The zombie on the leash meanwhile, just moans curiously at the situation, and continues to stand there passively.\n\n\n\u201cWe got to get out of here now!\u201d Abby says, motioning back the way you just came.\n\n\nLooking back, you see dozens of zombies closing in toward you from around the houses on the lane where you parked the car. Shit \u2013 if they follow close enough to see you go into your house you\u2019re going to get swarmed. You make a quick adjustment to your plans and run, with Abby close behind, from the crazy woman\u2019s yard to the end of the cul-de-sac and into the wooded area behind the houses. From here, the two of you can make your way around through the trees to your own back yard and then into your house through the rear.\n\n\nAs you flee the scene, the zombies come in and pull the old woman down \u2013 savaging her body with their horrible bloodstained teeth. She screams out in anguish once and then goes silent; while \u201cBo\u201d the zombie on a leash just stands there watching, completely ignored by the rest of the undead. For what it\u2019s worth, at least she distracted the ravenous horde from pursuing you momentarily.\n\n\nMoving closer to your house, you pass by your neighbor\u2019s house on the garage-side of your own home and suddenly remember that he was an avid gun collector.

Maybe your wife even tried to go over there during the initial outbreak.\n\n\nMoving close enough to the edge of the trees to look out into your neighbor\u2019s backyard, you see that like the rest of the houses on the cul-de-sac, it too is broken open on the first floor, but you do see something different. First, his lawn is a sea of shot-up corpses all around the house; and second, there are signs of a breached barricading around his doors and windows. It looks like the old guy tried to make a stand but was eventually overrun. But where is he now? And if he was overrun and killed \u2013 then his weapons might still be in the house\u2026\n\n\nLooking toward your own home, you see that it too is broken open and that the back door off your deck is currently standing wide open. Looking between the two houses and into the street out front, you can also see a few zombies beginning to wander into the cul-de-sac from the other parts of the neighborhood.\n\n\nYou think about your wife and wonder if she (or anyone) could possibly have survived all this. Being this close to your house, you want so badly to call out her name, but know that would be a very bad idea. You\u2019re going to have to be extra stealthy here, if you want to get the two of you out of this alive. You then pull out the cell phone and check for a signal \u2013 nothing! You can\u2019t even call her to see if she\u2019s still in danger...\n\n\nThat\u2019s when you abruptly realize that Abby is not with you anymore. Shit! What happened to her? You look back the way you came and can see her staggering slowly among the trees. She\u2019s looking around, but something is not right about the way she\u2019s doing so \u2013 it\u2019s not like a person looking for another person they just lost in the woods. Crouching low to keep out of sight, you observe her continuing to stager from tree to tree, almost falling over as she stumbles over the uneven ground. Her movements are jerky and erratic and sadly, you see that she has puked blood up all over the front of her shirt.\n\n\nShe moans balefully and you have no doubt that she has finally succumbed to her zombie bite.

From here, you can make your way around through the trees to your own back yard and then into your house through the rear.\n\n\nAs you flee the scene, the zombies come in and pull the old woman down \u2013 savaging her body with their horrible bloodstained teeth. She screams out in anguish once and then goes silent; while \u201cBo\u201d the zombie on a leash just stands there watching, completely ignored by the rest of the undead.

In a flash, its front paws slam into you and topple you over, as your weapon bounces ineffectively off the side of its bone-plated head. The thing is instantly upon you, and you barely manage to shove the haft of the crowbar into its snapping fang-crowded jaws as it lunges for your throat! There is a loud cracking sound, as the weight of it on your chest begins to snap your ribs.

Lying in a corner just to your right, amid almost a nest-like pile of twisted cage fragments is a huge crimson abomination of some sort.

The fact that the monster is sleeping, leads you to believe that it is a living creature, rather than undead. That probably means that it can be killed. Still, what the hell caused it mutate into what slumbers before you?

Good luck though, finding someplace not completely looted already and swarming with zombies.\n\n\nArriving at the top of the hillside, you and the boy come to a five foot high stone wall. Carefully taking a look over the wall, you see an expansive walled cemetery on the other side. Rows and rows of headstones and markers cross a quarter mile wide field, running almost a half mile in length. Large mausoleums, shrines, and memorials dot the area, amid small clusters of trees and decorative shrubbery. A fancy cobblestone road winds its way through the rows, to allow vehicles to dive through the various sections.\n\n\nYou note the high grass, which seems out of place here; even though you know that no one in their right mind would be out mowing it in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Speaking of zombies, you don\u2019t see any in the cemetery itself. The place is empty. You half expect to see zombies clawing their way out of the very ground, but the place is undefiled and calm.\n\n\nLooking across to the far side, you can see a number of wrought-iron gates set at even intervals in the stone wall. The gates are all closed. Beyond them, you can see that a main road runs alongside the cemetery, but because of the wall, you cannot see from here whether there are any vehicles on it. You do note some movement in that direction however, and spot a small number of zombies wandering around outside the wall. A quick \u2018head count\u2019 tallies seven zombies in sight. It\u2019s a nice change from the hundreds and thousands you\u2019ve seen on the other side of the river.

It must be the groundskeeper\u2019s home. You help Jacob over the wall, follow after, and begin heading in that direction. If you can get to the main road beyond the house unseen, you might be able to get your hands on a vehicle.

The sound of the hearse will attract the zombies to you; so keep going to draw them away from the gate, so my daughter can close it again without being overrun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d you say, looking out at the road following along the south side of the cemetery. There really aren\u2019t a whole lot of zombies out there right now, so it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to get the hearse out safely.\n\n\n\u201cOh, and there\u2019s an empty casket in the back of the hearse,\u201d the old man adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about trying to take it out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOK, thanks for the help and good luck to you and your family,\u201d you say, ready to head to the garage.\n\n\n\u201cGood luck to you too,\u201d the old man replies.\n\n\nThen heading to the garage, you open the left bay and see the hearse within. It\u2019s an ancient-looking thing right out of the sixties. A sleek black four-door station wagon-style Buick hearse; solid steel; at least twenty-five feet long; with white curtained windows, a swing out door in the back, and long shiny fins on the end. Damn.\n\n\nLoading your gear in the back seats \u2013 yes it has a set of front and back bench seats \u2013 you see a set of curtains behind them leading back into the casket bay. Taking a look behind the curtains, you see a large white enameled casket strapped down inside. Creepy.\n\n\nHopping in and closing the doors, you look at the black leather seats and note that there are no seatbelts. That and the dashboard is a full three feet of solid steel and that there is no rearview mirror \u2013 except for a small round side-mirror on the driver\u2019s side only. At least it\u2019s got an automatic transmission, with the gearshift off the steering column.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "You turn the key and start up the hearse. It sounds pretty good for a vehicle that\u2019s almost fifty years old. You note that the fuel gauge bounces oddly between full and half a tank though. You probably can\u2019t trust it to be full, but at least there seems to be half a tank. Surly the old man would have told you if it didn\u2019t have enough fuel to get you home\u2026\n\n\nPulling out of the garage, you turn and follow the upper road through the cemetery to the east. Looking, you can see the old man\u2019s daughter Laura waiting by one of the wrought-iron gates on the easternmost side of the graveyard. You also see that the sound of the car does indeed attract the attention of the nearby zombies. You see a small group of them following outside the wall as you head east. You give the old hearse some gas and hurry along, so that you can beat the mob to the gate. You don\u2019t want to risk allowing any into the cemetery when Laura opens the gate to let you out.\n\n\nArriving at the gate, Laura swings one side open and you drive out and turn west onto the road. Laura immediately closes the gate behind you and ducks down out of sight behind the cemetery wall. You see a small mob of eight or so zombies on the road ahead of you lumbering hungrily towards the hearse. Flooring it, you trundle forward and plow through them \u2013 sending bloody zombie parts flying in all directions. The solid-steel, American made, four ton hearse rolls over the bodies like they were nothing more than the neighbor\u2019s dog; and you are suddenly feeling pretty confident about being able to get through the zombie mobs in this rolling juggernaut. Looking in the driver\u2019s side mirror, you only see three of the mangled zombies getting back up. No too shabby, you think to yourself.\n\n\nAs you drive along the road, the old man watches you go from one of the upper windows of the house, and you wonder how long he, his family, and Jacob will be able to survive boarded up in his old stone house. It proves that there are at least some survivors out here in the suburbs; and gives you a glimmer of hope that you\u2019ll find your own family alive after all.\n\n\nArriving at the west end of the cemetery, you turn south onto the main road heading south past a carwash. Unlike the city, you note a distinct lack of gridlock in the streets. There are a few abandoned cars in sight, but they look more like accidents, than simply left due to being unable to move. You should be able to maneuver your way down the roads and around any obstacles in the way without too much trouble.\n\n\nYou also see that there are still plenty of zombies in the streets, but they are spread out in small clusters, rather than giant hordes of hundreds and thousands. The sound of the hearse draws them toward you, but there\u2019s a lot less of them and as long as they don\u2019t get any thicker \u2013 and you are hoping that they will continue to thin out as you head further from the city \u2013 you should be able to drive through them as they are encountered.\n\n\nSo where to now? You wonder to yourself. You should probably go find that drugstore to the west, to get meds for this infection. Thinking about it, you know that there is also a drugstore near your home, but that is at least ten miles away; and you\u2019re not sure how fast this infection is going to progress. Also, there\u2019s probably a high chance that any drugstores you run across will have already been looted. The more you check out, the better chance you have of finding what you need.\n\n\nOf course, you\u2019re also not entirely sure about the fuel situation with this hearse. Who knows what kind of gas mileage it gets even with a half a tank? You probably have enough to get home, but that could be about it. You know that you had just filled up the tank in your own car, just before parking it at the commuter lot on the day of the outbreak.

There are also quite a few vehicles parked along the sides of the road, but they look like they haven\u2019t been moved from their parking spaces at all \u2013 their owners probably never even had the chance.\n\n\nSmall clusters of zombies wander the streets, spread out every few blocks.

Feeling like it fits the moment rather well.\n\n\nThen remembering all the zombies, and that there\u2019s now nothing dissuading them from swarming in on you again, you hurry to collect your gear from the back of the car. Moving to an alley between the rows of townhouses, you hurry to the far end to look east and west down the street. Sure enough, you see small mobs of zombies to the east, hurrying north up the main street towards the car crash. You slip across the road and continue traveling south down between the blocks, until you reach the point you have to turn west.\n\n\nHeading west, you continue on, ducking down here and there along the way to keep out of sight of the scattered mobs of zombies lurking about. You note that the farther west you go, the more crowded the streets are getting with both zombies and abandoned cars. Pretty soon, you are back into gridlocked city streets teaming with wandering dead and realize that you must be close to the highway.\n\n\nSure enough, looking a few blocks further ahead, you can make out the highway overpass itself and the vehicle-choked onramps that lead up to it from the main street. Keeping a low profile, you cautiously move between abandoned cars and make you way through the underpass. From here, it\u2019s only a mile or so to the train station and commuter parking lot where you left your car. You are hoping that the gridlock and zombies will thin out enough by the time you reach it, that you will be able to simply get into your car and drive home. As you head away from the highway however, you don\u2019t really see any let up in either zombies or gridlock and are beginning to have doubts about being able to get your car out on the roads.\n\n\nWhen you finally arrive at the railroad tracks, you see that a commuter train is stopped on the southbound rails crossing the road and is leaning over at a peculiar angle. Getting closer, you can see that the cars of the train are actually being held up by some large vehicles trapped up alongside them. Looking down the tracks to the south, you see that the rest of the cars in that direction have completely derailed and lie flopped over on their sides off the low embankment following the track. Looking back up the tracks in the opposite direction, you see four more cars behind the ones stopped across the road and that they are all still upright on the tracks.\n\n\nYou note a number of completely mangled cars and some dismembered body parts strewn amid the gridlock near the tracks and surmise that the train must have been trying to flee the city, when it ran through vehicles stopped on the tracks and derailed. Incidentally, you don\u2019t see any zombies wandering around in any of the train cars themselves, so you carefully make your way under one of the upright cars, dragging your gear with you, to get past the wreck.\n\n\nArriving on the other side of the train, you are surprised to see the gridlock on this side of the tracks is drastically reduced. Beyond a few more wrecked vehicles along the tracks themselves, you see that the streets are backed up only a few more blocks, before thinning out again. You should be able to get your car and maneuver through the occasional obstacle, until you\u2019re far enough from the city that gridlock and massive zombie hordes will no longer be a factor.\n\n\nYou make your way around the train station to the large commuter parking lot on the other side. Stopping behind some thick hedges against the red brick building, you look out into the parking lot. You see that most of the vehicles that were there, when you left that morning to go to work, are still there. It makes you wonder what became of them all. Has anyone else managed to escape the city of the dead? Or are you the only one.\n\n\nA number of zombies wander aimlessly around the parking lot, apparently deterred from leaving somehow, by the simple orange and white banded toll-arms dropped down across the exits. Even down, you should be able to drive right through those without any problem. You make a quick headcount and tally seventeen zombies in the lot; including a police officer zombie right next to your car. Even so, there are enough cars in the lot that you should be able to stealth your way to the car unseen. Even if the police officer or another zombie ends up blocking the car, you should be able to take it out quick enough to get yourself in and started before the rest can swarm you.\n\n\nRegardless, you look over the exit points in the lot a moment before heading out, to plan ahead a bit. You can see that once you are in your car, you\u2019ll need to take the north exit, where you can see a vehicle-free backstreet not too far away that you can take to bypass the two or three blocks of gridlock on the main road.\n\n\nThinking about the police officer zombie again, you wonder if it still has its sidearm.

Hordes and hordes of the undead still wander among the abandoned cars on the highway sloping down away from the bridge, but there are far less than you would have guessed up the slope itself.\n\n\nIt makes you wonder if all the zombies \u2013 like water \u2013 simply took the path of least resistance and wandered off in a downhill direction away from the bridge. As long as you\u2019re careful, you should be able to crouch low and move through the jam of cars unseen.\n\n\nYou head up the incline a ways and begin looking through the vehicles for anything of use. After about fifteen minutes, you realize just how fast the panic must have spread through the city during the initial outbreak \u2013 as none of the cars contain anything like the supplies you would have hoped for.\n\n\nAll is not a total bust however, as you do score a few bottles of water, a 2-liter of soda pop, and an unopened bag of beef jerky.\n\n\nTaking your loot, you head back to the hole in the chain-link fence, gather your stuff, and then carefully make your way back down onto river road.

Pretty soon, you are back into gridlocked city streets teaming with wandering dead and realize that you must be close to the highway.\n\n\nSure enough, looking a few blocks further ahead, you can make out the highway overpass itself and the vehicle-choked onramps that lead up to it from the main street. You note that a massive horde of zombies has gathered at the bottom of the onramps and in the underpass down on the street level. Damn, there must be close to a thousand of them.

Unfortunately, the plaza looks completely jacked. The pizza shop appears to have burnt down, taking half of the laundromat with it; while all the windows and doors have been smashed out of the dollar store and pharmacy.

It slams off the front of the car, leaving a huge red-splattered dent, and then falls under the driver\u2019s side wheels. As the car bounces violently over the nasty thing, you realize that it ain\u2019t going to be like running over the family dog in this small hatchback, if you hit anymore of them. Too many and you\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll either damage the car beyond drivability \u2013 or simply lose control and crash.\n\n\nLooking farther up the road, you suddenly spot a rather large horde of zombies blocking the entire street up ahead. There are easily a couple hundred of them and it would help explain where all the victims from the townhouses went.\n\n\nRight before the massive horde is a side road heading west. If you can get to it before the horde moves too far forward, you can easily bypass them \u2013 otherwise you might find yourself plowing through them.

You drive on for a handful of blocks and then begin to notice something peculiar happening with the zombies coming out into the streets. They stumble onto the road ahead, but then quickly move away from you as you approach. You strain to see what they are chasing, but don\u2019t see anything \u2013 and surely the aren\u2019t spooked by the car. Traveling a bit further, it happens again, with five zombies near a street corner abruptly bolting away from each other when you drive near.\n\n\nThat\u2019s strange you think; and it reminds you of fish in a school when a predator approaches.

The metal actually buckles-in and the car swerves from the impact. You are just able to keep control of the vehicle, when a number of three foot long spear-like fingers abruptly pierce through the roof and begin peeling the metal back! As the roof begins to roll away from the shattering windshield, you can see one of those demonic women standing on the top of the car \u2013 her freakishly elongated hands shredding the metal like it was butter!\n\n\nShe stares down at you and the boy with blazing black eyes, then wails loudly and tears the rest of the roof completely off the car!\n\n\nJacob screams as you slam on the brakes and watch the she-monster fling forward over the hood of the car \u2013 then floor it, hoping to run the bitch down.

You floor the small hatchback to get some distance between you and the monster, but look back in your mirror to see the she-demon not only get back up, but actually taking massive leaps after you, quickly covering the gap. Looking at your speedometer, you see that you\u2019re doing sixty miles an hour, but the nasty thing catches up and once again bounds onto the car.\n\n\nThis time the creature clamps down on the driver\u2019s side door and rips it right off the car with an angry shriek.

The next thing you know, you are standing outside of the car in some sort of bizarre out of body experience \u2013 watching the she-demon pull your limp body from the car through the smashed out windshield. She lifts it overhead in an almost simian victory display and then slashes open your neck to greedily guzzle the still warm lifeblood flowing from the wound.\n\n\nLooking around, you see that strange black shadowy shape from your unconscious subway dreams lurking nearby.

Even so, you are stunned by violent and abrupt stop, as the airbag deploys in your face and the front of the car crumples suddenly against the tree \u2013 crushing the screeching banshee in-between and pinning her there.\n\n\nYou instinctively check your nose and find that it\u2019s bleeding a little, but not busted.

You move to the far end of the alleyway to look east and west down the street. Sure enough, you see small mobs of zombies to the east, hurrying north up the main street towards the car crash. Still having to carry the boy, you slip across the road and continue traveling south down between the blocks, until you reach the point you have to turn west.\n\n\nBy this point, Jacob is conscious again and cognizant, but cries and complains that his shoulder and head hurts.

Inside, you don\u2019t see or hear any movement, so you open a closet off the entry hall and tell Jacob to hide inside, while you scout around for some medical supplies.\n\n\nJacob goes into the closet and slumps down on the floor, still whimpering from his injuries. You close the door and head to the back of the house, looking for a bathroom. If you\u2019re lucky, there may be some meds in a cabinet or something.\n\n\nArriving in the kitchen, you see blood and gore splattered everywhere. It looks like someone may have made a stand here against the zombies and indeed, you find what looks like a dead zombie with a large chef-knife buried deep in its head, laying on the floor near the refrigerator. As you pass through the kitchen to the archway of the stairs heading up however, you hear a sudden moan coming from the stairs themselves. Damn, a live zombie still in the house!\n\n\nRaising your weapon high, you look around into the stairway and see an old woman belted onto a stair-lift with a huge bloody gash in her neck and all her fingers apparently eaten off. When she sees you, she moans hungrily at you and struggles to get off the stair-lift. Being too stupid to simply unbuckle herself, she presents little threat and it\u2019s an easy (if not gruesome) task to bash her brains in as she conveniently leans over to reach for you.\n\n\nWith the old zombie lady out of the way, you head upstairs and find a bathroom cabinet with all sorts of pills in it. You help yourself to some pain killers, anti-nausea tabs, a small first aid kit, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol.\n\n\nBriefly looking through the rest of the house, you don\u2019t find anything else of much use, except for a number of soup cans down in the kitchen. You grab these on the way out and go to the closet to retrieve Jacob.\n\n\nYou give the boy a painkiller and some anti-nausea tabs. Then cautiously leave the townhouse, doing your best to hold Jacob up as he walks alongside you. After a while, he\u2019s still wobbly, but at least he has stopped crying.\n\n\nHeading west, you continue on, ducking down here and there along the way to keep out of sight of the scattered mobs of zombies lurking about. You note that the farther west you go, the more crowded the streets are getting with both zombies and abandoned cars. Pretty soon, you are back into gridlocked city streets teaming with wandering dead and realize that you must be close to the highway.\n\n\nSure enough, looking a few blocks further ahead, you can make out the highway overpass itself and the vehicle-choked onramps that lead up to it from the main street. Keeping a low profile, you and Jacob cautiously move between abandoned cars and make you way through the underpass. From here, it\u2019s only a mile or so to the train station and commuter parking lot where you left your car. You are hoping that the gridlock and zombies will thin out enough by the time you reach it, that you will be able to simply get into your car and drive home. As you head away from the highway however, you don\u2019t really see any let up in either zombies or gridlock and are beginning to have doubts about being able to get your car out on the roads.\n\n\nWhen you finally arrive at the railroad tracks, you see that a commuter train is stopped on the southbound rails crossing the road and is leaning over at a peculiar angle. Getting closer, you can see that the cars of the train are actually being held up by some large vehicles trapped up alongside them. Looking down the tracks to the south, you see that the rest of the cars in that direction have completely derailed and lie flopped over on their sides off the low embankment following the track. Looking back up the tracks in the opposite direction, you see four more cars behind the ones stopped across the road and that they are all still upright on the tracks.\n\n\nYou note a number of completely mangled cars and some dismembered body parts strewn amid the gridlock near the tracks and surmise that the train must have been trying to flee the city, when it ran through vehicles stopped on the tracks and derailed. Incidentally, you don\u2019t see any zombies wandering around in any of the train cars themselves, so you carefully make your way with the boy under one of the upright cars, dragging your gear with you, to get past the wreck.\n\n\nArriving on the other side of the train, you are surprised to see the gridlock on this side of the tracks is drastically reduced. Beyond a few more wrecked vehicles along the tracks themselves, you see that the streets are backed up only a few more blocks, before thinning out again. You should be able to get your car and maneuver through the occasional obstacle, until you\u2019re far enough from the city that gridlock and massive zombie hordes will no longer be a factor.\n\n\nYou take Jacob and make your way around the train station to the large commuter parking lot on the other side. Stopping behind some thick hedges against the red brick building, you look out into the parking lot. You see that most of the vehicles that were there, when you left that morning to go to work, are still there. It makes you wonder what became of them all. Has anyone else managed to escape the city of the dead? Or are you the only one.\n\n\nA number of zombies wander aimlessly around the parking lot, apparently deterred from leaving somehow, by the simple orange and white banded toll-arms dropped down across the exits. Even down, you should be able to drive right through those without any problem. You make a quick headcount and tally seventeen zombies in the lot; including a police officer zombie right next to your car. Even so, there are enough cars in the lot that you and the kid should be able to stealth your way to the car unseen. Even if the police officer or another zombie ends up blocking the car, you should be able to take it out quick enough to get yourself and the boy in the car and started before the rest can swarm you.\n\n\nRegardless, you look over the exit points in the lot a moment before heading out, to plan ahead a bit. You can see that once you are in your car, you\u2019ll need to take the north exit, where you can see a vehicle-free backstreet not too far away that you can take to bypass the two or three blocks of gridlock on the main road.\n\n\nThinking about the police officer zombie again, you wonder if it still has its sidearm. Damn, you sure could use a working firearm. It might actually be worth trying to take him out anyway, just to get his sidearm\u2026\n\n\nYou decide to:", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the time to stalk down the police officer zombie first, and then get to your car", "result": "You sneak into the parking lot with the boy.

The last thing you want is to be surprised by one inadvertently. Luckily, they just wander around in a predictable fashion and you can look under the cars to see their feet and legs when they are close.\n\n\nComing up behind the police zombie, you ready your weapon, and see that his holster is empty. Damn, it figures \u2013 he probably had it out defending himself when he got bit. He does have something black in his hand though, but as he turns enough for you to see what that is, you realize that he\u2019s holding a broken police radio rather than the gun.\n\n\nYou are about to head back the other way before he sees you, when he inexplicably starts to sniff the air loudly and then abruptly spins around to face you! Crap! When did the zombies start to have a sense of smell?!? The zombie lunges at you hungrily \u2013 attracting the attention of the others \u2013 but being ready, you slam it double-overhand in the face with your crowbar, and watch it slowly sink to the ground with a huge blood-squirting gash where its forehead used to be. As it goes down, you can\u2019t help but notice the officer\u2019s name on his uniform. \u201cOfficer Sol\u201d \u2013 How ironic.\n\n\nTurning, you begin to hurry back to your car with the rest of the zombies honing in on you, wailing and moaning loudly. You stop yourself though, reining in your natural instinct to panic, and force yourself to apply a bit of strategy to the situation. Making sure the zombies can see you, you run away from your car to the far side of the lot \u2013 drawing them all after you. When they\u2019ve sufficiently mobbed together, you run wide around them and back to your car.\n\n\nHopping in and locking the doors, you start the vehicle and pull out of your spot. With the zombies closing back in, you zoom through the lot, clipping a few and knocking them over, but not hitting hard enough to damage your car or kill them outright. Jacob looks up from the back seat \u2013 happy to see you \u2013 and puts his seatbelt on as you swerve and maneuver.

In fact, the farther south and west that you go, the more clear the roads become \u2013 as you leave the city behind and get into the suburbs proper.\n\n\nYou continue along, passing condos and housing developments, driving past a scattering of wandering zombies.

Your house is at the far end of a cul-de-sac off one of a dozen streets in an upscale community of well-tended lots. A large bed and breakfast on the right side of the road grabs your attention \u2013 it\u2019s burned to the ground and there are dozens of charred skeletons amid the ashes.

You slam on the brakes and stop, seeing dozens and dozens of them, but it\u2019s the thing towering over the crowd that really shakes you to the core \u2013 an eight or nine foot tall, exceedingly lanky, gray-skinned and naked giant of some kind that looks like it had once been a normal-sized human, but then stretched out like silly putty to its grotesquely elongated form. Its gaunt face is written with the look of unquenchable hunger, and it actually reaches out with a long gangly hand and snatches up a nearby zombie \u2013 yanking it off its feet to bite the top of its skull clean through in one chomp. The horrifying monster then slurps the zombie\u2019s brains out of its head and tosses the twitching body to the curb.\n\n\nIncredibly, none of the other zombies surrounding the thing even pay it any heed \u2013 the cannibal among them feasting with impunity at its own leisure!\n\n\nWith you having come around the curb and screeching the tires to a stop, the zombies and lanky giant among them, see you and start lumbering up the road toward the car. The road to your own home is not too far beyond them, so you could try to run through them, but that might draw them after you in that direction. You could also head back the way you came and take another road south four miles out of your way to drive around and come up from the other end of the road \u2013 which if you draw them off, will hopefully be free of them when you get back\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Drive through them", "result": "You decide to drive through the mob \u2013 flooring it and veering around them as much as possible.

Those zombies that close in on you are violently knocked aside by the car and you actually trundle over three or four of them in the process. The giant gaunt meanwhile, roars in rage as you pass by and reaches out to slam the backside of your car with a balled fist. You are shocked by the force of its blow \u2013 as the car abruptly fishtails away from the impact and nearly spins completely around. You don\u2019t waste any time turning the wheel back and stomp the accelerator; to donut-peel the car around again and zoom off, before the undead can crowd in around you.\n\n\nThe zombies and the cannibal among them wail angrily at you and give chase, but you quickly accelerate well ahead of them in the car.\n\n\n\u201cAre you trying to kill us?!?\u201d Abby yells, and then quickly puts her hand to her mouth to suppress a sudden bout of gagging.\n\n\nYou dismiss it of course, as there\u2019s really nothing you can say; and she\u2019s probably not as used to taking such risks as you are.\n\n\nArriving at the road that leads down to your own cul-de-sac, you note a few zombies wandering here and there, but nothing like the mob and giant abomination that you just escaped four or five blocks back.

At this point, you\u2019re only a few blocks from your house, but if you drive straight there, you\u2019ll have every zombie in the neighborhood heading that way as well\u2026\n\n\nYou do have a garage though, and it should still work on its own battery (even with the city power off). You could drive there quickly, get in and shut the garage; and then with the car off and out of sight, the zombies should wander off again eventually. Or you could drive down a parallel block, park on the curb and cut back through the backyards to your house. That way, the zombies would all crowd together on the wrong street and you could always sneak back to the car after they disperse later.\n\n\nAs you consider your options, you suddenly become aware of a dragging sound from the rear of the car. Looking in the rearview mirror once again, you spot the top of someone\u2019s head just popping up over the end of the trunk. Damn! A zombie must have grabbed hold of the back of your car when you got spun around and you\u2019ve been dragging it this whole way. That sort of complicates things a little\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Drive straight home and park the car in the garage. You can handle a single car-dragged zombie if it lasts that long", "result": "You decide to head directly to the house and drive down your lane to the end of the cul-de-sac. As you go, you note that all the front doors and first floor windows in the neighborhood appear to be smashed out and that there are an awful lot of bloody smears and dismembered body parts lying strewn across the road and sidewalks. Up ahead, you see your own home \u2013 and that it is no different. God, are you too late?!?\n\n\nWith a large number of zombies following the sound of the car into the area, you press your garage door opener and hope for the best. Thankfully, the batteries are fine and it begins to go up. You time it so that it will already be coming down when you drive under it and into the empty garage.\n\n\nPulling the car in and turning it off, you immediately leap out with weapon in hand and head around the vehicle to deal with the hanger-on. It\u2019s a zombie all right, but a middle-aged one and completely naked except for a speedo bathing suit. How the hell you missed him in the crowd you\u2019ll never know!\n\n\nThe guy really has no business wearing a speedo and certainly not as a zombie! You can\u2019t help but laugh when you see him \u2013 even though it snaps hungrily at you and tries to lunge forward. It falls flat on its face however, as being dragged behind the car has taken the feet and skin right off him below the knees. You stop laughing and do what must be done \u2013 splitting his skull wide with one solid blow.\n\n\nYou then slide the body out of the garage with your foot and wait (what seems like forever) for the garage door to come down all the way. You definitely want it to finish closing, before any of the other zombies get close enough to get under it and make it automatically go up again. You give a huge sigh of relief, as the last few inches of the gap disappear under the door and it seals itself tight.\n\n\nListening, you can hear the zombie hordes clamber into the streets outside, some scraping and bumping against the garage door in the press to discover where the car just went. Fortunately, they can\u2019t see you directly and are not actively trying to tear their way into the garage at the moment. Creeping to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek out and see at least a hundred or more walking dead crowding the end of the cul-de-sac. Great\u2026 how long is it going to take for them to get bored and wander off again?\n\n\nJacob then gets out of the car and comes over to join you. You put your finger to your lips to indicate that he needs to be quite, but he gives you a look as if the say \u201cduh.\u201d\n\n\nIt then suddenly occurs to you that Abby hasn\u2019t gotten out of the car yet. You go look through the passenger window and see her slumped unconscious in the seat with a mess of spit-up blood staining the front of her shirt. Oh shit, you think to yourself \u2013 here it comes\u2026\n\n\nShe seemed a little quiet as you were coming down the lane and must have finally succumbed to her bite as you were around the back of the car waiting for the garage door to come down. That means that she\u2019s going to zom-out on you at any moment. You send Jacob around to the other side of the car and then open Abby\u2019s door, shove the haft of your crowbar into her slack-open jaws and reach across to unbuckle her. And it\u2019s a good thing you do too, because her eyes \u2013 glazed over with the look of the dead \u2013 snap open abruptly; and she leans forward to snap at you with a vicious growl, but doesn\u2019t get anywhere with a mouth full of iron.\n\n\nYou then step back and violently yank her out of the car by the hair. As she falls to the ground and scrambles to get back up, you rip your weapon free of her teeth and finish her off with a number of solids cracks to the head. As blood starts to pool under her broken corpse, you sigh heavily and grab a painter\u2019s cloth off a shelf to cover the body.\n\n\nJacob comes around and stares at you with tears filling his eyes and looking at you like you just murdered his mother or something.\n\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d you say as gently as you can muster, \u201cshe got bit and held on as long as she could. Once you turn into a zombie, you\u2019ve already died and gone to heaven. It will be all right. She\u2019s in a better place now.\u201d\n\n\nJacob runs over and throws himself into your arms weeping quietly. You hug the kid and offer a moment of silence, but then stand up and focus on matters at hand.\n\n\nPutting the poor girl out of your mind and leading Jacob to the other side of the garage where he can\u2019t see the shroud-covered body, you take a mental inventory of the stuff in your garage and see that you have plenty of supplies to take with you and your family to get out of the suburbs and into more rural areas. Moving cautiously to the door leading into the house from the garage, you slowly turn the knob and crack the door just enough to peer through. You don\u2019t see anyone on the first floor, but the front door is broken open, the windows are busted out, and bloody tracks are everywhere. The place is a wreck and looks looted on top of it all \u2013 as you can see that all the cabinet doors in the kitchen are swung open and bare.\n\n\nYou think about your wife and wonder if she (or anyone) could possibly have survived all this. You want so badly to call out her name, but know that would be a very bad idea. You\u2019re going to have to be extra stealthy here, if you want to get the two of you out of this alive. (Not that driving your car into the garage with a huge mob of zombies in tow was the best way to start a stealth mission \u2013 but that\u2019s all water under the bridge now\u2026) You pull out the cell phone and check for a signal \u2013 nothing! You can\u2019t even call her to see if she\u2019s still in danger...\n\n\nAs you consider your options, it occurs to you that your neighbor on the garage-side of your house was an avid gun collector. Maybe he\u2019s still alive and barricaded in his house. Maybe you could try to sneak over there first and get a weapon and ammo from him. Maybe he knows what happened to your wife and family. Maybe your wife even tried to go over there during the initial outbreak. Quietly shutting the interior door and moving back to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek back out again and look over toward your neighbor\u2019s home. It doesn\u2019t look promising at all.\n\n\nLike the rest of the houses on the cul-de-sac, it too is broken open on the first floor, but you do see something different. As you look closer, you can see that his lawn is a sea of shot-up corpses and that there are signs of a breached barricading around his front door and windows. It looks like the old guy tried to make a stand but was eventually overrun. But where is he now? And if he was overrun and killed \u2013 then his weapons might still be in the house\u2026\n\n\nTaking Jacob by the shoulders, you quietly tell him that he needs to stay here safe in the garage and show him to a large space under a workbench for him to hide in. Your own daughters sometimes play house under there and a blanket and flashlight are still there from the last time. Jacob doesn\u2019t want to be left alone (especially with a dead zombie in here with him), but you explain that he\u2019ll be safe and that you\u2019ll come back for him when you find your wife; and then you\u2019ll all be able to leave together and go someplace even safer.\n\n\nJacob bravely complies, crawls in, and covers himself with the blanket, but then asks for a drink of water. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty!\u201d\n\n\nYou reach into your supplies and dig out a fresh bottle of water for the boy and hand it to him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be too long,\u201d you say and ready to head out.\n\n\nNow what?", "action_results": [null, {"action": "Check the basement for your wife", "result": "You head to your basement steps, take out a light, and then cautiously go down \u2013 weapon in hand.

Even so, you don\u2019t take any chances and shove the chisel-end of the crowbar down through its skull with a gruesome splishing sound.\n\n\nSatisfied that it isn\u2019t going to be getting back up to bite you anytime soon, you kick the body over to get a better look at it. It\u2019s a zombie alright, but it looks like it fell down the stairs or something and smashed it\u2019s head on the foundation at the bottom. You note the guy\u2019s jacket and realize that it was once your local pizza delivery guy. What a shame.\n\n\nChecking the rest of the basement, you don\u2019t find your wife. You do however, see that your seventy-two hour emergency kit and water is gone, but that all the camping stuff is still here. Your wife would have taken the gear if she had been able to leave.

Then looking, the three of you can see the zombie hordes clambering down the street toward you, but you are far enough ahead of them, that it is easy to slip between the houses and disappear from their view.\n\n\nQuickly heading through the backyards of the houses off the lane and then into the one of the backyards of the houses off your own lane, you are astonished to see an older woman in a nightgown standing in the yard with a zombie on a leash \u2013 like she was out walking a dog or something!\n\n\nThe woman, who is clearly a living person, is yelling at the tall, broad-shouldered, and slightly chubby zombie with a dog-lead around its neck.\n\n\n\u201cMove it Bo!\u201d she scolds, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there! You got to get some exercise if you want to get better!\u201d\n\n\nThe zombie meanwhile, just stands there dumbly, and moans like it doesn\u2019t feel up to the challenge. What\u2019s completely unbelievable about the whole thing, is that the zombie is actually being submissive and not trying to rip the old women to shreds.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d you yell as you approach \u2013 \u201cGet inside! There\u2019s a crowd of zombies coming!\u201d\n\n\nThe woman, initially surprised by your sudden appearance, then glares at you angrily and yells back, wagging her finger \u2013 \u201cYou were supposed to bring medicine for my son! Where is the medicine?!?\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 Clearly, the old woman has lost it. You try one more time to help, but don\u2019t stop hurrying across the yard. \u201cGo inside lady! Zombies are coming!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou dirty son of a bitch!\u201d the woman spits at you angrily \u2013 and you know there\u2019s no helping her. The zombie on the leash meanwhile, just moans curiously at the situation, and continues to stand there passively.\n\n\n\u201cWe got to get out of here now!\u201d Abby says, motioning back the way you just came.\n\n\nLooking back, you see dozens of zombies closing in toward you from around the houses on the lane where you parked the car. Shit \u2013 if they follow close enough to see you go into your house you\u2019re going to get swarmed. You make a quick adjustment to your plans and run with Abby and the boy from the crazy woman\u2019s yard to the end of the cul-de-sac and into the wooded area behind the houses. From here, the three of you can make your way around through the trees to your own back yard and then into your house through the rear.\n\n\nAs you flee the scene, the zombies come in and pull the old woman down \u2013 savaging her body with their horrible bloodstained teeth. She screams out in anguish once and then goes silent; while \u201cBo\u201d the zombie on a leash just stands there watching, completely ignored by the rest of the undead. For what it\u2019s worth, at least she distracted the ravenous horde from pursuing you momentarily.\n\n\nMoving closer to your house, you pass by your neighbor\u2019s house on the garage-side of your own home and suddenly remember that he was an avid gun collector. Maybe he\u2019s still alive and barricaded in his house. Maybe you could try to sneak over there first and get a weapon and ammo from him. Maybe he knows what happened to your wife and family.

First, his lawn is a sea of shot-up corpses all around the house; and second, there are signs of a breached barricading around his doors and windows. It looks like the old guy tried to make a stand but was eventually overrun. But where is he now? And if he was overrun and killed \u2013 then his weapons might still be in the house\u2026\n\n\nLooking toward your own home, you see that it too is broken open and that the back door off your deck is currently standing wide open.

Shit! What happened to her? You look back the way you came and can see her staggering slowly among the trees. She\u2019s looking around, but something is not right about the way she\u2019s doing so \u2013 it\u2019s not like a person looking for another person they just lost in the woods. Crouching low to keep out of sight, you observe her continuing to stager from tree to tree, almost falling over as she stumbles over the uneven ground. Her movements are jerky and erratic and sadly, you see that she has puked blood up all over the front of her shirt.\n\n\nShe moans balefully and you have no doubt that she has finally succumbed to her zombie bite.

You could drive there quickly, get in and shut the garage; and then with the car off and out of sight, the zombies should wander off again eventually. Or you could drive down a parallel block, park on the curb and cut back through the backyards to your house. That way, the zombies would all crowd together on the wrong street and you could always sneak back to the car after they disperse later.\n\n\nAs you consider your options, you suddenly become aware of a dragging sound from the rear of the car. Looking in the rearview mirror once again, you spot the top of someone\u2019s head just popping up over the end of the trunk. Damn!

You definitely want it to finish closing, before any of the other zombies get close enough to get under it and make it automatically go up again. You give a huge sigh of relief, as the last few inches of the gap disappear under the door and it seals itself tight.\n\n\nListening, you can hear the zombie hordes clamber into the streets outside, some scraping and bumping against the garage door in the press to discover where the car just went. Fortunately, they can\u2019t see you directly and are not actively trying to tear their way into the garage at the moment. Creeping to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek out and see at least a hundred or more walking dead crowding the end of the cul-de-sac. Great\u2026 how long is it going to take for them to get bored and wander off again?\n\n\nJacob then gets out of the car and comes over to join you.

Moving cautiously to the door leading into the house from the garage, you slowly turn the knob and crack the door just enough to peer through. You don\u2019t see anyone on the first floor, but the front door is broken open, the windows are busted out, and bloody tracks are everywhere. The place is a wreck and looks looted on top of it all \u2013 as you can see that all the cabinet doors in the kitchen are swung open and bare.\n\n\nYou think about your wife and wonder if she (or anyone) could possibly have survived all this. You want so badly to call out her name, but know that would be a very bad idea. You\u2019re going to have to be extra stealthy here, if you want to get the two of you out of this alive. (Not that driving your car into the garage with a huge mob of zombies in tow was the best way to start a stealth mission \u2013 but that\u2019s all water under the bridge now\u2026) You pull out the cell phone and check for a signal \u2013 nothing! You can\u2019t even call her to see if she\u2019s still in danger...\n\n\nAs you consider your options, it occurs to you that your neighbor on the garage-side of your house was an avid gun collector. Maybe he\u2019s still alive and barricaded in his house. Maybe you could try to sneak over there first and get a weapon and ammo from him. Maybe he knows what happened to your wife and family. Maybe your wife even tried to go over there during the initial outbreak. Quietly shutting the interior door and moving back to the small window in the side of the garage, you peek back out again and look over toward your neighbor\u2019s home. It doesn\u2019t look promising at all.\n\n\nLike the rest of the houses on the cul-de-sac, it too is broken open on the first floor, but you do see something different. As you look closer, you can see that his lawn is a sea of shot-up corpses and that there are signs of a breached barricading around his front door and windows.

You got to get some exercise if you want to get better!\u201d\n\n\nThe zombie meanwhile, just stands there dumbly, and moans like it doesn\u2019t feel up to the challenge.

From here, the two of you can make your way around through the trees to your own back yard and then into your house through the rear.\n\n\nAs you flee the scene, the zombies come in and pull the old woman down \u2013 savaging her body with their horrible bloodstained teeth. She screams out in anguish once and then goes silent; while \u201cBo\u201d the zombie on a leash just stands there watching, completely ignored by the rest of the undead. For what it\u2019s worth, at least she distracted the ravenous horde from pursuing you momentarily.\n\n\nMoving closer to your house, you pass by your neighbor\u2019s house on the garage-side of your own home and suddenly remember that he was an avid gun collector.

The pizza shop appears to have burnt down, taking half of the laundromat with it; while all the windows and doors have been smashed out of the dollar store and pharmacy.

Creeping down to the end of the alleyway, the two of you come to an eight foot high wooden fence blocking the way. Looking around, you don\u2019t see any zombies in the alley with you, so you take the time to move a large metal trashcan up against the fence to climb onto and get a look over the other side.\n\n\nStanding there on the trashcan, you can see that you are less than a hundred feet from the highway, with only a shallow drainage canal and short rise standing between you and the guardrails running along the highway above.

As you travel along, you keep an eye out for other drugstores or pharmacies, but don\u2019t see any. You do note however, that pretty much all of the small businesses you pass along the way, regardless of what they once sold, have been thoroughly ransacked and looted. It\u2019s not giving you any great confidence that you\u2019re going to be able to find the drugs you need to fight this infection.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so, you and Jacob near the railroad tracks and can actually see the train bridge rising up in the distance to the north of you, where it begins to cross the Indian River into the city. You move closer and arrive at the tracks to see that they are fenced-off from the residential areas on either side. Looking up and down their length, you see that they are clear of any zombies.\n\n\nHelping Jacob over the fence (a little more carefully this time) and then scaling it yourself, the two of you begin walking south down the railroad tracks, knowing that you\u2019re only four miles to your car. After a couple of minutes, you abruptly hear a large pack of dogs barking and snarling nearby. Looking, you see about two dozen dogs attacking a group of zombies in a parking lot, out in front of (coincidently) a large Veterinary Clinic not too far from you.\n\n\nAmazingly, the zombies don\u2019t seem to respond to the dogs \u2013 other than being drawn toward the commotion \u2013 while the dogs \u2018pack-tackle\u2019 and pull down individual zombies to devour them ravenously. There is something primeval about the dog pack; and you know that they\u2019re no longer your friendly neighborhood house pets. The threat of starvation has driven them back to the pack and now they easily hunt their slow-moving dull-witted zombie prey.\n\n\nThinking about the Veterinary Clinic, you wonder if anyone has thought to loot it yet. As an animal hospital, they would stock all sorts of drugs and medical supplies for the various animal surgeries. If you can figure out a way around both the zombies and \u2018man-eating\u2019 dog pack, you might be able to recover some truly valuable supplies \u2013 maybe even the antibiotics you need to beat your infection.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go over there,\u201d Jacob says nervously, \u201cyou might get bit by a dog\u201d\u2026\n\n\nYou decide to:", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Jacob here; go under the chain-link fence and circle wide around the parking lot to get into the front of veterinary clinic, while the dogs distract the zombies", "result": "You take out your tarp and instruct Jacob to hide here under it, while you go and search the veterinary clinic. You know that he\u2019ll be safer, hidden on the tracks behind the fencing on either side, than creeping past a zombie horde and killer dogs with you.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not happy about the idea at all, but complies.\n\n\nYou move to one of the posts in the chain-link fence and pop the lowest sets of wire clips off. With nothing holding the bottom half of the fence to the post, you are able to push your way under the fence and then set the bottom of the fence back so it still looks secure.\n\n\nYou then carefully make your way around the perimeter of the large parking lot, ducking behind cars and creeping low, until you have made it all the way to the front of the veterinary clinic. As you go, the dogs continue to distract the zombies. You wonder for a moment which you fear more \u2013 the zombies or the dogs. Probably still the zombies, as the dogs would only be interested in attacking the weakest prey, rather than one that would fight back. You hope however, that you don\u2019t run into a wild dog pack when there are no zombies around for them to choose over you\u2026\n\n\nChecking the front door to the clinic, you find that it is locked. Damn, that\u2019s a pain in the ass \u2013 but a good sign it hasn\u2019t been looted yet. You note that the \u2018dog and zombie show\u2019 in the parking lot is still making a lot of noise, so breaking the glass out of the front door doesn\u2019t seem like too great a risk. You jab the glass quickly with the pointiest end of your weapon and watch it shatter completely into thousands of small uniform pieces.\n\n\nThe ruckus in the parking lot does not stop, but a mid-sized dog with red-stained paws and jowls does suddenly come over from the pack to investigate the sound. It sees you, but when you wave your weapon at it menacingly, it turns around quickly to go back to its pack.\n\n\nSlipping in through the busted out door, you enter a small foyer with a coatrack and another glass door leading into the veterinary clinic waiting room. The inner door is unlocked and you\u2019re glad to have at least one closed door between you and the zombies, should the dogs move on and leave the zombie hoard to its own once again.\n\n\nGoing in the clinic and looking around, you see that the foyer enters into a large waiting room, with a counter to one side, a wall of various animal feed and toys on the other side, and a row of waiting chairs in between. A single closed door exits the waiting area, heading deeper into the building.\n\n\nDriven by hunger and a little curiosity, you go over to the feed section and look at some of the items on display. There are sacks and cans of food for various kinds of animals. You note some tins of 100% natural dog foods. Hmm, beef and chicken with vegetables\u2026 precooked and ready to serve\u2026 Shit, the dogs aren\u2019t going to need it\u2026 You load up on as many tins as you can comfortably carry with the rest of your gear.\n\n\nHeading over to the door exiting the waiting room, you give a listen and don\u2019t hear anything on the other side. Opening it reveals a hallway heading past two surgical suites, a supply room, and a pet washing station, to a cage and pen area at the far rear of the building. Moving in, you check out each area as you go along. In the surgical suites you find a variety of useful medical supplies, including bandages, gauze, wraps and tape, medical tools, suture kits, scissors, scalpels, syringes, antiseptic, saline IV bags, and sterile water. You grab a bottle of sterile water and drink it down. It certainly tastes \u2018sterile\u2019 all right, but at least it\u2019s refreshing. You find a large medical bag as well and fill it with as much as you can manage.\n\n\nMoving down to the supply area, you find all sorts of stuff, mostly unopened packs of what you just found in the surgical suites, but also more animal feed, some administrative items, and two large locked drug cabinets; one of which is also some sort of refrigeration unit \u2013 though it has been without power for some time now.

Immediately you know something is wrong. Amid the usual smells of caged animals that you would expect to have, you also smell the salty stink of slaughter and the sickening stench of decomposition.\n\n\nYou put your fingers to your lips and motion for Jacob to hold back quietly, while you check things out ahead.\n\n\nListening, you can hear something breathing heavily around the corner. Whatever it is, it doesn\u2019t sound like a zombie \u2013 they don\u2019t breath right? \u2013 Nor does it sound like a dog or other animal you\u2019d expect in a clinic. The breathing is larger and deeper \u2013 like a bear or mountain lion\u2026\n\n\nVery quietly, you peek around the corner and see a number of smashed and ripped-open pens and cages scattered all over the place. Bones and tufts of fur are all that remain of whatever animals were once in them. Along the outer wall of the building is a long row of dog kennels with door flaps leading to fenced runs outside the building itself. All of the bars to the kennels are bent or completely broken open; and bloody splashes on the walls and floor within, indicate the fate of the once occupants. The farthest kennel on the right however, while ripped open, shows no signs of blood. Perhaps that is because it is for a smaller dog type, and the door flap leading out is only a foot high and a few inches wide. The occupant, if there was one, either escaped out the flap \u2013 or was swallowed whole \u2013 by whatever caused so much carnage here in the clinic.\n\n\nYou look toward the sound of heavy breathing and wait for your eyes to adjust to the shadows. Lying in the far corner of the area, amid almost a nest-like pile of twisted cage fragments is a huge crimson abomination of some sort. It looks like a giant-sized canine \u2013 only now completely warped and hairless, with thick red skin, banded over rippling and wholly unnatural musculature. Huge bone spikes protrude from the thing\u2019s neck and shoulders, while long black talons sprout from its over-sized paws \u2013 each as wide as a human head. The beast really is as large as a bear and is currently sleeping. Even sleeping, it looks incredibly dangerous.\n\n\nYou freeze where you are a moment, waiting for your heartbeat to come back down to a reasonable rate. The fact that the monster is sleeping, leads you to believe that it is a living creature, rather than undead. That probably means that it can be killed. Still, what the hell caused it mutate into what slumbers before you? It makes you wonder what other monsters besides zombies have been released upon the world in this damn apocalypse.\n\n\nYou test the grip on your weapon and wonder if a well-placed blow to the base of its skull would finish it off. Given that it is sleeping might mean you could actually creep up to it for a try. But damn if you want that thing awake and on you \u2013 it would rip you limb from limb.\n\n\nWith it in here however, there\u2019s no way you can get into the drug cabinets \u2013 and who\u2019s to say the thing won\u2019t try to track you and the boy or something when it wakes up.\n\n\nGiven this, you:", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to sneak up and do it in while it sleeps", "result": "You take a deep breath, hold it, and very carefully tiptoe over to where the giant monster is sleeping.

It just lays there breathing heavily.\n\n\nYou note a placard on a section of broken cage that it currently rests on. The placard reads: \u2018Rabies Quarantine\u2019. You wonder if this creature was a rabid dog and the rabies virus somehow mutated with the zombie virus to create this abomination.\n\n\nRaising your crowbar high over your head, you hesitate a moment \u2013 not wanting to get this wrong. You have to kill it in one blow, while you have the chance. You note that the huge bone spines protruding from the thing\u2019s neck actually come right out of the vertebrae and through its thick leathery skin. You can see right where you need to strike, in order to slam your crowbar down on its spinal column to paralyze it \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be a tricky shot to get the blow down between the protective spines.\n\n\nLooking at the thing\u2019s head, you see that it\u2019s not protected by any spines, but is incredibly thick and boney-looking.

With no time to worry about it now, you focus on the beast itself \u2013 and smash the back of its neck a second time \u2013 just as it opens its snapping fang-crowded jaws to lunge for your throat!\n\n\nThe force of the blow sends a shockwave through the monster\u2019s massive body and it abruptly slumps forward, twitching and wheezing loudly.

Struggling to remove your jacket and shirt, you see a five inch long gash across the right side of your belly/waist. A small knot of intestine pokes out through the hole. You wash the area and take a moment to look through the intestine for holes. Thankfully, the intestines appear intact, so you carefully tuck them back in through the gash.\n\n\nGrimacing with each jab of the small curved needle, you begin to sew the wound closed as best as you can, but only manage to get about half of it done before blacking out from the pain and blood loss. You lay there swimming in and out of semi-consciousness for a while until finally, you find yourself standing over your own body in some sort of bizarre out of body experience. Looking down, you see a large pool of your own blood and realize that you must have bled out. With all your other injuries, your body just couldn\u2019t recover from the addition of yet another grievous wound.\n\n\nLooking across the room, you see the boy Jacob, still waiting quietly in the chair.

The Spaniard meanwhile, doesn\u2019t look touched yet; and is actually doing an impressive job keeping the zombies at bay with lightning-fast kicks that continually knock them back or topple them over. You wonder how long he can keep up such a blistering pace though.\n\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that the zombie mob is actually between you and the two men, you\u2019d think about trying to get their attention somehow.

Looking through your drugs and find some novocain syringes and morphine drops meant to be administered orally. You set them aside and grab some sterile water, betadyne, surgical gloves, and sutures. Removing your jacket and shirt, you clean the slash across your torso and give the edges a couple of shots of novocain.\n\n\nGrimacing with each jab of the small curved needle, you sew the wound closed as best as you can and then wrap the hell out of it with gauze and medical tape. You then take another pack of morphine squirt it into some sterile water and swallow it down.\n\n\nAfter laying there for twenty minutes or so, you feel OK enough to resume your travels. If this wound and/or infection is going to kill you, you\u2019d rather have at least a chance to see your family one last time, rather than just staying here to die alone. As you get up to leave, you find a large medical bag and fill it with as much sterile water and medical supplies as you can manage.\n\n\nYou then move to the supply area and find all sorts of stuff, mostly unopened packs of medical supplies that you found stocked in the surgical suites; but there is also some animal feed, administrative items, and the two large locked drug cabinets. You easily pry open the drug cabinets and find the cabinets stocked with a variety of antibiotics, vermicides, and pain killers (like novocain syringes and morphine in little needle-free syringes, meant to be administered orally). You know they\u2019re made for animals, but they got to be better than nothing (or so you hope). Finding an antibiotic with a familiar sounding name, you see a dose-by-weight chart and quickly determine how much you\u2019ll need to fight your infection. Hoping for the best, you take the first dose.\n\n\nThen looking across to the pet washing station, you see that it is open and empty with nothing in it to warrant any sort of in-depth search. Going to the door at the top end of the hallway, you once again listen, but don\u2019t hear anything. Cautiously opening the door, you see a large waiting room with a counter to one side, a wall of various animal feed and toys on the other side, and a row of waiting chairs in between. A single glass door exits the waiting area, to a small foyer with a coatrack and large glass doors leading out of the building itself. Through the large windows in the outside wall of the waiting room, you can see the zombies milling around the parking lot. Apparently, the dog pack has moved on and the zombie horde has begun to wander about again.\n\n\nDriven by hunger and a little curiosity, you crouch low and go over to the feed section to look at some of the items on display. There are sacks and cans of food for various kinds of animals. You note some tins of 100% natural dog foods. Hmm, beef and chicken with vegetables\u2026 precooked and ready to serve\u2026 Shit, the dogs aren\u2019t going to need it\u2026 You load up on as many tins as you can comfortably carry with the rest of your gear.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "You head out of the clinic and back into the alleyway behind it.

You hear something stumbling around inside and wheezing oddly, unaware of your presence.\n\n\nStraining to adjust your eyes to the darkness you see that the back of the pharmacy is a ransacked mess, just like the dollar store was. The place is torn apart and nothing of use has been left behind. You see a short hallway passing between two offices and a restroom that ends at a swinging door. Beyond the swinging door would be the counter of the pharmacy and the storefront itself.\n\n\nIt sounds like the zombie you heard is in the office off the hallway to the right. Being so dark back here in the hallway, you decide to get a light out, not worried about drawing the zombie to you \u2013 as you intend to engage it anyway. You position yourself up against the wall just outside of the right office, ready to ambush it when it comes out, and flick on your light. That\u2019s when you see black sooty smudges all over the walls of the hallway and more of the charred footprints on the floor. In fact, the floor itself looks strange, and you realize that all the tiles have all been melted and scorched as if by spilled acid.\n\n\nYou are suddenly having second thoughts about your plan, when the zombie in the office comes hurtling out after the light playing on the wall across the hall from you. As you had hoped, it doesn\u2019t even notice you as it comes through the door. You are shaken however, seeing that the zombie is completely blackened and charred, just like the carbonized skeletons you saw in the helicopter crash. Somehow, the thing is not only still alive, but moving around with surprising agility \u2013 even for a zombie!\n\n\nYou force yourself not to think about it and swing the crowbar down on the back of the thing\u2019s head with one hand, while holding the flashlight in the other. The heavy shaft of your weapon clanks loudly off the creature\u2019s burnt skull \u2013 as if you were striking stone \u2013 sending an explosion of black soot into the air and rocking the vile thing forward. It doesn\u2019t drop however, and whips around to face you.\n\n\nFlame broiled aside, something is wrong with the zombie\u2019s jaw. It hangs open way too far (as if dislocated) \u2013 and five foot strands of heavy black drool hang from its slavering mouth. The drool swings around as the monster spins and slaps you right across the face and eyes.\n\n\nYou feel a sudden burning sensation on your face and your vision instantly tears over. You realize that the drool is highly acidic and is scorching deep burn-lines where it has splashed across your exposed skin. A moment later and you are completely blind!\n\n\nYou feel the creature grab you with both hands and pull you toward its gaping mouth. In panic you start wailing away with the crowbar \u2013 even as each strike seems to cover you in more of the acidic slobber. The monster gurgles angrily, frothing and foaming at the mouth, but your onslaught finally wears it down; and you manage to finish it off with a few more blind swings of the crowbar.\n\n\nAs the acid sizzles deeper into your face and now into your skin under your clothing, you rush over to the bathroom, feeling your way along the wall. Inside you find the toilet \u2013 with a tank, thank god \u2013 and tear off the tank lid to splash cooling water into your face. You then rip off your clothes and start grabbing handfuls of paper-towels from the restroom dispenser to rub at the burns covering your body as well.\n\n\nOnce the fiery pain has been dulled to a warm sting, you soak your clothes in water and then wring them out, before putting them back on again. Stumbling back to the rear door of the pharmacy, you lean out and whisper loudly for Jacob to come to you. You hear him hurrying over from where he was hidden \u2013 and then gasp in shock as he sees you.\n\n\nHe actually begins crying, perhaps thinking you are going to die or something. Maybe he\u2019s right\u2026\n\n\n\u201cMr. Greg! Are\u2026 Are you dying?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot just yet,\u201d you reply, hoping that\u2019s true. \u201cCome inside to the restroom with me.

You enter with the boy and secure yourselves in to wait and see if your vision comes back\u2026\n\n\nAfter sitting there resting for at least an hour, your vision is still toast. It looks like you may have been blinded permanently by the acid. Even if it\u2019s not permanent, it could take days, weeks, or even months for your vision to return. Jacob looks at the damage and informs you that one of your eyes is \u201call gross and melted,\u201d and the other is covered in \u201cwhite stuff.\u201d That cannot be good. Your heart sinks.

With a heavy sense of loss, you put the noose around your neck and step off the sink \u2013 into a dark pool of swirling numbness.\n\n\nA moment later, you find yourself standing in some sort of bizarre out of body experience, looking up at your limp body hanging from the rope. Standing in the far corner of the restroom is that strange shadowy black specter from your unconscious subway dreams. It regards you with unknown intent and you wonder what it is and what it wants with you \u2013 but that is another story\u2026\n\n\nEND", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hold out for as long as you can here in the restroom, to see if your sight will return", "result": "You and Jacob settle in to wait for your eyesight to return, bandaging your eyes as best you can to keep them clean.

That and you\u2019d be half likely to get seen by the zombie horde near the underpass and eaten alive.\n\n\nStill, you might be able to send the boy in to see what he can find. The problem would be convincing him to leave your side. And it certainly would be a difficult sell, as he\u2019s pretty scared to begin with. Of course, he would probably help you search, if you went in with him.\n\n\nYou\u2019re sure that there are no zombies in the front of the pharmacy, as they would have heard your fight with the drooler and come by now.

You tell him to wait in the restroom a moment, while you feel your way over to shove the body of the charred drooler into the office off the hall with your foot. Closing the office door, you call for Jacob to come join you and a moment later feel his clinging grasp at your side.\n\n\nMaking your way to the swinging door at the end of the hallway, you crouch low and listen again \u2013 this time with real unease. What if there is something else in there, waiting to ambush you? Still, without much of a choice, you steel your nerves and quietly push the door open enough ask Jacob what he sees.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a giant mess in there,\u201d he says, \u201cwith lots of shelves and some coat hanger things and lots of plastic bags and a tall counter that I can\u2019t see over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d you say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t see over the counter, then it\u2019s safe for us to go in there.

After a good fifteen minutes scraping around through everything on the floor, you have found nothing and Jacob has gathered a small number of scattered pills. Seven of them to be exact; and not one the same as any of the others. Even with Jacob describing each pill to you by color, shape, size, and whether it has any writing on it, you only recognize one pill: an eight hundred milligram Ibuprofen.\n\n\nShit, that was a waste. Even if you were holding an antibiotic in your hand, just one or two pills won\u2019t make any difference. You call Jacob closer.\n\n\n\u201cIs there something you can get up onto to get a look out over the counter,\u201d you ask the boy.\n\n\n\u201cThere are some chairs on wheels he says, and a door with a window in it,\u201d he replies.\n\n\n\u201cGo to the door and look out,\u201d you instruct Jacob, \u201cthen tell me what you see.\n\n\nThe boy walks over to the door and looks through.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empty,\u201d he reports back, \u201cOoh!

No point in going out there and risk getting seen then.\n\n\n\u201cOK, you did good; Lets go,\u201d you reply, feeling your way back to the swinging door again.\n\n\nArriving back in the restroom, you once again secure yourself in and wait to see if your sight is going to come back anytime soon.\n\n\nYou wait a full day, sitting there with Jacob and trying to stay hydrated on your water\u2013 each of you with your own supply. Just before laying down to sleep, you take the bandages off and strain to see \u2013 but get nothing; except that you can distinguish light and dark in your left eye. That\u2019s not looking too good for your right though.

Maybe he wants you to check your eyes.\n\n\nRemoving the bandages, you still can\u2019t see. Without thinking, you poke your finger into your right eye to feel for the damage. A hollow socket meets your finger, except for some slimy melted goo oozing around in the bottom of it. Your stomach lurches at the sensation and you throw up once more. Jacob is saying something again, but you can\u2019t hear him. His voice is just too far away.\n\n\nA little more delicately now, you close your left eye and touch the lid, feeling an intact eyeball on the other side. Something about that makes you giddy and you begin to laugh hysterically for nearly ten minutes.\n\n\nThen suddenly you hear someone knocking at the living room door. You stand up wobbly to go answer it, stopping a moment to wonder where you are. Was it the bathroom or the front hall? You\u2019re not sure. Better check your fly just in case.

Your head spins with the sudden movement and you\u2019re pretty sure that you\u2019re about to black out.\n\n\nA moment later, you find yourself standing in some sort of bizarre out of body experience, watching a mob of ravening zombies ripping the entrails from your body and passing them around the hallway outside of the pharmacy\u2019s restroom \u2013 as others overwhelm the boy Jacob within and tear him to pieces. Damn, they must have been attracted to the ten minutes of hysterical laughing, caused by delirium brought on from your blood infection.\n\n\nThen looking out toward the rear door of the building, you see that strange shadowy black specter from your unconscious subway dreams lurking nearby.

You start to get up, but the woman gently motions for you to stay in bed for the moment.\n\n\n\u201cGlad to see that you are awake,\u201d she says, \u201cbut let me check your bandages before you get moving around too much.\u201d\n\n\nThe old man meanwhile, just gives a grunt to acknowledge you, and the heads off into the house somewhere to attend to other things. The old woman unwraps a few bandages to change them. As she does, you notice that they each cover sooty-black poultices over your wounds and that any sign of your sepsis infection is completely gone.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the heck is that stuff?\u201d you ask the woman.\n\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she replies with a smile, \u201cbut this poultice has drawn out all of the poison. You\u2019re quite lucky, because we had no antibiotics to help out.\u201d\n\n\nShe then hands you a glass of water. Damn, your vision is blurry and your depth perception is completely shot. The woman actually has to take hold of your hand and guide it to the glass.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still a bit jaundice though,\u201d the woman continues as you drink from the glass, \u201cI hate to have to tell you this if you don\u2019t already know, but it looks like you have hepatitis. Please make sure you don\u2019t share your water or food with anyone; and no kissing. At least not until you can be checked out properly by a doctor \u2013 not that we have any who\u2019ll be making house calls anytime soon.\u201d She winks at this last comment.\n\n\n\u201cMy eyes?\u201d you ask, motioning to the bandage covering your right eye.\n\n\nThe woman gives you a look of empathy, \u201cYour right eye is gone son,\u201d she tries to say gently, \u201cbut you still have your left eye and I think it\u2019s healing nicely. You have some clouding in it, but an optometrist may be able to help you further, once one becomes available that is. I\u2019m afraid that might take some time though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d you ask, beginning to wonder about your capacity to resume your journey.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky the boy was able to get help from our daughter Laura when you came over the wall. She was able to kill the zombies trying to get at you with her crossbow, and brought you and the boy up to the house.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Laura is really nice,\u201d Jacob adds to the conversation.\n\n\nThe old woman smiles patiently at the boy, then continues: \u201cYou were unconscious for two days, then in and out of it for another three days, so I guess that\u2019s five days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFive days,\u201d you say out loud with a sense of urgency, \u201cI have to get on my way as soon as possible!\u201d\n\n\nThe woman gives you a sudden look that is full of pity; like she is about to have to tell you something you really don\u2019t want to hear.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you say; \u201ctrust me, I\u2019ve been through the wringer lately, I can\u2019t imagine it can get much worse.\u201d\n\n\nBoy does she prove you wrong.\n\n\nThe woman gently touches your left knee through the comforter, then runs her hand a little further down \u2013 to where the comforter abruptly drops out from under her touch. It takes a moment for you to comprehend\u2026\n\n\nYour leg is gone, just below your knee.\n\n\nWhat the hell happened to you?!? You find yourself involuntarily covering your face in your hands and sobbing.\n\n\n\u201cIt will be alright Mr. Greg,\u201d you hear Jacob say, but the old woman takes him out of the room, telling him that you need a bit of time alone to let it all settle in.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nYou come to learn that a group of zombies had seen you and Jacob climbing over the cemetery wall and came over to try to get at you. You passed out just after clearing the wall and Jacob had to run to the house to get help before the zombies got over the wall to get at your unconscious body. Luckily, the old couple\u2019s twenty-something daughter Laura was on watch in the trees out in front of the house when Jacob came up from the wall. She came back to you with him and shot all the zombies dead with her crossbow. Unfortunately, one of the zombies managed to flop over the wall and take some bites out of your left calve before she could shoot it.\n\n\nShe was about to shoot you in the head too, but Jacob\u2019s pleading managed to sway her. Instead of killing you, she applied a tourniquet to your leg and dragged you up to the house. After some discussion with her parents and more pleading on the part of Jacob, the old man decided to tie you to a tree and saw your leg off to see if that stopped the zombie virus from claiming you.\n\n\nWhen two hours had passed and you had still not changes into a zombie, they all figured they had stopped the virus before it had reached the rest of your body. You were then brought inside and treated by the family for the sepsis infection.\n\n\nAlong with losing your leg, you have also lost any hope of making it home to save your family. You slowly come to accept this cruel fate and after another week, have made yourself a useful addition to the group. The old man gives you a pair of crutches to move around on and you are able to stand watches with the family to keep the zombies out of the graveyard.\n\n\nWith everyone getting into a daily routine and keeping themselves so busy, time seems to drift together into one incomprehensible span. The next thing you know, forty days has passed, and you find yourself out front of the house with everyone, cheering the arrival of army tanks now rolling through the suburbs.\n\n\nThere are no zombies on the streets to threaten them now; only their scattered bones remain and roving bands of feral dogs that decimated the ranks of the undead once they started to fall over after a month of prolonged decomp.\n\n\nFire has burned down large portions of the city on the other side of the river to the north; and probably would have claimed the entire city, had not a couple of days of rain helped to put most of it out. The zombies meanwhile, really seemed to go downhill after the rain. All the flies and horrific smell of it afterwards was almost unbearable.\n\n\nYou find out from the army, that the zombie outbreak has mostly been contained and a semblance of civilization is starting to be repaired in many places. It seems that the zombies only last about a month before decomposition and natural predation \u2013 mostly by huge packs homeless dogs \u2013 finally do them in. Right now, there are a few \u2018newer\u2019 zombies still out there, but the survivors are so spread out and prepared, that in another month or so, they\u2019ll finally all be gone.\n\n\nMany of the major cities all suffered simultaneous outbreaks. It appears that a Chinese Terrorist Group, known as \u201cXi Lung\u201d or \u2018Death of Grave Dragons\u2019 was behind the zombie gas attacks that initially caused the epidemic. All part of a revenge scheme for the capture of their leader earlier this year in San Diego California.\n\n\nA lot of talk is going around however, that the Terrorist Group had to have been funded by the Chinese Government; and that the whole thing was really just a preemptive strike by China to soften everyone up for an invasion. Great, just what everyone needs after surviving the zombie apocalypse\u2026\n\n\nAfter another week or so, the city and surrounding areas have all been secured; and everyone is finally allowed to re-inhabit the area. Some army medics fit you with a prosthetic leg and after getting used to it, you bid Jacob, the old man, and his family farewell, to make the journey back to your own home. You are glad to see that Jacob has come to love the old man\u2019s family as his own and they are happy to have him stay with them.\n\n\nYou slowly make your way back through the suburbs, stopping at the commuter lot where you left your car that fateful morning you boarded the subway train to head into the city. Amazingly it\u2019s still there and untouched. You get in and drive down the now cleared roads and a few military checkpoints to your home.\n\n\nGoing in, you find the place empty of anyone living. You note a large mass-gravesite down the road and head over to find that almost all of the dead have been cleaned up already and buried in deep unmarked graves. A list of identified bodies is available and with sad eyes, you read through and find the name of your wife among the dead. Surprisingly, you also find your own name right beside hers. Apparently the body of an unidentified man was found with her in the home and was presumed to be you.\n\n\nNot seeing the names of your two daughters, you travel toward their school and find even more of the mass gravesites. Sadly, you find their names among those who died after about two weeks being holed-up in the school complex. It tears your heart out! You could have saved them, if only you hadn\u2019t suffered that stupid infection and got blinded trying to find meds!\n\n\nYou have survived the zombie apocalypse, but the price was very high indeed\u2026\n\n\nTHE END", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Risk searching through the pharmacy for meads before leaving", "result": "\u201cJacob,\u201d you say, getting up and feeling for the door, \u201cwe need to see if we can find some medicine in the front of the store.

You tell him to wait in the restroom a moment, while you feel your way over to shove the body of the charred drooler into the office off the hall with your foot. Closing the office door, you call for Jacob to come join you and a moment later feel his clinging grasp at your side.\n\n\nMaking your way to the swinging door at the end of the hallway, you crouch low and listen again \u2013 this time with real unease. What if there is something else in there, waiting to ambush you? Still, without much of a choice, you steel your nerves and quietly push the door open enough ask Jacob what he sees.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a giant mess in there,\u201d he says, \u201cwith lots of shelves and some coat hanger things and lots of plastic bags and a tall counter that I can\u2019t see over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d you say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t see over the counter, then it\u2019s safe for us to go in there.

After a good fifteen minutes scraping around through everything on the floor, you have found nothing and Jacob has gathered a small number of scattered pills. Seven of them to be exact; and not one the same as any of the others. Even with Jacob describing each pill to you by color, shape, size, and whether it has any writing on it, you only recognize one pill: an eight hundred milligram Ibuprofen.\n\n\nShit, that was a waste. Even if you were holding an antibiotic in your hand, just one or two pills won\u2019t make any difference. You call Jacob closer.\n\n\n\u201cIs there something you can get up onto to get a look out over the counter,\u201d you ask the boy.\n\n\n\u201cThere are some chairs on wheels he says, and a door with a window in it,\u201d he replies.\n\n\n\u201cGo to the door and look out,\u201d you instruct Jacob, \u201cthen tell me what you see.\n\n\nThe boy walks over to the door and looks through.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empty,\u201d he reports back, \u201cOoh!

And remember that I can\u2019t see, so you have to tell me which direction. Let\u2019s do that, by having you take my hand and pointing it. That way I\u2019ll know exactly which direction everything is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we should go back inside and practice it all a few times first,\u201d you add, wanting to make sure you and the boy have it all hashed out before having to use it while being chased by a ravening horde of flesh eating zombies.\n\n\nGoing back inside the rear of the pharmacy, the two of you manage to work out a pretty decent mode of communicating what Jacob sees, so it will be useful information to you. With that settled you and the boy creep out of the pharmacy and head back up the alleyways to the east.\n\n\nThe journey back to the cemetery is incredibly nerve-racking and seems to take forever. You and Jacob creep slowly through back alleys and side streets, even going blocks out of your way to avoid small groups of zombies wandering about. As you don\u2019t entirely trust Jacob\u2019s sense of direction, you keep a mental map of where you are in your head at all times. It is unbelievably taxing, and your head is pounding like crazy when you finally throw yourself over the five foot high stone wall on the west side of the cemetery.\n\n\n\u201cWe made it!\u201d you laugh to yourself; head swimming and body completely exhausted from the effort.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Greg!

Moving south with Jacob a few blocks and into an alleyway behind the buildings off the street, the two of you creep closer to the highway, until the alley comes to a dead end at an eight foot high wooden fence blocking the way. Looking around, you don\u2019t see any zombies in the alley with you, so you take the time to move a large metal trashcan up against the fence to climb onto and get a look over the other side.\n\n\nStanding there on the trashcan, you can see that you are less than a hundred feet from the highway, with only a shallow drainage canal and short rise standing between you and the guardrails running along the highway above. Looking north and south, you see that there are no zombies in the space here between the city blocks and the highway itself, although you can see the mob of them still to the north, clustered at the bottom of the highway onramps. If you move carefully, you should be able to get up onto the highway unseen.\n\n\nAs you are standing there, you hear a sudden moan and look behind you to see six zombies wandering into the end of the alley with you.

He\u2019s banged up a bit from the fall, but will be OK.\n\n\nThe zombies on the other side of the fence begin to howl angrily and scrabble at the fence trying to get through. Fortunately, the fence is hefty enough to keep them contained and you are far enough away from the mob of zombies at the underpass that they can\u2019t hear the commotion over their own moaning din.\n\n\nKeeping low, you and Jacob make your way across the shallow drainage canal and up the short rise to the highway. Jumping over the guardrails, the two of you move low through the vehicles left bumper-to-bumper on what has now become and endless parking lot in each direction.

As you travel along, you keep an eye out for other drugstores or pharmacies, but don\u2019t see any. You do note however, that pretty much all of the small businesses you pass along the way, regardless of what they once sold, have been thoroughly ransacked and looted. It\u2019s not giving you any great confidence that you\u2019re going to be able to find the drugs you need to fight this infection.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so, you and Jacob near the railroad tracks and can actually see the train bridge rising up in the distance to the north of you, where it begins to cross the Indian River into the city. You move closer and arrive at the tracks to see that they are fenced-off from the residential areas on either side. Looking up and down their length, you see that they are clear of any zombies.\n\n\nHelping Jacob over the fence (a little more carefully this time) and then scaling it yourself, the two of you begin walking south down the railroad tracks, knowing that you\u2019re only four miles to your car. After a couple of minutes, you abruptly hear a large pack of dogs barking and snarling nearby. Looking, you see about two dozen dogs attacking a group of zombies in a parking lot, out in front of (coincidently) a large Veterinary Clinic not too far from you.\n\n\nAmazingly, the zombies don\u2019t seem to respond to the dogs \u2013 other than being drawn toward the commotion \u2013 while the dogs \u2018pack-tackle\u2019 and pull down individual zombies to devour them ravenously. There is something primeval about the dog pack; and you know that they\u2019re no longer your friendly neighborhood house pets. The threat of starvation has driven them back to the pack and now they easily hunt their slow-moving dull-witted zombie prey.\n\n\nThinking about the Veterinary Clinic, you wonder if anyone has thought to loot it yet. As an animal hospital, they would stock all sorts of drugs and medical supplies for the various animal surgeries.

There are easily a couple hundred of them and it would help explain where all the victims from the townhouses went. Still, it forces you and Jacob to head west a little sooner than you wanted, but in doing so, you see that there are backstreets that go down between each block, where each townhouse has its own fenced-in backyard and a private garage or two.\n\n\nLooking down one of the backstreets, you happen to spot a man coming out from one of the fenced-in yards, carrying a white propane tank under each arm. He takes a moment to gaze up at the surrounding rooftops and then cautiously heads over to a large shopping cart loaded up with well over a dozen more of the propane cylinders \u2013 and what looks like a coil of razor-wire.\n\n\nJacob points the man out and is about to say something, but you quietly shush him and motion for him to wait a moment first.\n\n\nObserving the man a little longer, you see him add the two cylinders to his collection and then look up at the rooftops once again.

This particular one is wrapped in razor-wire with a road flare ducktaped to it just under the gas release valve.

She stares ominously at you, the boy, and the crazy man for a moment, then wails loudly and begins to leap across the rooftops in great bounds towards the three of you. Damn!\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running this time you dirty whore!\u201d the mad man yells, pulling the tab on the flare and popping the valve off the propane cylinder.

With the water level in the tunnel at least three feet deep, and no ledges or other way to stay out of it, you know that traveling the sewers on this side of the river will be impossible.\n\n\nLeaving the manhole cover open, you and the boy continue on, ducking down here and there along the way to keep out of sight of the scattered mobs of zombies lurking about. You note that the farther west you go, the more crowded the streets are getting with both zombies and abandoned cars. Pretty soon, you are back into gridlocked city streets teaming with wandering dead and realize that you must be close to the highway.\n\n\nSure enough, looking a few blocks further ahead, you can make out the highway overpass itself and the vehicle-choked onramps that lead up to it from the main street. You note that a massive horde of zombies has gathered at the bottom of the onramps and in the underpass down on the street level. Damn, there must be close to a thousand of them. Interestingly though, there are no zombies on the ramps themselves and only a few milling about on the highway overpass. It\u2019s like they all came down off the highway for some reason. Maybe chasing some poor survivor to his doom, you think glumly.\n\n\nGetting a bit closer, you see a small plaza on the south side of the street, on this side of the underpass. From your current position, crouched down between abandoned cars, you can make out a pizza shop, laundromat, dollar store, and a small pharmacy in the plaza. Unfortunately, the plaza looks completely jacked. The pizza shop appears to have burnt down, taking half of the laundromat with it; while all the windows and doors have been smashed out of the dollar store and pharmacy. What looks very much like a set of rotor blades has even crashed in through the front of the pharmacy, partially collapsing the front awning. Looking closer at the burnt-out pizza shop, you do indeed make out the charred remains of what appears to have been a news helicopter. All that and the place is strewn with mangled bodies of the dead, all torn up far too much to have risen again as zombies.\n\n\nAs you observe the place, you spot some movement within the shadows of the pharmacy.

Looking around, you don\u2019t see any zombies in the alley with you, so you take the time to move a large metal trashcan up against the fence to climb onto and get a look over the other side.\n\n\nStanding there on the trashcan, you can see that you are less than a hundred feet from the highway, with only a shallow drainage canal and short rise standing between you and the guardrails running along the highway above. Looking north and south, you see that there are no zombies in the space here between the city blocks and the highway itself, although you can see the mob of them a half block to the south, clustered at the bottom of the highway onramps. If you move carefully, you should be able to get up onto the highway unseen.\n\n\nAs you are standing there, you hear a sudden moan and look behind you to see three zombies wandering into the end of the alley with you.

He\u2019s banged up a bit from the fall, but will be OK.\n\n\nThe zombies on the other side of the fence begin to howl angrily and scrabble at the fence trying to get through. Fortunately, the fence is hefty enough to keep them contained and you are far enough away from the mob of zombies at the underpass that they can\u2019t hear the commotion over their own moaning din.\n\n\nKeeping low, you and Jacob make your way across the shallow drainage canal and up the short rise to the highway. Jumping over the guardrails, the two of you move low through the vehicles left bumper-to-bumper on what has now become and endless parking lot in each direction.

As you travel along, you keep an eye out for other drugstores or pharmacies, but don\u2019t see any. You do note however, that pretty much all of the small businesses you pass along the way, regardless of what they once sold, have been thoroughly ransacked and looted. It\u2019s not giving you any great confidence that you\u2019re going to be able to find the drugs you need to fight this infection.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so, you and Jacob near the railroad tracks and can actually see the train bridge rising up in the distance to the north of you, where it begins to cross the Indian River into the city. You move closer and arrive at the tracks to see that they are fenced-off from the residential areas on either side. Looking up and down their length, you see that they are clear of any zombies.\n\n\nHelping Jacob over the fence (a little more carefully this time) and then scaling it yourself, the two of you begin walking south down the railroad tracks, knowing that you\u2019re only four miles to your car.

Another road intersects the main road down at the south end of the cemetery, going east and west. Unlike the city, you note a distinct lack of gridlock in the streets.

If you and the kid can find a working vehicle, you should be able to maneuver your way down the roads without too much trouble.\n\n\nYou also see that there are still plenty of zombies in the streets, but they are spread out in small clusters, rather than giant hordes of hundreds and thousands. It might be a little harder to move around unseen, due to the lack of cover in the streets, but the zombies will have farther to go to get to you and there will be less of them.\n\n\nSo where to now? You wonder to yourself. You need to find a drugstore (or something) to get meds for this infection. Thinking about it, you know that there is a drugstore near your home, but that is at least ten miles away. There has to be a drugstore somewhere here in the northern suburbs, but it\u2019d probably be more to the west between the highway and railroad tracks.\n\n\nEither way, you should probably try to get a working vehicle and drive there \u2013 or at least to the commuter parking lot, where you left your own car.

Carefully taking a look over the wall, you see an expansive walled cemetery on the other side. Rows and rows of headstones and markers cross a quarter mile wide field, running almost a half mile in length. Large mausoleums, shrines, and memorials dot the area, amid small clusters of trees and decorative shrubbery. A fancy cobblestone road winds its way through the rows, to allow vehicles to dive through the various sections.\n\n\nYou note the high grass, which seems out of place here; even though you know that no one in their right mind would be out mowing it in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.

You half expect to see zombies clawing their way out of the very ground, but the place is undefiled and calm.\n\n\nLooking across to the far side, you can see a number of wrought-iron gates set at even intervals in the stone wall. The gates are all closed. Beyond them, you can see that a main road runs alongside the cemetery, but because of the wall, you cannot see from here whether there are any vehicles on it. You do note some movement in that direction however, and spot a small number of zombies wandering around outside the wall. A quick \u2018head count\u2019 tallies seven zombies in sight. It\u2019s a nice change from the hundreds and thousands you\u2019ve seen on the other side of the river. It looks like any attempts to contain the zombie outbreak to the city has failed, but at least there seems to be less of them out here in the suburbs.\n\n\nLooking to the west, you note a two-story stone house with a slate roof, nestled behind a ring of trees on the far end or the cemetery grounds. It must be the groundskeeper\u2019s home. You climb over the wall and begin heading in that direction. If you can get to the main road beyond the house unseen, you might be able to get your hands on a vehicle. As you get closer to the house, you can see that all the first floor windows of the house have been boarded up; and that it has a large two port garage next to it, and an open steel shed with a yellow backhoe tractor parked under it. A quad ATV with a small trailer attached is also parked in front of the garage.\n\n\nAs you are taking in the details, an older man in his middle to late fifties, suddenly leans out a window on the second floor and levels a .22 caliber rifle at you.\n\n\n\u201cWhoa whoa!\u201d you say, showing that you are not a zombie.\n\n\nThe man raises the barrel up and yells down \u201cWhat do you want?

From here, you can see that a quarter-mile long section of the bridge has collapsed out of the center \u2013 the far end actually dipping at a steep angle into the river itself. You can even make out a few vehicles still on that section of the bridge and imagine there must have been many more, but that they all slid right into the river when the bridge went down.

Observing the shore itself, you notice hundreds of fish floating belly-up among the frothy gray foam lapping up against the rocks. As you are looking, you actually see a body or two floating by in the water.\n\n\nLooking up and down the river, you see a number of large concrete pipes \u2013 all dumping stuff into the river. You never noticed this before, when crossing the river on the train or in your car, and wonder if it has something to do with the city\u2019s power being down for so long.\n\n\nYou go back to the east side of the bridge and look down river again, regarding the boat club and abandoned ferry station about two miles down the shore.\n\n\nFrom here you can see that the boat club is on your side of the ferry station, about a hundred yards closer \u2013 and not a single boat appears to be in any of its seven floating docks \u2013 unless you count the blackened burned down hulls of a large trawler and three sailboats near the charred remains of the dock\u2019s fueling station.

The place is nothing more than an open steel structure over the top of a wide stone pier that juts out into the river.

Your wife\u2019s parents are both still alive, still married, and live in sunny Arizona. They fly you and the family out to their ranch every Christmas, along with the rest of their own family. Your wife has many brothers and sisters, but you really don\u2019t interact with them very much (except over the holiday) and don\u2019t even know all of their names.

You were a boy-scout and have some basic survival skills, including being able to handle firearms \u2013 or at least you know how to shoot skeet with a shotgun. How much different can blasting zombies in the head be? Now, if you could only get your hands on some more ammo \u2013 you got slightly more zombies to deal with than you have shots left\u2026\n\n\nYou also worry greatly for your family. Your wife would be home \u2013 hopefully barricaded in, while your girls would have been on the bus to school at the time of the outbreak. Damn! You hope they at least made it to the school, knowing that in such an emergency the school would initiate a lockdown. Maybe they are safe inside waiting for help. You hope so.\n\n\nLooking out the window, you see a clearer picture of the parking lot and backstreet below the courthouse, than you did last night.\n\n\nYou\u2019re glad you waited until daylight, as there are far more zombies in the area than you had initially thought. You are still close enough to the police precinct house, where the zombies are all being attracted to, that the streets are completely packed with them. The parking lot itself is not quite so crowded, as the zombies more or less tend to gravitate towards each other in the streets, but you really don\u2019t see any avenue of escape from there either.\n\n\nYou are about to give up on trying to escape the courthouse through the library window, when you suddenly spot a manhole cover on the far side of the parking lot. The problem with the manhole is that it\u2019s got the front of a car parked over it. You can just make out the rim of the manhole sticking out from under the front bumper. Man, you\u2019d never have spotted that at night \u2013 good thing you waited.\n\n\nThe front door of the car parked over the manhole is open, which probably means the vehicle\u2019s battery is dead \u2013 not that you\u2019d actually want to start it and attract all the zombies to your position. Still, you could stealth your way among the cars in the lot to that particular one, and then shift it into neutral, to push the car silently back enough from the manhole that you could open it up and get in.\n\n\nYou figure you have a decent chance of pulling it off. And at least this particular manhole cover won\u2019t have a sniper or two waiting above to pick you off as you try to get near it.\n\n\nGathering your resolve and steeling your nerve, you open the window as far as it will go and carefully slip out. As you are only on the second floor of the courthouse, you simply hang yourself down off the slight ledge under the window and drop the remaining six feet. You land behind a parked car and crouch low, waiting a moment to make sure none of the zombies have spotted you.\n\n\nWhen it looks like you are in the clear, you slowly make your way to the far side of the parking lot, ducking low and easily maneuvering around the one or two zombies still in the parking lot. Arriving at the car, you see that you only need to push it back a couple of inches to get access to the manhole cover.\n\n\nClimbing into the car, you note that the keys are still in it. You try to shift the car into neutral, but the shifter won\u2019t budge. You realize that you\u2019ll need to turn the key first to unlock the mechanism. Carefully turning the key just enough to free the shifter, while not starting the engine itself, you are surprised to hear the car suddenly bing loudly \u2013 indicating that the door is open.\n\n\nShit! The zombies near the parking lot suddenly perk up and begin turning toward the sound of the noise! Cursing, you throw the car into neutral and turn off the key. Scrambling out of the car, you see about a dozen zombies slowly wandering in your direction. They haven\u2019t seen you yet \u2013 or they wouldn\u2019t just be wandering slowly, so you at least have that in your favor.\n\n\nWith only moments to act, you decide to:", "action_results": [null, null]}]}]}, {"action": "Don\u2019t risk it and escape out the back now!", "result": "You got to get out of this noxious gas now! Moving carefully through the twisted bars between the cells, you go over to the hole in the back wall and look out.\n\n\nYou see a twelve foot gap between the police precinct house and the adjacent city courthouse. A very tall curtained window on the courthouse side, directly across from you, has been blown in by the blast. While you can\u2019t see past the curtains, you figure the tall windows along that side of the building must lead into large courtrooms.\n\n\nIf you take a running start from inside the cell, you should be able to jump straight across the gap and into the window on the other side. If the courthouse isn\u2019t so full of the walking dead that you get eaten alive before you can make it out of there\u2026 well, then you should be OK.\n\n\nLooking down, you note that like the streets, the walkway between the two buildings is also thoroughly packed with zombies. They have reacted to the shower of concrete and broken glass that fell down on their heads from the explosion \u2013 reaching up at you now and gnashing their teeth hungrily.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not them that you\u2019re worried about however; it\u2019s the snipers on the roof. With the sound of the explosion, you know that it\u2019s only a matter of moments before they\u2019ll be looking down over the side to see what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nYou move back and take a running start \u2013 jumping across the gap. About halfway across, you realize you are going to fall a little short. Fortunately, you are able to kick your feet out in front of you and grab hold of the window sill with your hands as you come down. Hanging from the sill with your feet on the wall below you allows you to quickly push yourself up and into the window.\n\n\nAs you are crossing the sill into the room beyond, you abruptly hear a loud crack echo through the gap between the buildings and feel something slam through your back and out the front of your chest. Looking down, you see a spray of your own blood and quickly black out.\n\n\nThe next thing you know, you are standing on the window sill in some sort of bizarre out of body experience, looking down at your own body, now tangled in the long curtains and bleeding out through a center-mass shot through the back. High above you, you see a sniper rifle pointing down over the side of the precinct house roof. Nice shot, you can\u2019t help but think to yourself.\n\n\nThen looking back across the gap between the buildings, you see that strange shadowy black specter from your unconscious subway dreams, standing in the blown out hole you just jumped through. As it regards you with unknown intent, you wonder what it is and what it wants with you \u2013 but that is another story\u2026\n\n\nEND", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Just wait to see what happens...", "result": "After a couple of minutes, the doctor comes over from his work. \u201cMy my, what an extraordinary condition!

Part of the back wall of the building has also blown out; and the bars between the two cells are now broken and twisted. Strange fizzing blood fills the bottom of the crater, boiling itself into a steamy red vapor that now fills the lab \u2013 and reeks of rotting flesh with a harsh acidic edge.\n\n\nLooking at the doctor and officer, you see their clothing being eaten away by the red mists, and then they start screaming \u2013 as their skin starts to bubble and sag, suddenly falling from their bones in great swaths.
