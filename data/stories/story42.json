You curl up in a ball and hold your ears half expecting the entire house to collapse in on you, but it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nYou stay in the basement, for what you guess to be a week. You mostly stumble around in the darkness as reality begins to set in and destroy your previous delusions. You mainly think about how you should\u2019ve planned things out better, especially since your food and drink are running out. The only thing you know really know about nuclear attacks is what you\u2019ve learned from movies, video games and comic books. You can only hope some of that shit was helpful, as you have little choice, but to leave your basement, the bucket you were using to relieve yourself down there was really starting to stink anyway.\n\nYou open up your basement door, which remarkably stayed intact, along with most of your house. The windows and other glass objects have all broke, and there\u2019s no power, but that\u2019s about it. You can only guess that whatever it was that hit, was far enough away and probably very low yield. You don\u2019t really want to think about the radioactivity factor though; you\u2019ll know if you\u2019re catching a lethal dose soon enough if your hair and teeth start falling out and you begin vomiting blood.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter\u2026\n\nYou check the refrigerator again for more food, but there won\u2019t be enough to last you one day. You wonder if the water is still working and turn on the faucet, of course it doesn\u2019t, you don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to risk drinking any of it anyway. Well it looks like you can\u2019t stay in your house either; you\u2019re going to have to leave to find food and some sort of drinkable liquid.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter\u2026\n\nWell if you\u2019re going to leave, you decide some sort of protection is in order; you grab some dishwashing gloves underneath the sink, some safety goggles you\u2019ve had since you college chemistry class, a winter coat and finally a scarf your grandmother knit you for one of your birthdays to wrap over your mouth. You look somewhat silly in this getup and it probably won\u2019t protect you at all, but you\u2019re back to deluding yourself again which is probably a good thing since your relapses into fantasy are keeping you from breaking down completely.\n\nYou open your dented garage door and get in your old van expecting it not to work, surprisingly it does. You thought it wouldn\u2019t due to all that stuff you remember hearing about EMP waves or something, then again your car was built in a year before they started mounting entire computers in the fucking things, so maybe that\u2019s why it still works. You don\u2019t know, you\u2019re just glad its one of the things you still have that functions, you didn\u2019t want to be riding that bike you bought and hardly ever used. You throw your backpack of useful items (flashlight, small tool set, first aid kit, etc) into the van and ponder where to go.\n\nYou\u2019ve got two choices that immediately come to mind assuming both still exist; one is that \u201cMom & Pop\u201d General Store that was abandoned at least a month ago. You can\u2019t imagine they took everything from the place. The other choice is to risk going to the city and finding something there. Despite all the looting and mass exodus that was going on there before any of this went down, the city\u2019s still a big place and there\u2019s probably lots of useful stuff there, the problem is wondering if you\u2019ll be heading into a death zone. That radioactivity concern is still in the back of your mind.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to the general store", "result": "You might be absorbing more rads than usual now, but heading to the city would just be retarded. You\u2019d probably die of cancer just going near the place; everything there would be contaminated anyway. You don\u2019t even want to see the survivors what the survivors might look like assuming there were any. You head for the general store, that\u2019s at least a safer bet.\n\nYou drive your Van to the general store not very far from your house. You remember the old guy who ran the place; Billy. He was always alright with you. Whenever you went in to buy food, he was always talking about how bad the state of world was getting and how he was going to be  prepared for when the nukes started flying. You\u2019re guessing he probably invested in one of those Ground Zero Survival Shelters you always saw for sale on TV and took himself and his wife to it. The last time you saw the place it was all boarded up and looked closed up for good, still it\u2019s a start.\n\nYou arrive at the store which is still all boarded up like the last time you\u2019ve seen it. You always found it weird that Billy bothered to board the place up, if he was going to abandon it. Surely he couldn\u2019t have thought things would be restored so quickly after a nuclear exchange that he\u2019d be able to return some day.\n\nYou get out of your van and study the store more closely which you never bothered to do before, the windows are boarded up from the outside, but upon closer inspection the door hasn\u2019t been boarded up at all. You try the door, but it\u2019s firmly locked. Nothing else for it, but to bash it down. You begin prying, slamming, kicking and everything else to the door, but its not budging and you only succeed in bruising your shoulder. In frustration you pull out your pistol and finally just shoot at the lock and then try to open it, which it does slightly, something else is barring the door from the inside though. You\u2019re going to have to start ramming the thing again to shove it open enough to get inside.\n\nSuddenly you hear some noise from inside and the click of a shotgun, it\u2019s also only just then you realize that Billy\u2019s pick up truck is still parked by the side of his store. He\u2019s obviously still here and you were oblivious to the fact.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it Martha, hasn\u2019t been a month yet an\u2019 we already got scum tryin\u2019 ta loot the place!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Billy. You thought he left, but apparently not. He just made it look like he did and barricaded himself inside.\n\n\u201cAlright you looting shit stain, you better just get the fuck outta here right now, \u2018fore you find yourself with a new hole in your chest!\u201d Billy says from inside.\n\u201cWhoa Billy it\u2019s me! I used to shop here! Come on open up, I\u2019m not a looter!\u201d you reply.\n\u201c\u2026(sigh) hold on, and back away from the goddamn door.\u201d\n\nYou back away as Billy presumably moves whatever was still blocking the door. When he finally opens it up, he stands in the doorway still pointing his shotgun at you.\n\n\u201cDamnation boy, I coulda blown your head off! You fuckin\u2019 destroyed my lock! What the hell are you wearin\u2019?\u201d Billy asks looking at your silly form of protection.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I thought you abandoned this place.\u201d\n\u201cOh and that gave you the excuse to break in? What\u2019re you think yer doin\u2019 anyway? Why aren\u2019t you in your shelter or something?\u201d\n\u201cCause I don\u2019t have one that\u2019s why! I was going to see if this place had any supplies and maybe stay here, if it wasn\u2019t in bad condition.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well, sorry to crush yer dreams, but this place is still occupied and OWNED by me. You\u2019re gonna have to skedaddle. Just enough supplies for me and my wife.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo buts! Now you were a good customer an\u2019 all, but this is a new world and the rules have severely changed! It\u2019s all about survival now. And it\u2019s not my fault your ass didn\u2019t prepare for somethin\u2019 that was comin\u2019 for a long time! Now if you don\u2019t leave now I\u2019m gonna be less understanding about this lack of judgment on your part. Bye and good luck.\u201d\n\u201cNo wait!\u201d\n\nAt this point Billy slams the door shut mumbling about the lock being destroyed and going to have to fix it. Billy must have some sort of private bomb shelter of his own, if he barricaded himself inside his own store. One that must be stocked pretty well to sustain him and his wife for a good amount of time.\n\nAn idea races through your head that you never thought you\u2019d consider, well not before the nukes hit anyway, but Billy\u2019s statement of \u201cThis is about survival\u201d rings true. It IS about survival, and not just his.\n\nYou don\u2019t really want to do this, but you feel like you have no other choice.\n\nBilly is still trying to barricade the door, when you take another forceful charge into it.  \nYour attempt is successful this time as it flies open causing Billy to fall and drop the heavy box he was going to place in front of it. The box half lands on Billy causing him crushing pain while he struggles to grab his shotgun from the floor. You\u2019re quicker though and point your own pistol at him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t grab that shotgun Billy\u2026I don\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d you say\n\u201cGoddamn sonofabitch, you ain\u2019t taking this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBilly what\u2019s\u2026 OH MY GOD!\u201d\n\nWhen you hear Martha\u2019s outburst, it startles you during this already tense moment, you end up turning around and firing. You hit Martha square in the chest; she looks down briefly in shock before falling over dead. You\u2019re a little in shock yourself.\n\n\u201cMARTHA!\u201d Billy screams, causing you to face him once more, he\u2019s now actually grabbed the shotgun, and you begin babbling.\n\n\u201cOh God! Oh man! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to do that! She came up and\u2026Billy don\u2019t do that\u2026I don\u2019t want to\u2026please\u2026\u201d\n\nYou fire again, hitting Billy in the head, splattering his brains all over the floor and killing him instantly.\n\nYou feel sick and promptly run outside to vomit. You\u2019ve never killed anyone before, though you don\u2019t think it was that, that made you sick. It was the fact you murdered two people who were really innocent. You were the trespasser and when you couldn\u2019t get what you wanted, you took it by force. You acted like a criminal even if there\u2019s no such thing as \u201claw\u201d anymore. You sit down in a daze for a few minute trying to take all this in, before realizing you have to take care of some clean up first.\n\nYou remove the bodies of Billy and Martha from the store. (You also remove your silly \u201cprotection wear\u201d, well except the dishwashing gloves for moving the bodies) You wonder where you\u2019re going put them, but eventually you decide to just dump them in the wilderness nearby, you figure nature will take its course.\n\nYou go back to the store and re-barricade it. The store itself is empty, but in a back room, you discover a trapdoor. You descend and discover a large shelter with a treasure of food and water supplies, along with other useful items like first aid kits. Looks like Billy was more prepared than you could\u2019ve imagined. One necessity you\u2019re glad to find is a bathroom facility with a sink and toilet, there\u2019s a little bit of water seeping from the cracks of the walls. Billy must\u2019ve hit the jackpot and found an underground water source and built a crude plumbing system. He\u2019s also installed a small hydro generator which would explain how come there\u2019s dim lighting down here.\n\nFinally you see some survivalist books Billy had on a small bookshelf by a bed and a couple of hunting rifles along with ammunition for them and the shotgun you\u2019ve recently acquired as well.\n\nWell you\u2019re certainly set up, and all you had to do was kill an old couple. As you lie down on the bed you think about your actions in greater depth now. You\u2019re not sure how to feel. Part of you wants to feel bad, but somehow you can\u2019t make yourself feel as bad as you probably should. In fact you\u2019re already starting to rationalize your actions. The first murder was a mistake, and the second one was self-defense.\n\n\u201cAnd this is survival.\u201d You say and fall asleep.\n\nThe next day you wake up, you feel the most refreshed than you have in a long time.\n\nSomething has changed within you. You don\u2019t recognize immediately, but as a few months go by you begin to.\n\nGranted you were never a big one for human contact, anti-social and reclusive even, but this \u201cline\u201d you\u2019ve crossed recently, your continued isolation, and the absence of civilization have made you become a little unhinged.\n\nYou also start becoming paranoid, about other people stumbling across your new place and attempt to break in and take it like you did. Using the knowledge you\u2019ve been getting from the survivalist books, you start setting up traps, inside and outside the store. One time, you spend just about a whole day doing that. When the darkness approaches you go back to your underground haven to descend further into quiet madness, before you fall asleep.\n\nSuddenly in the middle of the night you hear a noise and a scream from above. Sounds like it\u2019s coming from outside and from more than one person. You immediately grab your shotgun and head upstairs.\n\nAfter going through the typical routine of taking down the barricades, you open the door and see a family in panic. A man is lying on the ground yelling in pain from the snap trap that has obviously broken his leg. A woman and a little boy are screaming frantically and totally clueless of what to do in this situation.\n\nLooks like your traps work.\n\nThe family hasn\u2019t seen you yet and don\u2019t know your intentions, come to think of it, you aren\u2019t even sure of your intentions\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Finish them off", "result": "Obviously they thought they could just stroll in and take shelter here, bad mistake on\ntheir part\u2026\n\n\nYou calmly point the shotgun at the man caught in the trap and blast him before he even notices you. The little boy now really begins screaming, but the woman just becomes silent and falls into shock turning her head in your direction covered in the blood of her husband.\n\nYou don\u2019t feel sick like you did last time; you do feel an overwhelming sense of power though.\n\nThe woman grabs her son\u2019s hand and turns to run, but realizes two seconds later that she\u2019s only holding on to his hand and the rest of him is lying on the ground, one arm less, from your second blast.\n\n\u201cWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!\u201d the woman screams.\n\u201cBecause I can, and there\u2019s nobody around to stop me.\u201d You say and briskly walk over to the woman. After a pathetic struggle you knock her out and drag her into your new home.\n\nAfter all, you\u2019re not sure when you\u2019ll get to see another woman again\u2026\n\nA couple days after the incident with the family (and disposing of all three bodies) you begin keeping yourself in better shape. You start exercising regularly, and fixing up your home. You need to be prepared, in case more people ever show up. You MUST defend yourself and your home. You don\u2019t get many, but every now and then another poor soul stumbles across your death lair. You\u2019re merciless. Soon you begin to arrange the vehicles of your victims to form a semi \u201cwall\u201d around your home and place some grisly totems as \u201cdecoration\u201d.\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t get visitors anymore, though that\u2019s probably because of the unfriendly image you\u2019ve projected with all the skulls you\u2019ve stuck on the spikes outside. Part of you is glad that you aren\u2019t being disturbed anymore, but the other part misses the killing. You begin to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t start venturing out more, but you\u2019d hate to leave your home.\n\nOne day you\u2019re awakened by the roar of motorcycles. You\u2019ve got visitors again, you ready your weapons. As you head upstairs you hear that inevitable \u201cSNAP!\u201d sound followed by screaming. Yet another victim to your traps, though you hear the typical sounds of distress, you also hear some laughter, taunting even, which has got you more curious than anything.\n\nYou check through a little peephole you made and see a bunch of biker types, one is lying on the ground, his leg nearly severed by the hidden bear trap. While one is trying to free him, a couple of the others are just laughing and remarking about how it looks like it really hurts.\n\n\u201cAAAAAARGH! AGHHH!\u201d\n\u201cLook are you assholes going to help or not?\u201d one of them asks.\n\u201cHey, I told you fuckers not to go traipsing into a place that has skulls stuck on stakes. Y\u2019all should\u2019ve known it wasn\u2019t exactly going to be a friendly place.\u201d\n\u201cWe need fuckin\u2019 gas Jim, and this place has a lot of vehicles, and maybe some of them have gas. We had to go check!\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but that didn\u2019t mean just walking around unaware of your surroundings\u2026shit that leg looks bad.\u201d\n\u201cGET IT OFF! AAAAHHHH!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat leg is bad. Even if you did get it off of him, he\u2019s probably going to lose it to infection. I wiped my own shit on it, not to mention it was developing a nice set of rust on it when I found it.  I\u2019d say his bike riding days are over.\u201d You say standing your doorway with your shotgun ready. The bikers look in your direction, one looks like he\u2019s going to pull his pistol, but the one called Jim stops him. He\u2019s obviously the leader.\n\n\u201cYou might be right, stranger, but that still leaves you outnumbered one to three. You sure you wanna take those odds?\u201d Jim says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2018em and I\u2019ll enjoy it. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve killed a whole mess of people.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a REAL killer eh?\u201d\n\u201cBetter killer than you.\u201d\n\u201cHah! I doubt that! See me an\u2019 the boys here have been raisin\u2019 hell where ever we can. Come across a few towns and let\u2019s just say we\u2019re not real welcome there anymore. It\u2019s a brand new world, and only the strong are gonna survive it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well it looks like one of your flock isn\u2019t so strong now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026well you might be right about that stranger\u2026maybe someone should put him out of his misery. Can\u2019t very well ride with one leg, that\u2019d be kind of silly.\u201d\n\nThe biker trying to help speaks up.\n\n\u201cOh come on Jim man! Clyde here saved all of our asses about a month ago!\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well what has he done for us lately? The stranger\u2019s right, we gotta put him down, it\u2019s the kind thing to do really. You gonna do it, Dan?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026I\u2026mean\u2026well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPussy. Nevermind. Ramon you gonna do it?\u201d\n\u201cShit yeah! Here hold on, oh fuck.\u201d Ramon says pulling out his pistol and then dropping it on the ground. Jim just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cRamon, its amazing you\u2019ve even lasted this long with your clumsy ass. Fuck it, I\u2019LL do it.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Let Jim kill Clyde", "result": "As strange as it may seem, you\u2019re kind of glad for the company believe it or not, so you\u2019d rather just let this play out and see where it leads. You can always kill them all later.\n\nMeanwhile Jim is pointing his gun at Clyde\u2019s head in an overly dramatic manner.\n\n\u201cAlright Clyde you knew the risks. No begging or pleadin\u2019 now.\u201d\n\u201cCome on Jim! Don\u2019t do this! I can still ride\u2026I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn it, get a fuckin\u2019 hold of yourself you fuckin\u2019 sissy! Fuck, I was givin\u2019 you a chance to go out like a man! Guess you fucked that up. Die bitch!\u201d\n\nJim blows Clyde\u2019s brains out, and turns his attention back to you.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give him a fair chance.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026so what do you have planned now?\u201d you ask, forming an idea in your mind.\n\u201cPlanned? Ha ha! We don\u2019t do a whole lotta planning, we just kinda roam from place to place causing meaningless violence! I think there\u2019s a town around in this area somewhere\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou probably should look for a more reliable fuel source, if you\u2019re going to continue with this line of work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well we\u2019ll be good after Ramon here sucks out the remaining gas from this vehicle graveyard you got here. I trust YOU won\u2019t have a problem with that right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sucking what?!\u201d Ramon says with a surprised look on his face.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a problem with it, but what happens when that runs out? Are you going hope you find some more in your travels?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worked so far\u2026what the hell are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cInstead of spreading meaningless violence on a small scale, how about spreading meaningful violence on a grand scale for a change?\u201d\n\nYou explain how you\u2019ve been reading in the survivalist books about how to create a still, except not being a drinker; you never felt the need to create one. However that same cheap hooch could probably work as a substitute for real gas, if certain modifications were made to the vehicles. Basically the vehicles would be running on \u201cgarbage\u201d given that\u2019s what the booze is made out of. It would smell horrible, but you get the impression that Jim and his boys wouldn\u2019t know the difference anyway. You begin to explain even more technical aspects as well, but you soon realize it\u2019s too much to process for them, so you stop before their heads explode.\n\n\nThey do realize you seem to be a lot smarter than the rest of them though, so they agree to your \u201cgrand\u201d plan. You tell one of them that they should drive to the nearest town by themselves, try to get a feel of the place, to scout the entire place out, find out what the defenses are and all of that.\n\nUltimately Dan is chosen for this task since he can actually come off as being a nice guy. You give him some canned food and some bottled water you have. You explain that he should use the stuff as something to barter with, so it looks like he\u2019s just a wandering traveler.\n\nWhile Dan goes and does some scouting, you get to work on the still and Jim and Ramon, work on their altering their bikes (At least they know how to do that) a few days pass and you all generally start getting along. Unsurprisingly Jim and the rest of his gang were criminals even before the bombs dropped. You lie and say you were in the life of crime as well, nothing too specific though and just common and vague enough for Jim to believe. Of course all the people you killed after the bombs, you don\u2019t need to lie about at all.\n\nWhen Dan comes back, he does so with some interesting news. He mentions the closest town is Cinderville. He mentions it\u2019s not a completely harmonious town and it does have its rougher elements, but the local law enforcement is still in control of the place and relies on a vigilante mindset of some of the townspeople. Apparently they\u2019re trying to keep the resemblance of the \u201cold world\u201d. He mentions there\u2019s another gang that hangs around the outskirts of it which attempts raids every now and then, but they\u2019re poorly lead. Finally he states they have a small farming area with animals like cows and pigs. Not all for eating, but to mainly produce shit for biofuel to run the law enforcement vehicles.\n\nOriginally you were just thinking you could strike hard and fast and get out, every few months to break up the monotony, with the still to keep your vehicle running so you could engage in this behavior. But with this new information, of other gangs in the area and bad elements in the actual little oasis of civilization, you wonder if you couldn\u2019t actually take over the town, at the very least you could destabilize it. The biofuel center wouldn\u2019t be a bad acquisition either. You\u2019re confident you can pull this off, you just need more help.", "action_results": [{"action": "Recruit some of the locals", "result": "You decide that the locals have more intimate knowledge of the town and would probably be better to enlist help from. You suggest that you all go to Cinderville and do just that.\n\nAfter re-trapping your home, and gathering what supplies you think you\u2019ll need, you and the bikers all take a trip to Cinderville (You take your Van). After about a day of traveling you arrive at the place.\n\nHowever you don\u2019t get very far. The townsfolk remember Dan, and the cops were watching him the whole time he entered town. They didn\u2019t really buy his whole \u201cwandering traveler\u201d act and neither did most other people. They figured he was up to no good. So when all of you come rolling in, the cops instantly arrive and tell you to leave immediately.\n\nNormally you might\u2019ve done that and come up with another strategy, but Jim begins revving up his cycle and shooting at the fuckers and disregards whatever plan you had. His boys follow suit.\n\nAfter seeing Ramon getting his head blown off and Jim get shot off his bike, you have no intention of sharing that fate, so you swerve to turn the van around\u2026which promptly dies on the spot.\n\n\u201cSHIT! GODDAMN IT! I JUST FIXED IT!\u201d you shout beating on the wheel.\n\u201cGIVE UP, ALL YOUR LOWLIFE BUDDIES ARE DEAD! GET OUTTA THE VAN NOW ASSHOLE!\u201d you hear one of the cops shout in a bullhorn.\n\nDo they really expect you to give up? This is a brand new world, the cops don\u2019t need to put anyone in jail anymore; they can just shoot criminals. Not to mention, Dan had mentioned a vigilante mindset of the common townsfolk. They probably have every intention in hanging your ass, assuming they don\u2019t shoot you immediately after you give up.\n\nFuck it; you ain\u2019t going out without a fight. Hell maybe you\u2019ll even get back home, probably not. (Sigh) you think maybe you should\u2019ve just stayed in your nice home waylaying wanderers when they came by. Too late for that now though.\n\nYou grab the hunting rifle and put it on your back, check your pistol, and grab your shotgun to be your primary weapon. You take a deep breath and open up sliding door of your van and blast the first pig you see and make a break for it.\n\nYou manage to get a few blocks with the cops in pursuit, before one of the neighborhood \u201cRambos\u201d shoots at you, hitting you in the leg. You fall to the street hard, dropping your shotgun which spirals out of your hand several feet from you. You get some pay back by blasting the shithead who shot you in the leg when he came closer to confirm the \u201ckill\u201d.\n\nYou struggle to stand up, only to get hit by a fucking police car fully intent on running you down, except you go flying in the air instead and land on your face again with a pair of broken legs now. The car stops and a police woman with dreadlocks gets out, she shoots you in the arm, when you attempt to go for your pistol.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re under arrest suga!\u201d she says in a high voice.\n\nYou merely turn to look at her, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\n\u201cFuck you bitch.\u201d\n\u201cYou wish honey!\u201d\n\nAnd with that last snappy come back, she decides that you were resisting arrest and shoots you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Approach the raiders", "result": "Entering the town again, wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. From the sound of it, the town is suspicious of outsiders, if Dan showed up again with the lot of you; they\u2019d know something was up. Not to mention he was the most \u201cpresentable\u201d of all of you. You figure the raiders might be a better choice. If they\u2019re poorly led, then maybe just taking care of the leader will make the rest fall in line.\n\n\u201cAlright Dan, you know where the raiders hang out?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, not exactly, but its somewhere in the hills near Cinderville.\u201d\n\u201cOkay let\u2019s go there. We can probably kick the leader\u2019s ass and\u2026\u201d\n\nJim all of sudden stops you in mid-sentence.\n\n\n\u201cHold up, brain boy. I know you got all these great ideas, and you seem to be a pretty ruthless sonofabitch, and I respect that, but let\u2019s keep in mind that I\u2019M running this fuckin\u2019 gang. Don\u2019t presume you can just order us all around about what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d He tells you in an authoritative voice and implies bodily harm if you disagree with him.\n\n(Sigh) You had a feeling this was going to happen.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Jim", "result": "\u201cY\u2019know what, you\u2019re right Jim, you shouldn\u2019t have to take orders from me.\u201d\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad we understand each other.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you won\u2019t be around to do it any longer!\u201d\n\nBefore anyone can do anything, you draw your pistol and shoot Jim three times in the chest before he falls dead. Ramon and Dan look like they want to react, but don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cGood. Glad to see you guys are smarter than you appear. Now Dan, lead us to the raiders.\u201d\n\nAfter taking some supplies you think you\u2019ll need and re-trapping your home, you all set off to leave. (You take your van)\n\nIn about a day, you arrive around in the area that Dan was talking about, in fact you don\u2019t need to look for the raiders; they instantly approach you when they see you coming. It would appear some of them have a few vehicles as well, you just hope you can pull this off.\n\nYou get out of your van and your two new lackeys stop their bikes, they don\u2019t like the looks of this, especially since you\u2019re greatly outnumbered.\n\n\u201cHey, uh\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea\u2026\u201d Ramon says.\n\u201cYeah, when I was in Cinderville, I heard these guys could get pretty crazy.\u201d Dan adds.\n\u201cPfft, these types always fall in line when you display sufficient strength. All I gotta do is challenge the leader to hand to hand combat or some shit. Hell, you fuckers were in prison, you know how this works.\u201d You arrogantly reply.\n\u201cYeah, but even in prison there were rules! I mean there ain\u2019t no rules at all out here! Who says they\u2019re going to accept your challenge?\u201d\n\nWith Dan\u2019s last statement, you figure you\u2019ll soon find out when the raiders arrive and stop their own vehicles. The leader steps out of his beat up car, and steps forward. He looks mean enough, like he\u2019s been living in the wasteland from day one.\n\n\u201cSo, you got any last words, before we fuck you and eat you?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah, I heard you\u2019re the lame cocksucker, who can\u2019t even handle a few pigs and some wannabe vigilantes in Cinderville.\u201d You reply.\n\nThe raider leader\u2019s expression gets even meaner looking if such a thing is possible.\n\n\u201cOh? And I suppose YOU can do a better job?\u201d he sneers.\n\u201cSure the fuck can, all I need is more people. In fact I\u2019d say yours would do just fine, so are you going to step down from your inept leadership, or am I gonna have to beat the shit outta you and take it?\u201d\n\nAfter looking at you up and down, he speaks again.\n\n\u201cShit, I doubt if you could even last five minutes. Fuck this; I\u2019m not wasting my time. Kill these assholes.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he says those words, you immediately turn to run, ducking and trying to get into your van, but in the shooting, the raiders hit the van\u2019s front tires by the time you make it inside. Dan and Ramon speed off, with some of the raiders in pursuit, while you attempt to drive in reverse and turn around on flat tires.\n\nThe raider leader rams your van with his own car, which has been fitted with extra plating. Eventually in the mayhem of the ramming, shooting and swerving around on flat tires on an incline, you roll the van over and over down the hill. It\u2019s amazing that you don\u2019t get killed and the van didn\u2019t blow up.\n\nYou however aren\u2019t in such great shape. You barely manage to crawl from your wrecked van, and when you do, the raider leader arrives in his own car just in time to finish you off.\n\nHe finds you crawling on the ground, when he opens up his door to point a sawed off shotgun in your face and pull the trigger.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Back down", "result": "While you probably could kill this fat fucker, but for now you have to have all the help you can get and no disunity to pull this plan off, so you\u2019ll back down for now\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, I never said I was the leader, I know you are Jim.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Glad we understand each other.\u201d\n\u201cSo go ahead and tell us what YOU think is the best course of action for this plan.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026your strategy sounded pretty good.\u201d Jim says predictably\n\nJust as you thought, you\u2019re STILL in control, just had to give the fool the appearance that he\u2019s still in control.\n\nAfter taking some supplies you think you\u2019ll need and re-trapping your home, you all set off to leave. (You take your van)\n\nIn about a day, you arrive around in the area that Dan was talking about, in fact you don\u2019t need to look for the raiders; they instantly approach you when they see you coming. It would appear some of them have a few vehicles as well. Jim signals for everyone to halt and he gets off his bike. Ramon and Dan halt near Jim, but don\u2019t get off their bikes. You in the meantime grab your hunting rifle and hang in the back a bit, you just hope Jim can pull this shit off, especially since you\u2019re greatly outnumbered.\n\nSoon the raiders arrive and stop their own vehicles. The leader steps out of his beat up car, and steps forward. He looks mean enough, like he\u2019s been living in the wasteland from day one.\n\n\u201cSo, you got any last words, before we fuck you and eat you?\u201d he asks Jim.\n\u201cYeah, I heard you\u2019re the pussy ass bitch, who can\u2019t even handle a few pigs and some fuckin\u2019 vigilantes in Cinderville.\u201d Jim replies.\n\nThe raider leader\u2019s expression gets even meaner looking if such a thing is possible.\n\n\u201cOh? And I suppose YOU can do a better job you fat tub of shit?\u201d he sneers.\n\u201cSure the fuck can asshole, all I need is more men. In fact I\u2019d say yours would do just fine, so I\u2019d say you\u2019d better just step aside and see a pro in action.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so, besides I\u2019ve already seen a fag get his mouth gang fucked by a bunch of guys.\u201d\n\nYou sure hope Jim is a better fighter, because he\u2019s losing in the battle of snappy comebacks right now. In fact he can\u2019t come up with a response, so he just slugs the raider leader instead. You fully expect the shooting to start, but instead the raider leader laughs, pulls out the biggest blade you\u2019ve ever seen and screams \u201cTHIS ONE IS MINE!\u201d\n\nDuring the fight, you scan all your potential greatest threats and the quickest order to pick them off, in case this all goes south. You\u2019re so busy doing that, that you\u2019re not really paying attention to the actual fight, which Jim as it turns out, is winning.\n\nAfter tussling on the ground, slamming into nearby vehicles, punching, kicking and all the rest, Jim finally puts an end to his opponent by shoving his own knife through his throat. Everyone goes silent, and Jim stands up wiping the blood off of himself.\n\n\u201cAlright! Now listen the fuck up! Your previous leader was a lame ass who couldn\u2019t get the job done, and that changes right now! We\u2019re gonna get fuckin\u2019 organized and take that goddamn little town! Might makes fuckin\u2019 right! Are ya with me, or are ya gonna go running off like a limp wristed sissy?\u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t kill Jim, because these raiders seem to really identify with him and they unanimously accept him as their new leader. You doubt if you would\u2019ve had that success. You\u2019ve never been a people person, regardless of who those people might\u2019ve been, however you are an idea person, and now you move on to your next phase.\n\nAfter Jim finally gets all the new people to listen, you begin to explain your plan, the problem before is they kept stupidly attacking from one direction, rather than doing the classic \u201cpincer\u201d maneuver and attacking from multiple sides. Using Dan\u2019s information, you specifically pick out areas where the most damage can initially be done with the least amount of risk. You point out the spot where there\u2019s still an old school being used to teach the children. Take control of that with the kids inside and you\u2019ve severely reduced most of the townspeople\u2019s willingness to fight, which will curb the neighborhood \u201cCharles Bronsons\u201d from helping the police force. In fact you decide to take that job since you want Jim to lead the raiders in the main direct assault force with the cops. Dan and Ramon will be traveling with their own smaller force to attack other parts of the town, spreading out the cops\u2019 usually organized force. It\u2019s also hoped that the more disreputable elements that Dan mentioned living in the town, will join in the mayhem on your side, or at least against their side.\n\nThe raider vehicles themselves are not in the best condition, and most of them are running low on gas, but they\u2019ll do for now. You figure if all goes well, the still fuel that you created back at your home, as well as the farming area in the town with the pig and cow shit biofuel can solve those problems later. In fact you specifically mention that NO damage should happen to that area in this attack, though you don\u2019t expect them to follow that order.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to wait long to attack with this bunch, since they have the attention span of a gnat of crack. You have to attack soon when they\u2019re all hyped up. You suggest that to Jim, who agrees since he\u2019s anxious to get to this dastardly business anyway. In a couple days you\u2019re attacking the town as planned. You start on your end first, making a beeline to the school, before the main attack force arrives.\n\n\nA few of the raiders are in your van itching to start creating some havoc. You stop outside of the school and run inside with your current trigger happy cohorts. A couple of them kill a few kids and you have to remind them you\u2019re SUPPOSED to be holding them hostage right now! If the townsfolk don\u2019t comply THEN you can start capping the little bastards. You tell them to go and kill the teachers if they want.\n\nIn the mean time you take the opportunity to shout from the window to the crowd gathering outside. You tell them that if any of them start trying to defend the town or help the cops, then their kids are going to be killed. To show you\u2019re really serious though, you tell one of the raiders to toss a kid out the window. A collective cry goes up from the crowd when the body hits the pavement and their pathetic begging is pleasing to your ears.\n\nYou get a few people shooting at you anyway (Obviously not parents) but having a good vantage point and a hunting rifle, you start sniping the idiots who have decided to ignore your threats. A few more kids thrown out the window causes ALL the shooting to stop.\n\nYou can hear the sounds of battle from your position; no cops have arrived so you\u2019re guessing Jim and the rest are doing their job. You\u2019re really enjoying all this chaos you\u2019ve created, you were just stagnating before the bombs dropped, now in this new world you\u2019re free to embrace the darkest part of yourself that always existed, but wasn\u2019t allowed the flourish. You love this fucking shit.\n\nEventually you hear a roar of a motorcycle, followed by the sound of some bottles breaking. You go to check the window and see the crowd outside running and screaming, some of them on fire from the Molotov Cocktails just thrown at them. You also see Ramon shouting up to you.\n\n\u201cHey! We\u2019re winning man! The remaining cops are barricaded in their fucking station, broke the Mayor\u2019s legs and dragged him through the street and best of all we got some of the other local punks to join us! There\u2019s practically no more resistance left! Its total fucking anarchy man!\u201d\n\nYou turn around and begin smiling at the kids you\u2019re holding hostage which somehow scares them even more. You pick up a young girl and kiss her hard on the lips and laugh at the fear in her eyes. You then throw her down and tell the raiders with you they can do whatever they want, because you\u2019re going to indulge in some pure havoc on your own.\n\nAfter a couple days and nights of indulging in this activity, Jim finally gets around to settling his new gang down (Which he\u2019s inventively called \u201cJim\u2019s Reapers\u201d) and wondering about what to do with the town now that he has control over it. He seems to have forgotten already that it was YOU, who orchestrated this. Now that the task has been accomplished perhaps this would be the time to discuss the leadership role again.\n\nThen again, you wonder if you even want to bother. Sure there\u2019s the power and such, but there\u2019s also the headache of dealing with all these morons on a regular basis and running the town. The \u201cfun\u201d part is over as it were.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Jim for control of the town", "result": "The whole point of this endeavor was to take control of the town and you\u2019re not going to let Jim get that glory.

His wife is naked in a fetal position in a corner just rocking to herself in a state of perpetual shock, its apparent she\u2019s been raped over and over. Jim doesn\u2019t have anyone else with him, not even have Dan or Ramon, he\u2019s all by himself in a drunken stupor at the moment celebrating his new found power, unaware that you\u2019re about to relieve him of it.\n\n\u201cHeeeeey! Killer! Its you! Have a drink! This fucker\u2019s got some classy shit stashed in his cellar! (Hic!)\u201d\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s okay. So I see you\u2019ve been having fun eh?\u201d\n\u201cMe?

I think me, you, Dan and fuckin\u2019 Ramon are the few straight bastards in this gang! Those fuckin\u2019 raiders we recruited? I ain\u2019t even seen them try to get any of the pussy in this town. They must\u2019ve been in the wasteland too damn long or somethin\u2019, I think they forgot what a god (hic!) damn bitch looks like. Been cornholin\u2019 each other so much they went an\u2019 fell in love! HAR HAR HAR HAR! (hic!) Ah hell I\u2019m not judgin\u2019. (hic!)\u201d\n\nWhile Jim wanders into the next room still talking about his gang\u2019s sexual preference, you go over to the mayor who\u2019s been baring his mental and physical pain in silence the whole time. When you crouch near him and pull your pistol out, he thinks this is it, but you have something \u201cspecial\u201d in mind. You see that his hands are still in good shape so you keep your voice down and look him in the eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna die. Nothing can stop this. Resign yourself to this fact. Life sucks and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d you say unloading your pistol, but keeping one bullet in the chamber.\n\n\u201c\u2026however, you can still get vengeance. I thought you might like to know that I\u2019m the one who planned this attack. I\u2019m the one who orchestrated this town\u2019s destruction. A town you no longer have any control over and has had many of its citizens viciously killed thanks to my actions\u2026 the fat piece of drunken shit in the next room has personally beaten you and violated your wife, repeatedly. Over and over. In front of you. His fat smelly flesh all over her while he enjoyed it the whole time. Probably shoved his cock in all three holes too huh?\u201d\n\nHe looks at you with a mixture of fear, hate, and sorrow, while tears fill his eyes. You place the gun in his hand.\n\n\u201c\u2026well anyway, there\u2019s one bullet in the gun. Remember, you got one shot, one chance for vengeance, make your choice. Better hide that, here comes Jim.\u201d\n\nJim comes stumbling back in room, while the mayor holds the gun close to himself in a bad attempt to hide it. The stand back waiting to see what happens next.\n\n\u201c\u2026I mean hell I\u2019ve fucked a few prags when I (hic!) was in prison, but\u2026hey\u2026what have you got there?\u201d Jim asks seeing the mayor holding something, but not able to make it out clearly due to his inebriated state.\n\nJim gets closer, closer, and then mayor draws on him. He sobers up just long enough to realize he\u2019s got a bullet between his eyes.\n\n\u201c\u2026what the fuuuuuuuuck\u2026\u201d Jim says before falling face first on the floor.\n\n\u201cWow, that was pretty intense, I mean my own life was on the line there! Whew! But I figured you\u2019d kill Jim, too bad it wasn\u2019t the right choice on your part.\u201d You say punching the mayor in the face and take your pistol back, loading it again.\n\n\u201cStupid bastard, didn\u2019t it occur to you that I\u2019d do the same thing to your wife?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he says looking up at you with blood coming from his mouth, as your own curls cruelly upward.\n\u201cJust kidding, I wouldn\u2019t stick my dick anywhere near Jim has been. Looks like you made the right choice after all!\u201d\n\nYou put the mayor out of his misery and shoot him in the face. You then approach the mayor\u2019s wife who\u2019s still been rocking to herself this whole time. You look at her a little closer.\n\n\u201cHmm, you must\u2019ve been very beautiful before this all happened.\u201d You remark, caressing her damaged face, before ending her life as well.\n\nHaving had your fun, you go and announce you\u2019re the leader now. Unfortunately you don\u2019t quite have the charisma or imposing physique Jim had, so not everyone is willing to follow. (Ramon and Dan are among the first ones you kill for disobeying you) What ultimately happens is the town becomes a factional warzone where nobody is really in control and the poor Cinderville townsfolk are caught in the middle. Eventually things stabilize and a few of the \u201cheavy weights\u201d carve out their own territories and there\u2019s an unstable peace in the town. Fights still break out, but there\u2019s never an imbalance of power or advantage for long. (Though, maintaining a hold on the biofuel refinery gives you a little bit of an advantage\u2026)\n\nFour years pass\u2026\n\nFive years have passed since the bombs dropped and you couldn\u2019t be happier. You\u2019ve accomplished more than you ever did in the old world. World War Three was the best thing that ever happened to you. You\u2019ve been running your own slice of heaven in this hellish world and had the freedom to live out your true nature, which you\u2019ve done for the past five years.\n\nAnd now that freedom could be coming to an end.\n\nRecently through rumors and wandering travelers who have the misfortune of finding Cinderville, you\u2019ve found out that there\u2019s a growing organization trying to \u201ctame\u201d the wasteland. They call themselves The Combine. Apparently they\u2019re at war with another organization called the Cybernetic Collective and the Combine\u2019s been aggressively taking towns and conscripting the citizens to fight in their war. And now they\u2019ve come to Cinderville.\n\nThey arrive in well taken care of vehicles, with better training, better discipline and better weapons. They begin talking to everybody they can. They aren\u2019t going to take the entire town by force, no what they intend to do is to back one of the stronger factions to wipe out the rest, and then absorb their puppet into the Combine to have control over the entire town. You\u2019re not fooled.\n\nThe question just remains is; are you going to ally with them first, or fight this threat to your freedom?", "action_results": [{"action": "Ally with the Combine", "result": "If you have any motivation to keep your position, you\u2019ll have to ally with the Combine, for now at least. You decide to at least hear what they have to say. Two envoys come to speak to you; one of them is some rough looking man that probably thinks he\u2019s some sort of hard ass. The other is a woman, she looks like she\u2019s probably seen battle, but you\u2019re more interested in her seeing your dick up close and personal if that\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cSo, I hear you\u2019re one of the Warlords of this town. My name\u2019s Roger and this is Vivica. We belong to The Combine as I\u2019m sure you already know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I already know all about your little paramilitary outfit. Trying to tame the\nwasteland or some shit. Futile endeavor I say. It all comes down to chaos in the end. The last world war proved that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ve ran into your type before. Typical petty despot who thrives off of the suffering around you. Let me guess, you were probably a petty criminal or prisoner in your old life. A loser. Someone who never could accomplish anything, until AFTER the bombs hit. And look at you; you can\u2019t even do that right. You don\u2019t even control this whole town. You\u2019re still a loser.\u201d\n\nYou smile at Roger\u2019s poor attempt at psychology.\n\n\u201cOh, is that what I was eh? Well I guess that makes us both sides of the same coin. You were probably some boring fucktard in a boring job, with a boring life. You probably watched reality shows about cops and mercs an\u2019 shit wishing you could do that, but were too much of a sheep to go out and have adventures of your own. You just obeyed the laws and followed the rules. Now look at you. Mr. wasteland fuckin\u2019 warrior, but even in this new world you\u2019re still a fucking sheep. Still following the rules, the only reason you\u2019re having adventures now is because your superiors tell you to. You\u2019re just as much of a fucking loser as I am.\u201d\n\nRoger noticeably grows angry by your own psychological evaluation, but Vivica steps in to mediate.\n\n\u201cLook, you fuckers compare dick sizes later, we ain\u2019t got time for it right now.\u201d\n\u201cOoowee! I like the mouth on this one! I\u2019d like it more around my dick though\u2026you interested in seeing just what my dick size exactly is honey?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I suggest you better explain why the Combine should back you for control of this shithole town and what you\u2019d even bring to the table other than your miniscule cock you like flapping in the wind.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I need to convince you? You\u2019re the fuckers who want the damn town, but if you must know, I already have control of a biofuel refinery. I\u2019d say that puts me as a pretty good favorite right there.\u201d\n\u201cEh, not really. One would wonder why someone who has such an advantage doesn\u2019t already HAVE control of the entire town. It seems like only someone who is really stupid or too incompetent to lead his side to ultimate victory would be the only logical explanation.\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s just that simple to you huh? For your information I don\u2019t exactly HAVE the same amount of people as the other warlords. I have enough to defend my territory and that\u2019s about it and sure I can refuel all my vehicles easy enough, but so fuckin\u2019 what? You think that means shit in close urban combat? Some sniper can just blast a driver riding down the street. Don\u2019t mean shit. However! My refinery can be used to help fuel YOUR vehicles in your war with\u2026what those cyborgs right? I mean you guys are fighting in the open battlefield where you can maneuver and drive around. You can also transport supplies quicker. And I know why you also want control of this place. You want conscripts. Well, you\u2019ll get no protests from me; take anyone you want, except my workers at the refinery and myself of course.\u201d\n\nVivica and Roger look at each other and discuss in quiet about what you\u2019ve told them, Vivica speaks up again.\n\n\u201cAnd you would be willing to join the Combine and supply us with whatever we need?\u201d\n\u201cSure, like I said, take anyone you want except me or the people needed to run the refinery, of course I hope this isn\u2019t a one way street, I mean I want something too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course we will transport food and water supplies if you need\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No not that shit. Fuck, I got my own private stash of food and water. And the rest of the shitheads in this town can fend for themselves. Nah, what I want is right here in front of me\u2026\u201d you say beginning to leer at Vivica. Now she begins to feel very uncomfortable. Good. You like that.\n\n\n\u201cHold on we have to talk this over\u2026\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Vivica shouts.\n\u201cSure, sure, you do that. Just remember, this is my offer and I might say it\u2019s a very generous one, I doubt you\u2019ll get a better one. The rest of these warlords are greedy bastards, they\u2019ll want weapons, and a bunch of other shit. All I\u2019m asking for is for some time with a woman and your help with getting rid of the other warlords of course. After I gain control of the entire town, you\u2019ll be able to take whatever you want with no resistance. You want fuel? You got it. You want cannon fodder? You got that too. Decline my offer and well\u2026let\u2019s just say I\u2019ll make sure I do a lot of damage before you fine Combine folks bring me down. I\u2019ll leave you to it to decide.\u201d\n\nVivica and Roger leave your office and you can hear arguing outside. Obviously Vivica is NOT real keen on this compromise and she\u2019s even less keen when it\u2019s decided she needs to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d.\n\nYou fucking love this shit. How far people are willing to degrade themselves for the \u201cgreater good\u201d. What a fucking joke.\n\nLater that night, you and Vivica are ready to finalize the \u201cdeal\u201d, though she\u2019s still trying to maintain some semblance of dignity.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be pulling some kinda sick shit with me or hitting me either, because if that happens, I won\u2019t give a fuck about the deal, the Combine, or even if I live, but regardless of what happens, you\u2019ll be singing soprano, and pissing like a bitch for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nA threat without fear of consequence. Somehow you can respect that. Hell you think you might even be in love.\n\n\u201cOkay, calm down sweetheart, none of that\u2019s gonna happen. Now let\u2019s start off by getting that pretty mouth of yours in action like I mentioned earlier today\u2026\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Vivica grabs her clothes and leaves immediately. You\u2019re a little disappointed, since you almost got the impression she enjoyed herself\u2026oh well, back to business.\n\nWith the Combine\u2019s help, wiping out the other warlords is a snap. Indeed you could\u2019ve done it yourself long ago if you\u2019d had disciplined people and more of them. Of course none of that matters now, you\u2019re officially head of the town, though the Combine leave a few troops behind as a reminder that Cinderville is now part of it. They don\u2019t do too much though, and mostly leave you to your own devices. You\u2019re giving them free fuel, free conscripts, and even letting them use most of your remaining vehicles, and barely asking for anything in return, why shouldn\u2019t they let you do what you want? They\u2019re doing what they want. Besides they\u2019re busy at war with a bunch of cyborgs and you\u2019re so far away. They won\u2019t be interfering anytime soon.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nTen years have passed since the bombs dropped and civilization seems to be reforming\u2026unfortunately.\n\nThe Combine won the war with the Cybernetic Evolution a couple years ago and have had time to focus on their current holdings a lot more. This means they\u2019re focusing more on Cinderville, which you don\u2019t like. In fact more and more of a Combine influence is being felt. They\u2019re starting to supply the town regardless of what you said before. No longer are the people living in poverty and near starvation. By God, they\u2019re even trying to REBUILD parts of it! You don\u2019t like this.\n\nYou protest their meddling, but they don\u2019t pay any attention to you, Cinderville IS under Combine control after all. You\u2019re just there for looks and in fact you\u2019re not looking too good to them anymore. It seems the Combine wants to put one of their own in power here to run things. They don\u2019t need to compromise their ideology anymore now that the war\u2019s over.

Unforgivable really.\n\nYou\u2019ve lied.\nYou\u2019ve stole.\nYou\u2019ve tortured.\nYou\u2019ve betrayed.\nYou\u2019ve used people as slave labor.\nYou\u2019ve murdered countless people.\nYou\u2019ve killed children.\nYou\u2019ve raped women.\nYou\u2019ve orchestrated chaos.\nYou\u2019ve committed numerous atrocities and you did it mostly all for your own pleasure.\n\nAnd oddly you\u2019ve gotten away with all of it for the most part.\n\nWhy did you do any of it? You don\u2019t even know why anymore, you\u2019re just sorry that you did. You\u2019ve begun to have nightmares about some of the things you\u2019ve done. All the faces of your victims.\n\nIt\u2019s like it\u2019s all starting to finally catch up with you\u2026in more ways than one.\n\nYou wake up in a cold sweat from one of your nightmares one day, except this time you see something at the foot of your bed. Something familiar, but strangely appropriate.\n\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, everyone else stopped looking for you after you disappeared, but I knew if I continued my search, I\u2019d find you eventually.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that mutant bounty hunter you saw ten years ago. At this range he really does look like death personified. In fact, you don\u2019t think he\u2019s a mutant at all. For the first time in your life, you feel fear, but there\u2019s something very surreal about all of this.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here! The elevator doesn\u2019t work! I would\u2019ve heard you coming down!\u201d you say in disbelief.\n\u201cWell you were asleep, but it\u2019s amazing what you can block out of your mind, I think you know all about that don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026how did you find me?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from the past. Of course I think you know all about that too, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hallucinating! I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t there. I\u2019m sick!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the understatement of the decade. But you haven\u2019t been well in twenty years and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here now. I can make it all go away. Tried to do it ten years ago, but you weren\u2019t ready yet I guess.\u201d\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you. This\u2026being isn\u2019t here to punish you at all; he\u2019s here to release you. And it\u2019s finally welcome.\n\n\u201cWill you really make it all go away?\u201d you ask with a quiver in your voice.\n\u201cOf course, like I said that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cOh good, thank you!\u201d you begin to sob.\n\nThe pale being readies his weapon, but before he releases you, you still have some questions.\n\n\u201cWait, before you do it. Do you know why I did it?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you could.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. All those other reasons you might\u2019ve toyed with in the past were merely philosophical smoke screens to mask the truth from your mind. You did what you did, because you could. There is no deeper reason. The people who started World War three did it, because they could. None of it makes any sense, and any attempt to make sense of it, is meaningless. Your time here was meaningless. Whether you killed a bunch of people or you had saved a bunch of people, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Life and world would\u2019ve gone on regardless. You weren\u2019t special, you never were. And you know it, deep down inside you know it.\u201d\n\nFor the first time you finally see everything so clearly.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026you\u2019re right. I see that now.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m right\u2026so now are you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nYou sit up in your bed and close your eyes.

Good luck.\u201d\n\nAs you turn to leave the woman speaks again.\n\n\u201cHey wait! You mean you\u2019re not going to let us in? You\u2019d just leave us out here? We told you, we were low on gas! And now my husband Jonathan has a broken leg! How are we going to get by?\u201d\n\u201cSo, you can drive can\u2019t you? Look, this isn\u2019t my problem. I helped out, because I realized you guys weren\u2019t bandits or some shit, but I\u2019m not here to take care of you. I have my own concerns.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLet it go Doris, I guess we should be grateful he fixed my leg and didn\u2019t kill us.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going to be okay Dad?\u201d the boy asks, speaking up for the first time without yelling.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Tyler, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAh fuck, you started to give shit and now it\u2019s coming back at you.\n\nYou turn around, and give in.\n\n\u201cAlright, you can come in, but you\u2019re staying in the topside of the store, you can even stay until your leg heals, but after that, you gotta go. I don\u2019t have supplies to sustain all of you indefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe family is very grateful, and moves in immediately.\n\nOver the months you all get to know each other a little better though you still don\u2019t exactly tell them how you \u201cacquired\u201d this place. You just say your \u201cUncle Billy\u201d gave it to you when he died.\n\nSoon Jonathan\u2019s leg is much better, but you\u2019re wondering if you shouldn\u2019t let them stay on a more permanent basis; however as it turns out, that\u2019s exactly what Jonathan had in mind for his family except YOU weren\u2019t included.\n\nThis treachery for your good graces comes as a surprise one night, when Doris suddenly wakes you up by banging on the trap door, yelling about how she thinks there\u2019s someone out side and how Jonathan went to check, but she thinks he\u2019s in trouble. You immediately grab your shotgun and go see what\u2019s wrong.\n\nYou barely get out the front door, and you\u2019re suddenly hit in the head, knocking you to the ground. Jonathan grabs your shotgun and points it at you. Doris and Tyler come to the doorway.\n\n\u201cDoris, take Tyler down into the underground\u2026this\u2019ll be over soon I hope.\u201d Jonathan replies grimly.\n\nDoris nods and then looks at you, with a sad expression.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry about this\u2026we really are\u2026\u201d she says and then takes her son away leaving just you and Jonathan. You stand up and brush yourself off.\n\n\u201cSo, were you planning this all along or what?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I dunno\u2026nowadays, you don\u2019t really plan anything, it just sort of happens y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, I know.\u201d\n\u201cWell you can understand that this is a good place for me and my family, and I can\u2019t allow you to just kick us out.\u201d\n\u201cStupid bastard, I was just thinking about letting you all stay on a more permanent basis.\u201d you laugh. This response surprises Jonathan, and it almost looks like he\u2019s going to change his mind, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s too late now. You\u2019d never trust me now, and I\u2019d always think you\u2019d try to get revenge. You have to leave. Besides you said it yourself one time, there aren\u2019t an indefinite amount of supplies, to sustain all of us.\u201d\n\u201cWell you might as well pull that goddamn trigger John, because I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, man I\u2019m serious! I\u2019ll do it. I don\u2019t want to, but  I got a family to think about and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s gonna make me change my mind\u2026look I\u2019ll let you leave with some supplies. How about that? I mean you can take one of these vehicles or even mine! Just you gotta leave, we\u2019re taking this place now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s not much of a choice, but it may be more preferable than death.

He bellows in pain, and then you kick him in the face.\n\nYou pick up the shotgun and point it at him.\n\n\u201cYou stupid motherfucker! I woulda let you stay here! If you\u2019d just\u2026bah!

It\u2019s Tyler holding your pistol, silent, with tears in his eyes upon seeing his dead parents.\n\nYou give up, even if you had the strength to pick up your shotgun, you\u2019re not going to kill a kid. In fact you figure you probably deserve to die anyway given that you\u2019ve killed two couples now who didn\u2019t really deserve it. You decide to give some last minute advice to this newly orphaned lad, who\u2019s going to surely have a hard time of it now, but still he might survive if he listens to your words\u2026\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust anyone kid\u2026nobody.\u201d", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave", "result": "\u201cAlright, fine I\u2019ll leave\u2026but you know this isn\u2019t right.\u201d You say backing away.\n\u201c\u2026I know\u2026I know\u2026\u201d he replies.\n\nJonathan calls his wife to get you few days supply of water, and some food.

They tell you that maybe the town they stopped at before will be friendlier to you and you could try to live there.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything else, you just go to start up your van and drive off, you aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019re heading, but you figure you\u2019ll take the \u201cfriendly advice\u201d of Doris and Jonathan and go to the town they told you about.\n\n You get a few miles and then your van decides to die on you. Nothing\u2019s going your way. After futile attempts to fix it, kicks, and threats, you realize you\u2019re walking now, which wouldn\u2019t be completely bad if you weren\u2019t without some sort of weapon.\n\nWhile walking along the desolate road, a dog like creature appears in the distance, then another, then more. They look like wolves, but something is obviously different about them, like they\u2019re deformed in some way, either way they don\u2019t look friendly, but they do look very hungry.\n\nYou attempt to outrun them, but the mutant wolves are faster, and they ultimately catch you and rip you apart.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Head to the city", "result": "You have no real idea where to go so you head to the City.\n\nYou might live in the boonies, but you aren\u2019t an outdoorsman. You aren\u2019t some survivalist that\u2019s been training yourself for this \u201cmoment\u201d so it\u2019s not like you can just start living off the land, and unless the City was completely flattened by a nuclear bomb, you\u2019ll probably still find something there.\n\nAs for the radiation factor, you\u2019re probably receiving a lethal dose of radiation right now. It\u2019s not like you were so far away from blasts that you wouldn\u2019t be receiving it, though you try to think back to your Grandfather who was in the army and had to witness some nuclear test blasts back in the old days. He was certainly in the danger zone, and lived a fairly long time. One of the few though.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ve inherited that level of resistance, or at least that level of luck.\n\nBut unless you find food and water supplies you aren\u2019t going to be living long enough to die of the radiation.\n\n\nYou continue your drive to the city, watching the surroundings getting progressively worse looking, You then see the shattered \u201cskeletal\u201d remains of skyscrapers looming in the distance. The city got hit, but apparently by something \u201csmall\u201d and probably exploded high in the air. Of course that doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. You make a mental note of all the \u201cuseful\u201d locations you used to do your shopping. You goal is to go in and grab what you can to sustain you for a long time and leave for some place else.\n\nWhen you finally reach the city, it feels a little creepy. Everything seems so empty and dead. You have the windows up, but it\u2019s not like you wouldn\u2019t be able to hear noises if there were any, which there aren\u2019t. Just the silent remains of destroyed buildings and vehicle husks. You wonder if any people survived, though you\u2019re guessing if they did they won\u2019t be in great condition. In fact it\u2019s been a week since the attack; survivors might\u2019ve died by now without medical attention.\n\nYour first stop is the supermarket. You don\u2019t have high hopes of finding anything though. You know looting was going on in the city even before the bombs hit, still this IS the reason why you came here, so you enter through one of the big broken floor windows. No lighting inside of course, but the sunlight from outside is providing enough, plus you have your flashlight if you need it. The entire place has an unpleasant odor, but you\u2019re guessing it might be rotten food from the meat section and diary section, assuming those sections even have any of those items left.\n\nOddly you do find that the aisles aren\u2019t completely empty. Most of the canned food gone, but there\u2019s still a ton of cereal and nothing says you have to eat it with milk! Beef Jerky survives anything as well. You can\u2019t believe people didn\u2019t take that stuff. There are some soft drinks left in the now non-working freezers. Probably flat and warm as fuck, but again you hardly care at this point. You get yourself a hand basket and start loading up on what you can.\n\nWhen you get back to your van you finally hear something besides the crunch of debris underneath your own feet and the blowing wind. Its footsteps\u2026several of them.\n\nYou then see something you only thought existed in horror movies. These must be the bomb victims you though were dead by now, but it seems they\u2019re not dead, or at least you\u2019re guessing they\u2019re not. A group of them staggers towards youMany of them have a half-crazed appearance and severe radiation burns. Apparently their minds have damaged along with their bodies. Some of them are armed with blunt instruments.\n\nAs they approach you, they just looking at you menacingly and start growling, until one of them points at you and shouts in raspy voice.\n\n\u201cMEEEEEEAAAT!\u201d\n\u201cShit! Die motherfuckers!\u201d you shout back, shooting and quickly getting in your van as they hasten their pace towards you.\n\nYou manage to drive off, but not before they manage to smash your windshield and both of your side windows. You think you killed a few of them, you saw a few go down when you shot at them, and you know you ran that one over. Of course it\u2019s not like you hung around to see if they got back up, but you\u2019re pretty sure now they aren\u2019t reanimated corpses. Of course that doesn\u2019t make this situation any less fucked up or them any less dangerous, since they seemed intent on eating you. You need to get out of the City, but now what appeared previously empty, now appears to be more inhabited then you thought as more of these\u2026things come out of woodwork.\n\nYou haven\u2019t gotten far, when your van is bombarded by bricks and even fired upon! Some of those bullets hit the wheels causing you to skid out of control. You attempt to regain control of the van, but fail and smash into nearby building. Attempts to restart it also fail, though you don\u2019t have that much time anyway as some of these freaks are fast approaching on your position.\n\nYou get out of the van with your supply bag and start running. You don\u2019t even know where you are right now; you were in such a hurry to get the hell out that you didn\u2019t realize you took the wrong streets, now you\u2019re in unfamiliar territory and the fact that all the landmarks have been blown to shit doesn\u2019t help. Though this looks like some sort of industrial district. You duck into one of the warehouses hoping to lose the freaks.\n\nThe place has destroyed sections of the roof. Pallets and empty boxes of varying sizes lie all over the place. You look for someplace more secure to hide just in case, but all you can find that looks suitable is what looks to be a manager\u2019s office.\n\nWhen you enter, the office is also in disarray. You decide to wait here awhile to consider what to do next, during which time you inspect the various papers on the ground. You also remove the silly \u201cprotection wear\u201d, you\u2019re getting hot and it\u2019s not going to protect you from anything anyway.\n\nAfter scanning through many of the documents, most have the insignia of \u201cGZS\u201d on them or Ground Zero Survival, that corporation that was trying to sell people bomb shelters before the war. (One you still wish you bought right now) You didn\u2019t even know they had any holdings in the City. Looks like this place shipped a lot of equipment to said Shelters during their building process. No map locations though unfortunately, just a bunch of random shelter numbers. You end up kicking the desk in frustration only to succeed in hurting your foot, and making another discovery.\n\nWhen your foot moved the desk, you notice it was hiding a trapdoor! Though you wonder what the hell one is doing here. This seems a little weird, but then again the whole situation is weird, so you open it up and climb down.\n\nThe first thing you notice is what a long climb it is, the second thing you notice is there\u2019s lighting when you reach the bottom, dim, but lighting. The corridor leads to a heavy duty door not to far ahead, so you head that way, but when you go to open the door you find it locked. Before you can shoot the lock you hear a voice on the other side.\n\n\u201cLisa is that you?\u201d the voice says.", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell the truth", "result": "\u201cUh, no.\u201d you reply\n\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a survivor like you, I came to the City to get supplies, but I got attacked by some sort of mutant things or something, and I got temporarily trapped here.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha!

I don\u2019t care WHY you\u2019re here! All I know is; I got my ass chewed out by HQ for someone else\u2019s fuck ups! We got Shelters all over the goddamn tri-state area with mixed up equipment during the building process and we\u2019re only NOW just finding out about it! You know how BAD that makes us look to our customers? I got sent down here to see if I could find out anything and all I\u2019ve found out is the goddamn City is crawling with fucking cannibalistic mutants!

So open up the goddamn door and let me in!\u201d\n\nYour act and tone is very convincing of someone who\u2019s had to deal with red tape and silly corporate orders. (Though you do know something of them having had to deal with them at your own job in your \u201cold life\u201d) obviously the security guard knows about them as well, because he lets you in.\n\nWhen the door opens up, you see a surprisingly scrawny man. You were expecting someone a little more burly, but he still wields an assault rifle slung around his shoulder making the need for physical strength unnecessary.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you don\u2019t look like a GZS employee\u2026shouldn\u2019t you be in a suit and tie or something?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be running all over the nuclear wasteland in a hot ass suit and tie!

Some sort of generator sits in a corner giving off a low hum.\n\n\u201cI told you she\u2019s not here; she went to the surface again. She should be back soon.\u201d The security guard says still eyeing you suspiciously.\n\u201cAgain? Why\u2019s she going up there in the first place? Ain\u2019t nothing left up there.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. I went up once and nearly got myself killed. Since then Lisa says she\u2019d rather me stay guard here and not get in the way of here so called research.

I\u2019m really surprised you being from HQ that you don\u2019t know about it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I get BURIED in paperwork, and they don\u2019t tell me shit.

This is just a research outpost as it were. The real drug was made somewhere else, but it needed to be tested right? So they decided to test it here, a batch of it got dumped in the water supply months before the bombs hit. The idea is that the survivors of the initial blast would still be able to live and not get cancer, sterility or tumors and all that other bad shit that radiation causes. So even people caught in the cities would survive and be able to eventually rebuild and get civilization up and running again. I think they wanted to dump the drug into ALL the major cities, but it looks like world war three happened sooner than they though eh?\u201d\n\nWhat you just heard sounds like some sort of science fiction tale! Then again being the cynic you are, you can\u2019t say you\u2019re completely surprised by it. Though now you have a more important question.\n\n\u201cOkay, but if that was the intention\u2026what\u2019s with all the mutants in the City trying to eat me?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026well\u2026I guess it didn\u2019t work the way it should\u2019ve? That\u2019s sort of why Lisa and me were still here. Lisa was supposed to record the results of the drug after the bombs hit and that\u2019s what she\u2019s been doing. Lisa says the drugs are affecting people\u2019s minds, and combined with the already fucked up situation I\u2019d say it probably explains a lot already. Though I gotta say there was some pretty bad rioting even before the bombs dropped so I wonder if the drug was starting to affect the minds of people even then\u2026but that\u2019s silly I mean me and Lisa haven\u2019t been affected by it at all, I dunno.\u201d\n\u201cYOU and her drank the water too?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, our personal water recycling system has it. I mean if we were going to be here, we damn well had to be pretty resistant to radiation\u2026wait a minute I just realized something\u2026 you mean GZS sent you down here without this knowledge? Oh shit! You realize how many rads you\u2019ve probably soaked up without the drug\u2019s protection? Oh man, you were right! They must hate your guts at HQ! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sucks to be you!\u201d Owen laughs uncontrollably\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMan, I mean shit! They pretty much sent you to die!  I mean really why the hell would they worry about whether shelters got the right equipment shipments now for anyway? GZS already got their money, did you actually think they were going to go send someone personally to each shelter correct the mistakes? They were already built man! Use your head!\u201d\n\u201cUh huh, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! I mean damn, you work in shipping, GZS fucking up shouldn\u2019t even be news to you! Look at what happened with this goddamn anti-radiation drug! I mean what asshole fucking moron thought up those shelter elevator designs?\u201d\n\u201cWhy what\u2019s wrong with the elevator designs?\u201d you ask innocently, which suddenly puts Owen in a less jovial mood, he begins to get suspicious again.\n\n\u201cSomething ain\u2019t right here\u2026anyone who works for GZS knows how idiotic the computerized shelter elevator set up is. People got fired for that one. Why hell why do you think WE have a ladder? You claim you\u2019re from HQ and you don\u2019t know? I don\u2019t care HOW much you say you\u2019re out of the loop\u2026 I\u2019m a lowly security guard and even I heard about the fucked up elevator designs!\u201d\n\nOwen goes for his assault rifle slung on his shoulder, and you charge slamming him into the wall with an elbow to his face. You then pistol whip him a couple times before taking his rifle away from him. He holds on to his bloody face looking at you.\n\n\u201cUghhhh, shit\u2026my face\u2026\u201d he groans.\n\u201cOkay look, I was probably wrong for lying about working for GZS and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck you\u2026you goddamn piece of shit\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHEY! Asshole! I\u2019m the one with the gun here! Now I don\u2019t want to kill you, but\u2026\u201d\n\nOwen unsuccessfully tries to grab his rifle back, you kick him back down.\n\n\u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kiddin\u2019 me? I nearly shot you, dumb fuck! I\u2019d probably be able to kick your ass even without these guns, so you better just calm\u2026\u201d\n\nOwen once again attempts to attack you, this time you butt him with the rifle hard, and kick him out the door then lock it.\n\n\u201cFuck you then asshole! Let the mutants eat you!\u201d you shout, you expect to hear banging on the door, or even pleading, but you don\u2019t hear anything. After a few hours pass, you open up the door, and Owen is gone. You close the door back up and explore your surroundings a bit more.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to explore though, just two simple bedrooms, an eating area, bathroom and the \u201cliving area\u201d which you\u2019re already familiar with. The generator provides power, and a water recycling system provides water. Looks like there\u2019s some sort of food dispensing system as well, though what it dispenses isn\u2019t particularly tasty.

It didn\u2019t seem to do them any good, so you decide not to risk drinking any of the water or taking any with you. You also wonder about Owen\u2019s supervisor Lisa. He did say she was supposed to return soon, you form some ideas on how to handle the situation, but as it turns out, she never does. Probably got killed no doubt.\n\nThe next morning you leave. You half expect Owen to be waiting to ambush you, but he\u2019s completely gone. After making sure the coast is clear you get your bearings again, and make haste for leaving the City. Luckily you have no further encounters, and you\u2019re just a little bit safer for leaving the City of course now there\u2019s the problem of find another stretch of civilization, but you think you have enough supplies.\n\nA few days go by and you eventually do stumble upon a small town.

About a month passes and you feel tired all the time, you get the shakes pretty bad, and soon, you start vomiting blood, then there\u2019s the hair loss\u2026\n\nYou lie on the dirty bed in the house lamenting how ill prepared you really were for all this and the bad decisions you chose that made it worse.\n\nYou can\u2019t go on waiting for the end, you\u2019re in hell right now, and a quick death would be a welcome release. You get the idea to shoot yourself, but you\u2019re so weak now that you merely collapse when you try to reach for your pistol, however as it turns out your wish is shortly granted during this time when you also fall unconsciousness and lapse into a coma.\n\nDeath soon follows.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay", "result": "You decide to stay, and think about what Owen said about the water supply and the anti-radiation drugs in it then you think about what happened to a majority of the survivors.

You can\u2019t really do much about it now, but you\u2019re hoping that water can keep you from dying a slow horrible death, though you don\u2019t know how it works exactly since you weren\u2019t drinking it before you absorbed rads. Still, you\u2019ll try anything now.\n\nThe first thing you do is start drinking the water, and a lot of it. You also wonder about Owen\u2019s supervisor Lisa. He did say she was supposed to return soon, and you form some ideas on how to handle the situation when it arises (to keep your mind occupied), but as it turns out, she never does. Probably got killed no doubt.\n\nA few days go by and there\u2019s not much to do for entertainment purposes and you\u2019re reluctant to leave your \u201csafe haven\u201d now. There are some books in what is Lisa\u2019s room that you peruse through. You also look for maybe some notes on her research since the stuff Owen told you about did sound interesting. Maybe even ideas on what the drugs in the water supply might\u2019ve done to people (Something ELSE you\u2019re starting to worry about) but unfortunately you don\u2019t find anything. She must\u2019ve taken those with her. Owen\u2019s room has an old TV set which amusingly has an equally as old game console hooked up to it. You spend a lot of time shooting different colored circular objects with your white triangle on the screen.\n\nAfter a week you start feeling weird. Like mildly delirious. You start lying in bed a lot, only getting up to quench your thirst since you don\u2019t have much of an appetite.\n\nAfter a month you start feeling sick. You begin throwing up and having diarrhea even though you\u2019ve barely been eating anything. You have the shakes and you often just lie on the floor aching all over you body. You drink the water in the steadily failing hopes that it will miraculously cure you.\n\nWhen patches of your hair start falling out, and cough up bits of blood, you really start to lose all hope.\n\n\u201cOh fuck\u2026I don\u2019t wanna die like this\u2026shit\u2026\u201d you sob.\n\nYou begin thinking about suicide, but you\u2019re so weak that the one time you seriously attempt it; you collapse on the floor when reaching for your pistol and fall unconscious for a full day.\n\nWhen you wake up, you feel a little better physically, but not much. However your mind is a little warped. As it turns out this is somewhat fortunate as you don\u2019t worry about dying so much anymore. You do start talking to yourself at great lengths though. You begin having bizarre thoughts about things in general. Sometimes you go into a fit and start ranting until you\u2019re hoarse.\n\nAnother month passes and you\u2019re completely better physically, in fact you feel stronger than you ever did before. Your mind is still in la la land though. You begin to get very violent. You begin punching the walls (and even doing some damage to them) and ripping up books. What temporarily \u201csobers\u201d you up is when you smash the food dispenser, breaking it completely. While you still have real food left you\u2019ve just destroyed your only means of food-substitute when the real stuff runs out.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d you yell. \u201cI gotta get a fuckin\u2026grip\u2026I gotta get fuckin\u2019 food!\u201d\n\nYou grab your pistol and assault rifle and throw open the door in search of food.\n\nAfter climbing back up to the surface, you notice that you can see pretty well in the dark warehouse. It would appear you\u2019ve developed some minor \u201cdark vision\u201d. In the darkness you also notice that the warehouse has lots of rats and roaches crawling around in it.\n\nThose could be food\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Eat the rats and roaches", "result": "Something you wouldn\u2019t ever consider eating before suddenly makes a lot of sense to you. You start off by grabbing the nearest crawling roaches you see and start popping them in your mouth and chew.\n\nThey taste terrible, somehow though you don\u2019t suffer a gag reflex though. You just find them unpleasant, like eating something bitter rather than disgusting. After having had enough of eating bugs you try to catch a rat. It takes awhile, but eventually you stomp on one severely crippling it and then stomp once more to kill it.\n\nEating a raw rat doesn\u2019t particularly taste any better, but again you don\u2019t suffer any sort of natural revulsion during this act. It would seem you\u2019ve gone through a change of some sort, one that has put you in a better frame of mind for survival. One that has also put your body in better condition for survival as well since you suffer no ill effects from eating such unclean creatures under equally unclean conditions. You temporarily have some problems with lice and fleas you catch from the rats, but even that doesn\u2019t really become a problem considering the rest hair has fallen out now. (Well you have a few wisps left)  You skin also begins to harden in time, making fleas no longer a problem. Whatever internal parasites any of these might\u2019ve carried also have no effect as it seems your resistance and immunity system has increased quite a bit.\n\nYou look in the bathroom mirror one day and see that you\u2019ve changed alright. Changed into something better. You aren\u2019t going to win any beauty contests, but you\u2019re going to live\u2026\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve been living a relatively simple life of eating and sleeping and it\u2019s basically been enough. For the past year your mind hasn\u2019t really been the most stable, so you haven\u2019t really thought about anything other than your immediate survival, and given you have a water supply and the rats and roaches for food, you haven\u2019t ventured outside of the GZS warehouse since you entered.\n\nThat\u2019s starting to change.\n\nLately your mind seems to have a little more clarity. Indeed you\u2019re starting to feel like \u201cyourself\u201d before the change. Not entirely like yourself, but you don\u2019t go shithouse rat crazy screaming at the walls like you used to.\n\nYou\u2019ve been getting a little curious about the rest of the City. If you\u2019re mostly sane now, maybe other survivors are as well. Maybe even some things have been fixed; it would be nice if they were, as its getting boring where you\u2019re currently staying. Taking your weapons with you, you leave your new home to explore. (Making sure to hide the trapdoor before leaving of course)\n\nThe City streets are still as desolate as you remember them, and mostly empty as well. You expect to run into gangs of mutants though. You suddenly stop and think about that for a moment and realize that YOU are also a mutant now!\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mutantism is a club. You\u2019re sure there\u2019s a lot of fighting for resources. In fact you come across some fighting, though in a different way than you\u2019d imagine. While you\u2019re walking through a neighborhood by a corner store that has all its windows boarded up, you hear voices inside. You step through the open doorway to investigate. It\u2019s dark inside, but some candles light up the place.\n\n\u201cTed, what do you mean you won\u2019t gimme anything for this? This is a solid gold watch man!\u201d a skinny mutant asks an exceptionally ugly one eyed mutant he has pistol strapped to his side.\n\u201cGoddamn it Carl, would you fuckin\u2019 think? What the hell am I gonna do with a gold piece of shit that doesn\u2019t even work anymore in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cWell can\u2019t you trade it for something? I mean gold\u2019s gotta be worth something to someone! It\u2019s not like I gave you a sack of dollar bills!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t stop you from trying though did it? Look Carl, unless it\u2019s something useful you know damn well I ain\u2019t taking it. Bring back some batteries, a first aid kit, hell some canned corn would be a welcome change of pace than watery roach soup! Just stop bringing me shit I have no use for!\u201d\n\u201cBut Carl! I need some bullets! You can\u2019t expect me to do any scavenging downtown without bullets for my pistol! How will I defend myself against the Ferals or how about at night when the Shadow Horde comes out?\u201d\n\u201cCry me a river Carl, you\u2019re a fast guy I\u2019m sure you can outrun the roving gangs of Ferals, ain\u2019t that hard. And second of all you shouldn\u2019t even BE out at night! If you get caught out at night I got no sympathy for what happens to you! Now\u2026\u201d suddenly Ted\u2019s one good eye catches sight of you.\n\n\n\u201cWho the fuck are you pretty boy?\u201d Ted asks, Carl just backs off when he sees the assault rifle strapped to your back.\n\n\u201cPretty boy? Have you seen my face?\u201d you retort.\n\u201cYeah, I see your fucking face an\u2019 you\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 pretty boy as far as I\u2019m concerned. Shit you ain\u2019t even got any scars. So what the hell do you want, I ain\u2019t seen you before. Ain\u2019t seen too many here with an assault rifle either. You part of the Zeropolis Guard? Then again you don\u2019t wear the uniform\u2026maybe you just killed one of them then? Heh heh.\u201d\n\u201cWho are the Zeropolis Guard?\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t heard of them? Huh, well they\u2019ve only just been making scouting missions in this area. Basically a collection of ex-National Guardsmen that insisted on staying here to the very end. They got the best hardware as far as I know, but the delusional fuckers think it\u2019s STILL their job to keep peace in the damn City. Ain\u2019t no peace in Zeropolis!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Zeropolis exactly?\u201d you ask feeling completely out of the loop, which only gets you some mighty strange stares by Carl and Ted.\n\n\u201cUh, Zeropolis, y\u2019know\u2026The City? That\u2019s what this place is called now.\u201d Carl says.\n\u201cHoly shit pretty boy, you been livin\u2019 under a damn rock or something?\u201d\n\u201cWell, uh sort of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI guess so! Where the hell ARE you from?\n\u201cEr\u2026I never actually lived in the City...I guess you can kind of say I got trapped here and then shortly after went mad for a little while and I\u2019m only just now starting to feel like myself.\u201d You explain without giving too much information out.\n\u201cHmm, well that might explain some things. I think we all know about that madness you\u2019re speaking of. Think it happened to everyone after this place got nuked, still going on for most people. You get that hunger craving and violent thoughts pervade your mind\u2026though the first one I killed and ate was my wife so it wasn\u2019t ALL bad har har har!\u201d Ted laughs. \u201cHey how many people did you eat during that time?\u201d\n\u201cUh, none actually.\u201d\n\u201cNone? Ah, you must be like Carl here. He just ate roaches and rats because even when the madness hit him he still was a big pussy!\u201d\n\u201cFuck you Ted! I\u2019M the one going out risking my ass scavenging, not YOU! I\u2026just didn\u2019t want to eat anybody\u2026I guess I just never suffered the madness as much as the rest.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well anyway what do you guys actually sell here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell Carl doesn\u2019t sell shit, because he doesn\u2019t own this place, I do. And as you can probably tell we run on the barter system here that being the only real way to do business anymore. However I have a wide variety of items, but not obviously not right here, since this part of the store ain\u2019t the most secure as you can see, but bring me something I might find useful and maybe we can do business; just don\u2019t bring fuckin\u2019 broken gold watches!\u201d Ted exclaims looking back at Carl.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff downtown to scavenge, hey\u2026maybe you could come with me?\u201d Carl suddenly asks hopefully.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Carl", "result": "You don\u2019t really have anything better to do, and you are sort of interested in learning more about your surroundings. You are living here now after all.\n\n\u201cUh sure I\u2019ll go with you. What do I do exactly?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll go? Great! You don\u2019t really have to do too much really, I just need someone to help with the whole protection thing while I search, since Ted here is being a jackass and not giving me any bullets!\u201d\n\u201cHey those are in damn scarce supply in the first place! In fact, you better start finding them on your own soon, because I don\u2019t have too many to spare anymore anyway. I need something to defend my shop with. Here!\u201d Ted pulls out three bullets from his ragged pockets and gives them to Carl. \u201cThat\u2019s coming out anything you bring back too, and if you guys are going downtown, you better do it now, before nightfall. See you later.\u201d\n\nYou and Carl set off, while you\u2019re walking you notice other mutants wandering in the neighborhood, but they don\u2019t attack, in fact many of them are just watching the both of you or going about their business. (Like catching a rat to eat)\n\n\u201cSo is this area safe or something? Nobody\u2019s attacking us.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s safe, well safe as anything can be in this place. I mean there\u2019s still always the Ferals that roam around, but not so much around here anymore. The people around here in the Dust District don\u2019t even try to eat one another. Probably due to the fact that a lot of people used to live here and work together in the factory and warehouses nearby, so I guess there\u2019s that sense of unity as it were. Though I\u2019m sure most of them did attack each other at one time. Still, this is a severely new situation, you can\u2019t blame TOO much on what happened during people\u2019s madness. Weird what happened though, I mean do you think the enemy dropped some sort of nuclear nerve agent combo on this place? Or did we all just go temporarily insane in the face of the shear devastation?\u201d\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell you, Carl. Maybe the second one I guess.\u201d You say keeping your secret information on the reasons to yourself.\n\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t take much for us to fall apart I suppose. The Zeropolis Guard have also claimed they\u2019re going to make this place even safer when they set up a new base here, though I sort of wish they\u2019d just leave us alone. I get the impression they\u2019ll be trying to tell us all what to do and conscripting us to fight the Shadow Horde.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the Shadow Horde anyway?\u201d\n\u201cMan, you don\u2019t know who THEY are? Then again you didn\u2019t know the city name either! Anyway The Shadow Horde is a group of mutants who primarily live in the sewers, though they do come out at night and attack anyone who isn\u2019t part their group. They\u2019re sort of like the Ferals, except they are a lot more organized and even more vicious. I\u2019ve heard they have a leader of some sort; I\u2019ve only heard rumors though; ranging from a giant abomination, to a beautiful priestess of some sort. Have a hard time believing a lot of them, the only thing I do know is you don\u2019t want to get outside at night, let alone even enter the sewers!\u201d\n\nCarl continues to about various things of Zeropolis on your way Downtown. As fucked up as things are, you can\u2019t help but be fascinated by it all. You feel like you\u2019re actually living in some sort of 80s low budget post apocalyptic movie. You ask him if anyone actually leaves Zeropolis, but he says it\u2019s rare. The Ferals and other more territorial mutants seem content on staying in the City, and as for the other \u201cnormal\u201d ones, it\u2019s happened, but it seems mutation isn\u2019t a common theme outside Zeropolis. Most mutants are shot on sight or at least chased off. At least those are the stories he\u2019s heard from a couple of people he knows that have left only to come back.\n\nThe closer you get to Downtown the more Carl stops talking only telling you to keep a look out and to be quiet. Lots of Ferals fight each other in the Downtown area and will obviously attack anyone else. Plus there are other scavengers here that will try to bushwhack each other as well. Carl pulls out a large bag and you and he start going into various devastated buildings where he grabs things of varying interest.\n\nA few instance you see large groups of Ferals in the street, but Carl tells you not to fire, since they\u2019re all fighting each other at the time. Another instance when you\u2019re on the second floor of an apartment store, another mutant clobbers Carl with a lead pipe and tries to make off with the bag of goodies, but a couple of shots put the thief down.\n\n\u201cThanks. Oh fuck, I think the shots caught the attention of the Ferals outside, we better get out of here!\u201d\n\nYou and Carl rush out the building and after you fire a few more shots at the Ferals you both make a beeline back the Dust District, unfortunately you and Carl have to retreat and backtrack several times to avoid large groups of Ferals, until finally when you get out of the area, its twilight and you still haven\u2019t gotten back to the Dust District yet.\n\nYou and Carl hear a nearby sewer manhole opening up\u2026\n\n\n\u201cOh shit we\u2019re gonna die!\u201d Carl yells and starts running. He\u2019s in such a hurry to getaway he trips and dumps his bag with all the contents inside! He frantically starts putting everything back in, but already you can see the Shadow Horde starting to come out, and yeah they do look a hell of a lot meaner than the typical Ferals, which is pretty hard to do. The fact that they start shouting\n\n\u201cCARL GET YOUR ASS UP, WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!\u201d you yell and start blasting Horde members with your assault rifle, picking your shots, but when they fire back, you can\u2019t stand your ground for long and run leaving Carl behind.\n\nYou hear Carl trying to catch up with you, but you soon hear more shots, yell of pain followed by the collapsing of a body. You turn around to see one of the Horde trying to finish Carl off with a spiked bat, but he blasts the mutant in the head with his pistol twice killing it. He\u2019s wounded and even if you went back to get him, the rest of the Horde is closing in and you\u2019d never outrun them if you carried Carl on your back.\n\nSensing the end is near; Carl uses his last bullet to save himself a torturous death by the hands of the Horde. Of course now you have worry about yourself.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue a straight forward run", "result": "No time for fancy shit, you just have to RUN! You run and don\u2019t look back, though you can still hear them chasing you, and other Horde members start popping out of other sewer gratings.\n\nEventually you get to the Dust District, but they\u2019re still chasing you, that\u2019s when you hear shouting coming from in front and above you as well.\n\n\u201cALRIGHT START THROWING AND FIRING!\u201d\n\nSuddenly from up high bottles crash to the ground releasing gouts of fire. Molotovs. Next comes the sounds and flash of machine gun fire from everywhere.\n\n\u201cOH SHIT!\u201d you shout and duck down and roll into a nearby building. The Horde was still chasing you, but most of them got burned by the Molotovs, the shrieking is unnatural sounding, but it\u2019s soon put to an end when the flaming flailing bodies are shot by the machine guns. After it\u2019s all over you pick yourself up only to get kicked in the ribs and a rifle shoved in your face.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 move Shadow scum!\u201d a uniformed mutant orders.\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSilence!\u201d another kick, this time to the nuts. While you hold your crotch in pain, another uniformed mutant arrives, but this one has a higher rank.\n\n\u201cAlright Private, that\u2019ll do for now, let\u2019s see what this fucker has to say about his buddies\u2026what the fuck? This ain\u2019t no Shadow! He\u2019s too fuckin\u2019 pretty for one thing, and not nearly muscular enough.\u201d\n\u201c(Groan) I\u2019m not, I live in this area! I was scavenging Downtown with another and we got caught after dark\u2026he\u2019s dead.\u201d You say picking yourself up.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s usually what happens. Woulda happened to you too had we not set up base here in the Dust District. This place will be completely safe from now on as it is officially under direct protection by the Zeropolis Guard. I\u2019m Captain Salazar.\u201d\n\nWell that explains the uniforms.\n\n\u201c\u2026yeah I heard of you guys. I also heard you only had scouts in the area though.\u201d\n\u201cWell we move fast, and we needed a new base camp. Our last position was steadily being overrun by Ferals during the day and the Shadow Horde at night. But I think here is a good position to make a stand. This area doesn\u2019t have as many sewer entrances, Feral activity is low, and best of all there\u2019s the abandoned factory and plant nearby. Maybe one day we can power up the entire City again, but for right now we\u2019re trying to just get power to this district, though even that will take awhile. The Zeropolis Guard is dedicated to bringing order to this city and I think this is the best place to start.\u201d\n\u201cHey that\u2019s great, okay I\u2019ve had a hard day; I think I\u2019ll just go home now\u2026\u201d\n\nCaptain Salazar suddenly stops you.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re free to go back home citizen, I can\u2019t help but notice your weapons\u2026now while I certainly understand the need for personal protection, especially given this unstable situation and your current choice of profession, so you may keep your pistol. However, your assault rifle would be of great use to us. We need all the maximum firepower we can get to better defend this area.\u201d\n\u201cWell it doesn\u2019t have many bullets left though.\u201d You say, but Salazar merely smiles at your attempt to keep your rifle. The private who kicked you looks at you like he\u2019s anxious for you to try something.\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright; we have plenty of ammo suitable for it. However, if you wish to actively join the Zeropolis Guard, then you certainly would have need for such a weapon\u2026 do you wish to join?\u201d\n\u201cUh no. That\u2019s okay.\u201d You say helplessly handing over you weapon. Salazar takes it.\n\u201cPity, you seem like you\u2019d make an excellent solider. Still, our offer is always open and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to easily find us. You may return to your home.\u201d\n\nYou make you way back home, in fact you\u2019ll be really glad to get home, today wasn\u2019t very fun, reminds you of why you always preferred your own company. You sort of wonder though about how things might change with the Guard messing around in the area. While this warehouse is sort of in an isolated part of the Dust District, you can only imagine that it\u2019s a matter of time before the Guard start snooping around here and given you have a generator and water recycler, they\u2019ll probably want this place for themselves and you\u2019d have to go live in one of the crappy neighborhoods like everyone else.\n\nOf course you might be able to swing things to your benefit if you did join the Zeropolis Guard, though that might mean they\u2019ll be sending you on missions where you can get yourself killed.\n\nBefore you fall asleep, you think about the future and how you\u2019re going to deal with this situation.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the Zeropolis Guard", "result": "You see where this is going; the Zeropolis Guard is fully intent on their delusional plan and they\u2019re going to be the top assholes in this area, so you might as well join them to reap the benefits. It\u2019s better than being at their complete mercy and it\u2019s certainly better than living in fear of the Shadow Horde, at least the Guard seems to want to restore order.\n\nThe next day you go find Captain Salazar who is pretty easy to find since he\u2019s currently giving speeches in the streets to the Dust District inhabitants of how they should actively join the Zeropolis Guard. Not too many takers, but none of them are in any position to argue with the occupation. When you go up to Salazar to tell him you\u2019re interested in joining, he\u2019s pleased to just have someone taking him up on his offer.\n\nOf course he wants to know more about you and where you\u2019re currently staying, and you do tell him about the warehouse, just not about the secret GZS rooms underneath. He\u2019s a little bewildered of why you\u2019re staying there rather than a proper house in one of the neighborhoods, or even your own house. To this you reply that you used to live in one of the Downtown apartments, and couldn\u2019t live there anymore due to the danger. You mention during your time of madness you ended up wandering this way and just took up residence there and now even though you\u2019re better, you\u2019ve made it your home and feel comfortable at that place. You also go on to say that you prefer to be away from large crowds of people.\n\nCaptain Salazar frowns at that last statement.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know we are a military unit, teamwork is encouraged here\u2026though I suppose we need all the help we can get right now, so I guess you\u2019ll be on scouting duty. Maybe if you prove yourself, I\u2019ll put you on sniper duty. As for your living arrangements\u2026I guess you can stay there. That area is pretty empty and there isn\u2019t anything there except a few warehouses, we\u2019re more interested in the plant and factory. However it\u2019s the perfect place where the Shadow Horde might stage a sneak attack from due to its remoteness. So consider yourself the sentry in that area. I wish we could use our radios, but the radiation levels here\u2026well are sort of screwing up the signals. We\u2019ve been trying to train messenger rats, but so far the little furry bastards just run off to the nearest source of food, so you\u2019ll be reporting to me personally every two days where I\u2019ll either give you new instructions or tell you to continue what you\u2019re doing. Unless I hear otherwise and you don\u2019t report, I\u2019ll give you one more day and then I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re either dead or have deserted. If you\u2019re dead then you\u2019re dead, but if I find out you\u2019ve deserted, my wrath will be terrible, and you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but what if I was captured?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! You\u2019re joking right? Not really much of a chance of that happening. Ferals just kill, and the Shadow Horde might capture you, but they won\u2019t let you live afterwards. I trust you won\u2019t let yourself get captured then right?\u201d\n\u201cGuess not.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s see, what can you do\u2026I got everyone else working on other things, right now we\u2019re tracking down all the sewer manholes in the area and shoving the remains of cars on top of them. Others have been sent to raid nearby police stations in the hopes of finding more weapons and ammo. Okay what you\u2019ll be doing is scouting and clearing out the factory; we\u2019ve discovered that all the Feral activity in the area has been coming from those places. At least that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen them all run off to, you can go retrieve your assault rifle seeing as I haven\u2019t given it to anyone else yet.\u201d\n\u201cAm I working by myself, or with others?\u201d\n\u201cWell from the impression of getting, you\u2019d probably prefer working alone, but that\u2019s simply too dangerous for what I\u2019m sending you in to do, you\u2019ll need someone watching your back, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with Private Ackman here\u2026\u201d\n\nYou then see the soldier who kicked you yesterday. He doesn\u2019t look any friendlier and just nods at you.\n\n\u201cThere will be other small detachments exploring various parts of the factory as well so more ground can be covered, but for the most part you two are on your own. Dimissed.\u201d\n\nYou and Ackman go carry out the mission in relative silence. Private Ackman doesn\u2019t seem to care for you, or at best he doesn\u2019t want talk to you unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. This doesn\u2019t really bother you though since he is a good fighter, and is making this mission a lot easier. The factory is a huge place though even in its current devastated state; there are several sections, multiple levels and it covers a lot of land. It\u2019s going to take awhile.\n\nAfter a few months of factory clearing you and Ackman have the highest Feral body count so far, and their attacks on the Dust District are becoming non-existent. Due to this accomplishment, many of the inhabitants have a little more confidence in the Zeropolis Guard and as a result more people have volunteer to help, either by joining directly or by attempting to fix the power plant. Shadow Horde attacks occur sometimes, but even those aren\u2019t as frequent. Zeropolis is a big place, and presumably they\u2019ve turned their attention to easier areas.\n\nFour years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since you set foot in Zeropolis, and the place has changed quite a bit, well in your area anyway.\n\nMost of the factory has been safely stripped to help rebuild the district. The nearby plant has parts of it fixed and partial electricity has been restored to the district as well. Feral attacks are completely unheard of in the area now, they\u2019ve either all been killed, or in a few cases, managed to retain their sanity again.\n\nThe Zeropolis Guard has firm control of the area and has been attempting to restore a few old vehicles to work again mainly using jury-rigged steam engines, though the many stills created to make hooch certainly serve the same purpose to create \u201cGarbage fuel\u201d as it were for vehicles. Oddly one thing that has surprised everyone is that new mutants are actually being born! Not many, but it still came as a surprise when one of the female mutants found out she was pregnant, when it was assumed everyone would\u2019ve been sterile due to the radiation, but then again the fact that you\u2019re all still alive is proving that you\u2019re all working on a different biological level now.\n\nYou\u2019ve risen in rank with your superior sniping skills, and saving others you\u2019ve effectively become second in command. You\u2019re looked upon as sort of a \u201chero\u201d figure among the Dust District.\n\nThe Shadow Horde is still around, but attacks have less frequent. This perpetual war with them is basically at a standstill. The Zeropolis Guard has many more resources, but not nearly enough people. Captain Salazar is irritated by this fact, but there\u2019s not much he can do about it. His big idea of bringing order to the entire City is slowly being crushed as he realizes this might never be possible. In desperation he\u2019s sent a few people OUT of Zeropolis in the hopes of somehow getting help, but so far all his efforts have resulted in failure. People don\u2019t like or trust mutant, and it\u2019s mainly due to another organization attempting to \u201ctame the wasteland\u201d known as The Combine. With most of the outside towns under their control, they\u2019ve developed \u201ca shoot mutants from the City on sight\u201d policy. Salazar\u2019s behavior which was at one time just pleasantly dedicated is now becoming obsessively totalitarian.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re standing by your warehouse home one day when you see some outsiders visit Zeropolis. They aren\u2019t entirely human though, they look like cyborgs. Which would explain why they have no rad suits.\n\nThere have been reports of The Combine currently at war with their own enemy called the Cybernetic Evolution. You\u2019re not sure what it\u2019s all about, but you\u2019re guessing they probably see themselves as superior to humans. (You\u2019ve seen enough movies in the past to know that\u2019s always the case!)\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019d be doing here, unless they intend on proving themselves superior to mutants as well. There aren\u2019t many of them, but most of them are heavily armed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Open fire immediately", "result": "The Cybernetic Evolution\u2019s opinion of mutants probably isn\u2019t much better than their opinion of humans. This is probably a scouting force to assess the defenses and resistance level here, well to hell with that you aren\u2019t going to let them report shit. You immediately open fire. You kill the smaller one in the center with relative ease, but the others go into battle mode and start laying down the firepower. You nearly get yourself killed before managing to take cover.\n\n\nOther mutants hear the sounds of battle and rush to the area to help you, and soon the metal interlopers are a pile of sparking scrap.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell, you find new enemies for us?\u201d one of the mutants asks you.\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be having any more problems with them. They\u2019re busy with a war with the Combine; I doubt an army of cyborgs will be coming here anytime soon. Better go report this to the Captain though.\u201d\n\nSoon after the cyborg diversion a lot of rumors start flying around that the Cybernetic Evolution will be attempting to invade Zeropolis or even that they\u2019ve somehow allied with the Shadow Horde, but none of these rumors even come true. Though it does make Captain Salazar paranoid enough to take the current war with the Shadow Horde more on the offensive, of course this doesn\u2019t pan out too well.\n\nWhen Salazar starts sending troops into the actual sewers they\u2019re at a severe disadvantage and the losses on your side are terrible, yet the Captain insists on carrying out this plan.\n\nA few years go by and the Dust District\u2019s defenses are nearly completely destroyed. You\u2019re one of last defenders left and the Zeropolis Guard no longer exists as you know it. After Captain Salazar was struck down by an assassin the organization dissolved and it just became a bunch of armed mutants trying to defend their homes.\n\nIt\u2019s a futile endeavor though the Shadow Horde is relentless and as much as you might hate it, you have to leave; it\u2019s just simply not safe to stay where you are anymore. The question is where to go?\n\nThere are probably other places in the City where the Shadow Horde isn\u2019t as strong or even in control, but that might just be a temporary solution and it might not be any safer.

Though in time, it begins to get dangerous once again as the Shadow Horde turns its attention to other parts of the City, and you have to move again, you continue this routine for a few more years until one day your luck runs out and you fail to leave in time and you finally become a victim to the ever growing Shadow Horde.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave the City", "result": "Going to another part of Zeropolis really isn\u2019t going to help.

You\u2019re a mutant, but you aren\u2019t exceptionally mutated to such a degree that you couldn\u2019t pass yourself as one with a disguise. You immediately start searching through old Zeropolis Guard equipment, when you find a gas mask you think \u201cPefect.\u201d\n\nYou also get some gloves and hooded cloaked, basically clothing that will completely hide your body and face. When you look in a broken mirror you are confident that not many would think you weren\u2019t human unless they insisted you take off your mask.\n\nAfter gathering what other supplies you think you\u2019ll need you leave Zeropolis. You\u2019re not sure where you\u2019re going to go though, you do know you\u2019ll have to keep moving to avoid suspicion in human towns and given the Combine only just recently won its war against the Cybernetic Evolution, its troops might be on a heightened state of distrust.\n\nHowever the world is a big place and this is just a small section of it, who\u2019s to say mutants are shot on sight everywhere? Hell maybe there\u2019s even a place where there isn\u2019t killing going on every five seconds.

Uh, hello! This is Zeropolis Guard territory! What do you want?\u201d you call out to the group of cyborgs. One of them briefly talks to its heavier armed brethren and then steps forward to meet you; it\u2019s a female, mostly human looking cyborg. She\u2019s sort of cute, well cuter than what you\u2019re used to around here anyway.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, greetings. I am AVA-93, former human remade, emissary prototype, from the Cybernetic Evolution.\u201d She says unemotionally.\n\u201cPrototype?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am one of a kind. The Cybernetic Evolution typically does not believe in wasting time with words. We prefer a more direct course of action as we are attempting to remake humanity to a higher state of evolution.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026so what purpose do you serve then since you guys tend to shoot first and ask questions later?\u201d\n\u201cWhy to make contact with you mutants of course. The Cybernetic Evolution is currently at war with a human organization called the Combine. They refuse to see the light, are a committed foe and greatly outnumber us. So we must find every means available to defeat them. We have heard that mutants are victims of human prejudices and that you are typically shot on sight when found outside the City.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose you could say that, though I can sort of see why they might be suspicious of us, many of us aren\u2019t exactly friendly types.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have heard that most mutants are completely hostile, I am surprised to see the amount of organization you have shown as I thought this was not the case.\u201d\n\u201cAround here, we\u2019re the exception rather than the norm, so what did you have in mind?\u201d\n\u201cAn alliance of course. We would like you to help us destroy The Combine.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, hold on there. I\u2019m not exactly in charge of this place; you\u2019ll have to talk with Captain Salazar, as he runs the Zeropolis Guard. There\u2019s also the fact that we\u2019re in a war ourselves with a group of mutants that outnumber us, we wouldn\u2019t be able to help much. Then there\u2019s the whole fact\u2026\u201d\n\nYou hesitate, but AVA-93 demands that you continue.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWell there\u2019s that fact that if you\u2019re trying remake humans into cyborgs, what happens after you defeat all the humans? Will you try to remake us as well?\u201d\n\u201cA thoughtful question. At the present time, you mutants are not suitable candidates for remaking, though what the future holds is unknown. However you can be rest assured that if we ally we will never attack you as long as we are at war with The Combine.\u201d\n\nThat answer doesn\u2019t really make you want to suddenly be their friend, though it was an honest answer. The only thing you can think of is let Captain Salazar decide how he wants to handle this, so you take AVA and the rest to see him.\n\nDuring the talks Salazar doesn\u2019t seem very concerned about what might happen in the future so much as what an alliance can do for him now. AVA mentions that they can supply him with their own high tech weapons to help in the war with the Shadow Horde, if the Zeropolis Guard starts raiding nearby Combine towns. He immediately agrees, and AVA leaves explaining that the first shipment will arrive as soon in the mean time they want an attack launched on the Combine immediately.\n\nYou advise strongly against this course of action. The Shadow Horde hasn\u2019t even been attacking in large groups like it once did. You don\u2019t like the idea of fighting a two front war and spreading your strength so thin, and you still don\u2019t like the idea of allying with a bunch of cyborgs with a superiority complex. Salazar doesn\u2019t want to hear it though; his vendetta against the Shadow Horde is too great. He wants them gone and is willing to do anything for the chance. In fact he\u2019s pissed off at you for advising against it, so he says he\u2019s sending YOU along with a few others to start attacking the Combine towns!\n\nYou leave Zeropolis for the first time in five years; it\u2019s very odd to you. Everything seems different, like cleaner. Even the air seems fresher. You almost feel like you don\u2019t belong here anymore, the others traveling with you feel the same way. Soon you approach a nearby town; of course you stay away for awhile plotting of how to approach this situation.\n\nOver the course of a few months you organize successful raids on Combine towns, mostly at night, taking advantage of your night vision. (Which seems perfect at this point)\nWhile you do feel superior to them, you don\u2019t have any particular hatred for humans; this is just job to you, nothing more. You don\u2019t have too much resistance for the most part. Most of the Combine force is holding off the Cybernetic Evolution. But you do lose people under your command, some through the attacks, but some due to being called back to Zeropolis. Apparently the Captain is having a lot more difficulty than he thought when he started sending troops down into the sewers to take the fight to the Shadow Horde. Eventually you\u2019re all by yourself! In fact you\u2019re wondering why Captain Salazar hasn\u2019t called you back since you\u2019re his second in command, you know he was pissed at you, but if he\u2019s calling everyone else back, why not you?\n\nAt this point you can\u2019t even really do too much, except maybe hang out in the wilderness sniping the occasional Combine citizen or soldier. In fact given this situation, you get the feeling he\u2019s pretty much abandoned you.\n\nMaybe you should just leave. It\u2019s not like you couldn\u2019t survive out here. Your time in Zeropolis has made you better in everyway. You could even withstand long periods of food and water if need be. (Though lately you\u2019ve been eating the mutant wildlife and drinking their blood to sustain you, so it isn\u2019t really a problem)", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait awhile", "result": "You figure you\u2019ll give it some time; you\u2019re not in a hurry to go anywhere.\n\nA week later and you wake up to a little mutant getting ready to push you to see if you\u2019re awake, you immediately wake before he can do anything, slam him to the ground and put your knife to his throat.\n\n\u201cHey! Stop! I\u2019m on your side!\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cOh? What the hell are you doing here? Did the Captain finally decide to send me some help again?\u201d\n\u201cThe Captain\u2019s dead!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fuckin\u2019 dead?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! He got assassinated by some big ass motherfucker! Anyway that\u2019s why I was sent to get you! You\u2019re next in line to take charge.\u201d\n\u201cWow. I would\u2019ve thought someone would\u2019ve just taken power themselves and left me to rot out here.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think a couple of people had that idea\u2026but then they realized the job wasn\u2019t worth it. The Shadow Horde has been taking the offensive ever since Captain Salazar insisted on pursuing them in their sewers. We need a leader to get us out of this mess and you\u2019re the only one we have!\u201d\n\nSee you knew no good was going to come of this.\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see how much shit we\u2019re in\u2026\u201d\n\nYou make your way back to Zeropolis and the Dust District is showing signs of battle, which is difficult to do since the place was a wreck to begin with. Dead bodies are being moved out of the street and the people look hopeful that you can somehow get them out of this mess.\n\nFirst thing you do is order a complete pull out of the sewers and reinforce your defenses in the Dust District. There\u2019s no point in pursuing an enemy that\u2019s lived in the damn sewers for years and knows them like the backs of their hands. Right now you need to regroup after the losses Salazar has incurred due to his recklessness.\n\nSecond thing you do is order no more attacks on Combine towns, you can\u2019t afford the man power and you didn\u2019t like allying with the Cybernetic Evolution anyway. However, another shipment of weapons was already on its way when you enact this order. The cyborgs who arrive wonder why they haven\u2019t heard any reports of mutants attacking the Combine. Seeing that this alliance is over anyway. You immediately have the cyborgs killed (Which is easier than you thought it would be) and keep the weapons to help your own struggle.\n\nA couple more cyborgs arrive a month later probably to investigate what happened to their fellows, and you have them killed as well. Your hope is that the CE will think they\u2019re losing them to Combine ambushes and will eventually just forget about you. And apparently they do because no more cyborgs are sent. You just hope the CE doesn\u2019t win against The Combine.\n\nEventually you manage to restore relative safety to the Dust District, its not safe like it once was though, but at least it isn\u2019t on the brink of disaster due to Salazar\u2019s mad plan. Being in charge isn\u2019t exactly a fun job, and its obvious why to as why nobody wanted to do it. Still the people see you as a savior of sorts and generally like you as a leader.\n\nThe warehouse that you live in, has been converted into the new head quarters, though you still live in the secret underground part that only you have access to\u2026well at least you thought you did.\n\nOne night you wake up in your room to a very pale woman by your bed. Obviously she\u2019s a mutant, but she\u2019s somehow managed to avoid the ugliness and scaring that goes along with it, though she does have part of her face covered. She holds a pistol, but seems to be inspecting the place more than paying any attention to you.\n\n\n\u201cBoy this was so long ago and another life time\u2026please don\u2019t go for your gun, I\u2019m here to talk\u2026my, you are a pretty one. Almost human looking\u2026almost.\u201d she says finally paying attention to you.\n\u201cHow the hell did you get past the guards?\u201d you answer calculating how quickly you might be able to reach her before she can get off a shot.\n\u201cThis war between our respective groups has taken a toll on both of us for quite sometime\u2026I would ask that we finally have peace.\u201d She says ignoring your question.\n\nYou gather she\u2019s from the Shadow Horde, though you\u2019ve never seen one like her. She\u2019s not brimming with muscles or trying to rip your head off for one thing. (And somehow she actually smells nice and unsewer like!) She is exuding a weird aura though, like you have a great desire to follow whatever she says. It\u2019s difficult to shake off these effects, but you try to keep a level head.\n\n\u201cPeace? You\u2019re ones always coming out at night to eat people! We were just trying to defend ourselves!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes I have come to understand that now\u2026and I appreciate your desire to exist. You have held out against us for years and accomplished much within that time. However I would say that your most recent attack on us was most definitely equally as brutal. You came into our sewers\u2026our home and murdered innocent women and children, decreasing the ranks of our future warriors and birth givers. You came in using weapons of unparalleled power and destruction, unleashing blinding rays of light, incinerating at a touch.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well like I said, YOU started it\u2026however that recent attack wasn\u2019t my idea. I thought we shouldn\u2019t spread ourselves out so thin.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of that, your Captain Salazar is dead and you have taken his place, which is why I feel I can talk to you about coming to you about putting an end to this conflict once and for all. I know of your deeds and you seem to be a lot more rational and reasonable than your predecessor. Anyway, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this conflict is only going to harm us in the long run. We have to think about the future. The future of mutant kind relies on us no longer fighting each other. I thought survival of the fittest was enough when I first embraced my evolution, I believed that only the strong should be allowed to rule\u2026but now I see that isn\u2019t enough if we wish to thrive, we have to unite.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, you know that we\u2019re the next stage of evolution. Humanity is the past, we\u2019re the future.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, I think I know some cyborgs that feel the same way.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes your cybernetic allies who you temporarily allied with, only to ruthlessly back stab later. Obviously they aren\u2019t the future if they needed your help to defeat some humans. Listen to me, this City just isn\u2019t divided between the Zeropolis Guard and the Shadow Horde you know\u2026there are other factions. You just never come on conflict with them because you\u2019re sectioned off in one corner of the City constantly fighting us and never able to spread out effectively. All these factions fight each other and that\u2019s not counting the Ferals. I\u2019m proposing that we could take the first steps in truly uniting Zeropolis. We could first approach in friendship, and if that regrettably failed, we could take by force. Who could stop us? The Shadow Horde has a higher birth rate and the numbers, while the Zeropolis Guard has the resources. You\u2019d attack on the surface and we could attack from below. We could rebuild the world in our image.\u201d\n\nThis rant is followed by her putting down her pistol, climbing on to your bed and seductively crawling closer to you, while taking off her strange protective mask revealing that the rest of her face isn't all scarred or mutated either. You feel really compelled to give in to her, and it\u2019s not just the fact that it\u2019s been awhile since you\u2019ve been with a \u201chuman looking\u201d chick. It\u2019s whatever aura she\u2019s exuding. It must be some sort of weird mutant ability she developed, but even though you\u2019re aware of it, that doesn\u2019t make it any less likely for you to want to resist. She\u2019s making a point you haven\u2019t considered before\u2026you\u2019re in a position of power, why not use it effectively?\n\nHer face is an inch away from yours and the only thing you can sputter is\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m known as the Queen by the Horde, but you can call me Lisa.\u201d She replies before kissing you passionately.", "action_results": [{"action": "Give in", "result": "You have no desire to resist her advances and you totally give in to consummate this new alliance in a very special way\u2026\n\nAfterwards you and Lisa get to know one another a little better. It\u2019s funny that she finally returned to the GZS research outpost after all these years. At the time you were kicking Owen\u2019s ass to take refuge here, she was attacked and nearly killed by Ferals and had to hide for several days struggling to survive. She mentions how she nearly died, how she got sick, how she came to accept the changes in her body, and how she managed to unite the sewer dwelling mutants.\n\nYou and Lisa talk about how you do both feel a sense of superiority to humanity, though it would seem Lisa has felt this way for a lot longer than you have and has stronger feelings about it, whereas you never really thought about it until you were actually killing Combine members. Indeed she does have a stronger feeling of only the strong should survive mindset, though that might be due to the harder path she had when trying to survive during those first few years.\n\nYou and Lisa begin to make plans for unifying Zeropolis. It isn\u2019t widely accepted at first, as there are hard feelings on both sides. Your side is willing to stop the fighting, but their a little leery of an alliance. However, your standing is good so you don\u2019t suffer outright rebellion, just a lot of grumbling. Lisa\u2019s side is even less receptive; you honestly don\u2019t know how she manages to keep those big hideous freaks in line even if she does have mutant pheromones and a strong force of will. As it turns out, the Shadow Horde for the first time splits and bickers among itself. Lisa manages to keep control of most of it, but not without an underground civil war.\n\nAfter all the smoke clears, the Shadow Horde and the Zeropolis Guard (Which you\u2019ve renamed the Zeropolis Legion) maintain a shaky alliance.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nTen years have passed since you decided that going to the City would be a great place to find supplies\u2026\n\nUnification of Zeropolis has been going as planned, but its still slow going. Most of the Ferals still alive have managed to overcome their relentless need for violence and food, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are any nicer. The Shadow Horde has more success with those types as great display of strength, intimidation and fear work well. On your end you\u2019ve managed to employ more peaceful means of incorporating the less hostile groups of mutants, such as restoring power to their areas and rebuilding. (The messenger rat system for long range communication even works well now)\n\nYou and Lisa could be considered \u201ctogether\u201d but it\u2019s a distant relationship. She runs her part, you run your part and every now and then you get together. She has some sort of feelings for you, but she\u2019s very much in her own world sometimes. Though the same could be said for you, but you do have feelings for her as well.\n\nLisa has also had your child. (Predictably 9 months after your \u201cagreement\u201d to the alliance.) A son, though you don\u2019t get to see him too much, mainly because Lisa wants him to be closer to her. In fact you get the impression one of the reasons she had sex with you was in order to have a fairly \u201cnormal\u201d looking child. She called him Adonis. It would seem that for all her talk on mutant supremacy, she still holds the \u201chuman\u201d standard of beauty in high regard, (though to be honest so do you!)  She\u2019s already training him to be self-sufficient with minor \u201ctests\u201d she sets up in the sewers; however despite this rather harsh training Lisa is very protective of Adonis.\n\nThe main faction standing in the way is one that has somehow gained momentum relatively recently over the last few years. A cult of mutants called the Glow Children, have taken over a great portion of Zeropolis through their weird faith. They follow a leader calling themselves the Savior. In your experience, groups with any type of religious faith behind them are never willing to negotiate and they aren\u2019t an exception. They are utterly fanatical and devoted to their cause. They also engage in attacks from the sewers as well, causing you to believe that ex-Shadow Horde members fill their ranks. They\u2019ve made their headquarters (or Cathedral as it were) at the old hospital.\n\nYou and Lisa are supposed to meet tonight with the rest of your respective cabinet tonight to determine how to best approach the Glow Children problem. You\u2019re walking out of your headquarters with your guards when from out of the street a very very LARGE creature appears with the biggest fucking gun you\u2019ve ever seen. Its resemblance to humanity is superficial even by Shadow Horde standards. You haven\u2019t seen ANYTHING like this before.\n\n\n\u201cGoddamn it Lisa what the fuck are your people doing!? You\u2019re supposed to be defending that area!\u201d you yell to yourself ducking back inside your headquarters and lying flat. The creature\u2019s weapon rips through the door and the walls, killing many of your men. You hear gun fire outside followed by screams.\n\nYou know damn well it\u2019s probably going to laugh at normal weapons so you run to grab those old CE weapons you haven\u2019t used since the Alliance. Time to use those plasma guns again.\n\nThe creature breaks through the remaining bit of wall ignoring the bullets flying into its back, a Shadow Horde member presumably coming from the sewers jumps on it and stabs it in the head, but the giant aberration only grabs him and breaks his neck with a squeeze of his own enormous hand and throws the lifeless body through the nearby wall. You\u2019ve never seen a Shadow Horde member treated like such a mere annoyance, and for once in a long time you really are scared.\n\nYou grab a plasma gun while the creature is still preoccupied with your guards doing their best to bring it down and that\u2019s when you fire a hot bolt of plasma into its massive body, again, again, and again, until the damn weapon overheats and burns your hands, causing you drop it. Fortunately you\u2019ve melted enough of its internal anatomy to cause it to finally collapse and die.\n\n\u201cAlright what the fuck IS that thing?!\u201d you shout wincing from the pain in your hands.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fucking big ass freak, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d One your men says. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Horde member do you? You think they\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, shit I hope not. Besides I just saw it kill a Horde member with its bare hands like it was nothing, never seen that before. Might\u2019ve been an Ex-horde member at one time though.\u201d\n\nAnother one of your soldiers comes in through the hole in the wall and has more news for you.\n\n\u201cJust got word from one of the horde, they got a similar attack on their Queen. Don\u2019t worry though, she\u2019s alive and so is your son. She said she\u2019ll be arriving soon.\u201d\n\nThat relieves you on several levels; you were sort of worried about them even if you all aren\u2019t exactly a proper family unit. You and some of the others inspect the body of the fallen creature. Damn thing is huge, but what disturbs you more is the fact you\u2019re seeing cybernetic implants\u2026not to mention its weapon is pretty high tech stuff, similar to the same ones you received from the Cybernetic Evolution\u2026\n\n\u201cOh shit, we got cyborg mutants.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat? But how? I mean\u2026last we heard The Combine won that war. Just barely, but they won.\u201d One of your soldiers replies.\n\u201cYeah, well it looks like there were survivors and they probably want revenge on us and what better way of doing that then by helping our enemies? (Sigh) the only good thing is that they can\u2019t possibly be able to have access to a lot of this high tech stuff anymore; they don\u2019t even have the means of manufacturing it since we own the factories. They\u2019re probably just using scraps and pieces they managed to take with them after the beat down they suffered from the hands of the Combine.\u201d\n\nThough those \u201cscraps and pieces\u201d can still do a lot of damage, and that\u2019s not even counting the regular fanatical cultists. You\u2019ll really have to get this attack plan with Lisa organized quickly. Suddenly you hear MORE sounds of battle! The Glow Children have sent more of their suicidal attackers to wreak havoc in your territory, most likely attempting to get to you though. Your guards suggest you descend down into you private quarters for protection, until Lisa arrives.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait in your quarters", "result": "It won\u2019t do anyone any good if you\u2019re dead so you decide to follow your guards\u2019 advice and enter your quarters. Should at least be safe down there.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what you think. When you enter your living area, you\u2019re immediately attacked by another hidden assassin! He stabs you several times before you throw him off of you. You weakly pull your pistol and blast the mutant cultist several times, but he absolutely refuses to die!\n\n\u201cFOR THE SAVIOR!\u201d he screams and finishes you off by shoving his knife in your throat, before he dies.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay where you are", "result": "As much as you probably regret getting yourself into this mess by EVER returning to the City, you are a leader now and you\u2019re determined to continue to act as such.\n\nSometimes you wonder what would\u2019ve happened had you bought that bomb shelter\u2026\n\nYou stay and demand to be informed on the current situation so you can position the defenses better. You want double security on the borders. You also order that all non-combatants should stay in their homes.\n\nWhen Lisa arrives she has Adonis with her, as well as her own retinue of guards. After telling a couple of your men to take Adonis to your quarters and look after him, you and Lisa begin to talk in your half ruined warehouse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting attack from all sides here you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo have we, the ex-members that broke off from my Horde have been leading many of these attacks at least as far as the sewers are concerned.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well we got bigger problems, have you noticed some of the firepower a few of these Glow Children are packing?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the same type that you used against us five years ago. Some of my people are starting to think that this is some complex ZL plot to wipe us out again, I\u2019ve had to alleviate those concerns though I can\u2019t say it didn\u2019t cross my mind.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I nearly got wasted by that colossus lying on the floor over there! And as you said your own ex-disgruntled employees are leading a lot of the attacks so don\u2019t think the same thoughts of treachery haven\u2019t gone through our mind up here as well!\u201d\n\u201cFunny that you should think that about us since we don\u2019t have the history of betraying our allies\u2026\u201d\n\nAn argument about accusations breaks out until gunfire from your quarters is heard.\n\n\u201cAdonis!\u201d Lisa says stopping her ranting at you.\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d you say and run to the ladder with everyone else not far behind.\n\nWhen you get to your quarters, you see a dead mutant cultist lying on the floor with multiple gunshot wounds, one of your men lies dead with multiple stab wounds and happily Adonis is still alive with one of your guards breathing hard. Adonis immediately runs to Lisa when he sees her.\n\n\u201cWhew! That motherfucker did NOT want to die!\u201d he says.\n\nAfter thanking the soldier profusely, you make a check wondering how the fuck the assassin got in, the only one who ever got through the door before was Lisa and that was because she managed to subdue your guards and had prior knowledge of the place.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you see a hole in the wall in one of the bedrooms, that hole now leads to the sewers. Knowing damn well that Lisa would make it known that harm should NEVER come to Adonis, any theories that the Shadow Horde is somehow behind things are out of your mind. Lisa\u2019s speculations for you are squashed as well.\n\n\u201cSee, the enemy is trying to sew the seeds of mistrust. The old divide and conquer, well to hell with that, they fucked up big time with this clumsy assassination attempt. That\u2019s it we\u2019re mobilizing every fucking thing we got, we\u2019re pooling our resources and\u2026\u201d\n\nYou get another report while in the middle of your speech.\n\n\u201cSIR! THEY\u2019RE ATTACKING DOWNTOWN!\u201d a soldier shouts from the upstairs.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d you exclaim and rush to the scene.\n\nWhen you arrive cultists are throwing home made bombs all over the damn place, some of them are purposely blowing themselves up.\n\n\u201cAim for the goddamn explosives on their chests before they get close!\u201d you order, while you engage in your own fighting from afar with your rifle. They\u2019re coming like swarms of lemmings though and the body count is growing, monstrosities like the one that tried to kill you earlier are proving cover fire for the gibbering suicide cultists.\n\nYou need to get into a better position to do the maximum amount of damage, so you look for higher ground while Lisa directs from the street level. You enter one of the buildings and begin running up the stairs to get to the roof. In the process of the excitement, you notice something.\n\n\u201cDamn, I used to work in this building.\u201d\n\nAfter this brief thought of the past you make it to the roof, where upon you\u2019re kicked in the face as soon as you exit the door, dropping your rifle.\n\n\u201cGood! I\u2019m glad you avoided the assassins, I was hoping to finish you off myself.\u201d\n\nAs you stand up, you see a nasty looking creature, with a hideous appearance.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for what you did to me, YOU turned me into this! With your lies and your assault! I was NORMAL until YOU came and ripped me from my protective sanctuary!\u201d\n\nYou immediately know who this is.\n\n\u201cOwen?\u201d\n\u201cSilence! I\u2019m the High Priest! Owen DIED when you threw me into the blasted City! Do you know how much pain and sickness I suffered? How many years I wandered the streets of Zeropolis little more than an intelligent Feral? You realize how long it took me to get over the madness?\u201d\n\u201cWell from where I\u2019m standing I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite over it.\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re wrong, quite wrong, when the Savior came, she brought clarity to us all. She will bring true order to this City, not the Horde and not the Legion, but the Children! For the Children ARE the future!\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026and you say you got over the madness?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think! What matters is you\u2019re going to pay for ALL your lies and treachery tonight! To me AND the Savior! YAAAAGH!\u201d\n\nOwen attacks you, which you narrowly dodge and trip him to the ground, he rolls out of the way and jumps back up.\n\n\u201cOwen, you really want to continue this exercise in futility?\u201d\n\nOwen attacks you again at which point you punch him in the face followed by a kick to his nuts. While he crumples to the ground you retrieve your rifle.\n\n\u201cAlright Owen, you know what happened last time\u2026and trust me I WILL be shooting if you attack again, now what are the defenses of the Savior at the\u2026\u201d\n\nOwen pathetically tries to grab the rifle from you, at which point you blast him in the head splattering his brains and skull all over the roof.\n\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d\n\nYou grab Owen\u2019s corpse and throw it on to the street battle below. His body lands in a bloody broken heap before some of the Glow Children. Upon seeing one of their top leaders dead, this is a great blow to their morale.\n\n\u201cYEAH, THAT\u2019S ONE OF YOUR LEADERS DOWN, NOW GO TELL THE FUCKIN\u2019 SAVIOR SHE\u2019S NEXT!\u201d you shout and begin sniping the ones in retreat.\n\nAfter attempting to mop up the stragglers, the general report is that the Glow Children greatly expended a lot of their manpower in this last attack. It\u2019s odd; it\u2019s almost as if this \u201cSavior\u201d doesn\u2019t really care about controlling the city at all, just destruction.\n\nLisa suggests an attack be made immediately before they can put up a suitable defense, she\u2019s still upset about Adonis nearly being killed, but you\u2019d like to at least regroup and mount an organized attack.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack now", "result": "Lisa\u2019s emotions might be running high, but it does make some sense to attack now. You order a full push to the hospital and not to stop until everyone of the Glow Children are dead along with their Savior.\n\nThe battle to the hospital lasts a couple days mainly because your forces aren\u2019t in a cohesive attack group, you\u2019re getting reinforcements, but it would\u2019ve been more efficient regroup first and come at the GC with some sort of battle plan rather than relentlessly throwing troops into the fray until you break through.\n\nBy the time you get to the hospital, that\u2019s where you meet the last stand of the Glow Children, and it\u2019s also where their battle elite are. The last cybernetically enhanced mutants come out in force and begin mowing down the Alliance troops at an alarming rate, you have order a retreat.\n\nDuring this retreat, one of those giant battle monsters that tried to assassinate you a few days ago targets its weapons on you and mortally wounds you. You lie on the ground and lift your head up long enough to see both of your legs have been blown off and your guts are hanging out. The creature now stomps in your direction ready to finish you off.\n\nYou sure hope Lisa can finish this war by herself, because it\u2019s over for you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Regroup", "result": "\u201cWe need to get our shit together first, look, we got people all over the damn place and wounded everywhere.\u201d You say surveying the damage.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!

What I\u2019m saying is we need to organize here, and not just throw people at them until something happens! I understand that\u2019s the Shadow Horde way of doing things but\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Lisa slaps you, and while your skin is tough, it still manages to sting.\n\n\u201cOh fuck you; if it hadn\u2019t been for YOUR duplicity we wouldn\u2019t even BE in this situation!\u201d\n\u201cLook Lisa, we NEED to at least regroup. I\u2019m sure that hospital is going to be their last stand and we can\u2019t go in attacking half assed. We need to attack from all sides and cut off all avenues of escape so we don\u2019t have to deal with guerilla hold outs after the main attack is over. We want to kill them ALL in one fell swoop; we don\u2019t want the fucking Savior to escape to cause trouble later!\u201d\n\nAfter a little more debate, Lisa finally agrees and you quickly gather your troops and implement a plan while Lisa takes care of her own end of things. Within a couple days you\u2019re ready, but Lisa still being strong willed sort she is, jumps the gun and begins before you.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it Lisa\u2026\u201d\n\nThe battle to the hospital is a slaughter on the Glow Children\u2019s side. They still haven\u2019t recovered from the battle of Downtown and they\u2019ve been losing many to the Shadow Horde. The Zeropolis Legion doesn\u2019t lose too many troops, though the Shadow Horde is taking a beating due to the fact that they\u2019re taking the brunt of the Glow Children\u2019s hospital defenses. That needn\u2019t had been the case had Lisa not attacked so soon. By the time you make it to the hospital most of the heavy fighting has been done. Dead bodies of both Glow Children and the Shadow Horde are littering the streets. Lisa stands outside the hospital seemingly unconcerned.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck Lisa? I told you to fuckin\u2019 wait! You look like you lost your whole goddamn Horde trying to storm this hospital!\u201d\n\u201cWho cares? If they aren\u2019t strong enough to survive then they can die like the rest. They\u2019re meant to serve me anyway, and the Glow Children MUST pay for what they nearly did to my son, no matter what the costs. Now go in and PROVE you\u2019re a father by doing what needs to be done. Should be easy\u2026I did most of the work for you.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head trying to reason with Lisa\u2019s recent volatile emotions, and head into the hospital with your own people. Sounds of battle are heard and body parts are all over the place. After a few shoot outs with the few wretched hold outs, you eventually track down the infamous Savior. Yet another old face that looks a lot different from when you last saw it.\n\nA severely burned female cyborg attempting to fix up one of her Glow Children on an operating table throws her scalpel down in frustration when she realizes nothing more can be done and sees you enter the room.\n\n\u201cMutants! Fucking goddamn back stabbing mutants\u2026you\u2019re no good for anything!\u201d she shouts.\n\u201cWow, AVA that\u2019s a lot of emotion for a cyborg.\u201d You say calmly.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how emotionless you remain when you see YOUR future destroyed before your eyes. This is all your fault! YOU caused all this! You did this to me!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ve been getting that line from everyone lately. It\u2019s getting old.\u201d\n\u201cFool. We would\u2019ve brought unity to the world; mutants would\u2019ve been incorporated too. All you had to do was help, but instead you betrayed us to those who hate you!\u201d\n\u201cYeah and that incorporation would\u2019ve been the total loss of free will I\u2019m sure. No thanks, I\u2019d rather take my chances with some disjointed puny humans than an army of unified cyborgs.\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course. You mutants think YOU are fit to rule the world. Huh. You\u2019re little better than humans. You still act on emotion rather than clarity. Look at your wife\u2026she sacrificed hundreds of her own people who she claimed she looked after all for a mere child. Don\u2019t look so surprised that I know about that act of total illogic, I could hear her screaming her rants of vengeance when I first saw her approach the hospital with her mutant rabble.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all she\u2019s not my wife. And what about what you did? Are you saying sending in multitudes of brainwashed mutants was so different?\u201d\n\u201dYES! Yes it was! My purpose was NOT based on emotion! I was trying to kill as many as mutants as possible! I had a clear goal! A clarity of purpose! What do I care what mutants died on who\u2019s side? I am not one of them!\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah. Well sounds pretty emotional to me. Sounds like good ol\u2019 fashioned revenge. And I suppose those assassination attempts on me was just business to eh? Nothing personal?\u201d\n\nAVA shakes her head in dismay and looks up at the ceiling. Tears stream from her non-cybernetic eye.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never understand mutant\u2026it\u2026it should\u2019ve been us\u2026we\u2026I\u2019m sorry Alex\u2026I\u2019m sorry my father\u2026I have ended up like you\u2026trapped and surrounded by my enemies with only death awaiting me\u2026forgive me\u2026\u201d\n\nStrangely, you almost feel sorry for AVA, putting her out of her misery is probably an act of kindness at this point. And so you do with a couple of well placed bullets.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Well AVA, if it\u2019s any consolation, you did a lot of damage to us, a lot of damage\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen you exit, Lisa is still waiting outside, she looks like she\u2019s deep in thought.\n\n\u201cYeah, the Savior\u2019s dead and from what I can tell so are all the other Glow Children as well as most of your Shadow Horde\u2026\u201d you say to Lisa\n\u201cGiven the temporary mistrust both side had for each other, perhaps its for the best\u2026perhaps this alliance needs to be dissolved and simply unified under one banner, one name, we are all mutants, no one is better than another, but we are all better than humans.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019re you saying exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying we should be joined officially\u2026with this latest annoyance out of the way, Zeropolis will soon be under our total control and then it will be time to handle the humans. I\u2019m already a Queen, and you shall be my King and Adonis\u2026shall be a Prince\u2026heir to our new mutant dynasty.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little surprised by this sudden suggestion\n\n\u201cWhoa! What the hell? You want us to get fuckin\u2019 married?\u201d\n\u201cYes, do you not have feelings for me?\u201d\n\u201cWell uh\u2026yeah I guess\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAm I not the mother of your son?\u201d\n\u201cWell of course.\u201d\n\u201cDo you not see the wisdom in this action?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled\u2026and be honest wouldn\u2019t you like to be able to spend more time with your son? Spend more time with me\u2026and be closer to you\u2026\u201d\n\nLisa\u2019s manages to convince you in that way she does through her seductive embraces and strong commanding will. You swear she has some sort of mutant ability to control minds.\n\nA festive wedding is soon held after the celebration of the Glow Children\u2019s destruction.\n\nTen years pass\u2026\n\nTwenty years have passed and the unification of Zeropolis is complete. One City of unified mutants and you are their KING. What was once a warehouse has now been turned into a palace.\n\nWar against the humans is also in full swing. Lisa made sure that was the first thing on the agenda the moment Zeropolis was completely unified. The Combine wasn\u2019t even prepared for the first few attacks, as entire towns were taken over with relative ease. Never before had mutants been so organized, and are now the greatest threats to them since the Cybernetic Evolution, worse even, since you can breed, and not just with other mutants\u2026\n\nThe Combine and The Zero Dominion (That being its new name) fought for a long time, but The Combine lost mainly due to its own internal turmoil. After a couple years of your attacks the government collapsed and splintered into several factions. Some of those factions willingly surrendered to you. Human traitors were not unheard mainly because rule under The Combine was little better. It was a corrupt and decadent organization that bullied its citizens, while human subjects living under your occupation are treated fairly well as long as they know their place and they are certainly well protected from other humans like the outlaw scum who lurk in the wastelands. With the Combine completely destroyed, mutants now rule everything within the area ranging from towns to even the Ground Zero Shelters still containing their inhabitants. (Actually many of those genuinely thanked you for releasing them from those underground coffins! Lisa of course wasn\u2019t surprised by the shoddy workmanship that went into most of them given that she used to work for the corporation)\n\nNow eyes of conquest look ever further, but despite all this, you\u2019re a relatively benevolent dictator.\n\nThough Lisa often thinks you\u2019re too lenient on the humans, and claims you must set a better example for Adonis who shall take over from you one day. Adonis is only a teenager, but has the arrogance of a god. The tests and training Lisa insists that he engage in continue, and have produced a superior specimen of mutanthood thus far. Already he is eager to shed the blood of humans, you sometimes have to tell him that he shouldn\u2019t let something like that dominate his thoughts as it can lead to recklessness, but he\u2019s very much like his mother despite the fact that you\u2019ve had regular contact with him now.\n\nYour daughter Venus on the other hand is different. She\u2019s still young, but even now you can see that she will be a very dissimilar person than her brother. While you\u2019d think Lisa would want to spend time with her own daughter, she still concentrates only on Adonis. Leaving you to take up that role, but even that is only minimal as Venus often prefers spending time by herself. She reminds you of\u2026well you. Over the recent years, you\u2019ve often wished you could spend time by yourself like you used to, but that\u2019s a rare luxury nowadays\u2026\n\nBut heavy is the head that wears the crown and you have a host of concerns as of late to attend to and they only stack up. Hell, you don\u2019t even know where to begin anymore. You begin to wonder if any of this is even worth it. You know you\u2019re better than humans, but is constant ongoing warfare REALLY what you want?", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue the war", "result": "You think back to when you first entered Zeropolis and how you hoped that you\u2019d somehow be as lucky or as radiation resistant as your grandfather was when he witnessed nuclear blast tests back when he was in the army. As it turns out you were, well lucky that is, the radiation resistance came later.\n\nDuring your entire stay in Zeropolis, you\u2019ve always tried to do what you thought was best for you, but many times you\u2019ve felt like you were railroaded into this path, and indeed sometimes you had little choice in some of your major decisions.\n\nHowever, ultimately they were your choices and even you have to admit you\u2019ve done far better than you could\u2019ve expected. Lisa\u2019s a better wife than you really could\u2019ve hoped for before the bombs turned the world into nuclear ash, let alone after the bombs. You son Adonis is obviously going to be a fine ruler someday, he certainly has all the necessary traits and if Venus is as much like you as she appears to be, she\u2019ll do just fine. Their future is what\u2019s important, and as such you have come to the realization that making sure they have a great empire to rule is the best thing you can give them. Not just for them, but for their children as well. You finally understand Lisa\u2019s dedication to conquest and why she\u2019s always pushed you to be a little more enthusiastic about it.\n\nSure she gets a bit intense as far as the human thing sometimes, but that\u2019s just part of her personality. You never quite understood why she\u2019s exactly so obsessed on the whole mutant superiority thing (Whereas you just take it for granted that you\u2019re better and just leave it at that) especially given that she herself has never even had contact with another one since her transformation. (You have though, one thing that always seem to get her hot is when you recount your time when you were doing raids on Combine town during your alliance with the Cybernetic Evolution) You\u2019ve always had a strange sort of relationship with Lisa, but it is love though, a weird form of it, but love nonetheless.\n\nPeople have been fighting wars and taking shit from others since the beginning of time, and from what you can tell they\u2019re still doing it. All for various reasons. So your reasons are for love and family. There\u2019s certainly more selfish and worse reasons.\n\nAfter coming to this epiphany you finally have eliminated any lingering doubts and reservations about anything you\u2019ve ever done or will do in the future. You immediately go find Lisa who\u2019s watching Adonis train against one of the few former Shadow Horde mutants left. He\u2019s managed to take the giant down with his bare hands too, not many can make that boast, let alone at the young age he has. When you arrive in the gym, Lisa approaches you.\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t expect to see you until tonight. I know how you like to spend long periods of time by yourself\u2026 I always found that strange for someone in a position of leadership.\u201d\n\u201cNot really Lisa, people who rule are often isolated, however I have come to the realization that I\u2019m not alone. The future of our dynasty is important, I see that now and I\u2019m going to ensure what we\u2019ve built doesn\u2019t end.\u201d\n\nYou think it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen overwhelming joy in Lisa\u2019s face, but she immediately hugs and kisses you. You think this is also the first time you\u2019ve actually heard her say \u201cI love you.\u201d to you. Adonis stops his training and wonders what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s when you turn your attention to him and point your finger directly at him.\n\n\u201cAnd YOU, you will be the next ruler! But if you want ANY chance of it, you\u2019re going to have to beat the me first!\u201d\n\u201cHah! You\u2019re kidding right? I just beat an Ex-Shadow Horde mutant with my bare hands! I can easily take you on old man!\u201d he laughs.\n\u201cThink so? Show me what all your training has done then, don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll go easy on you, wouldn\u2019t want to mess up that pretty face of yours, you sure you\u2019re not my daughter?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going down old man!\u201d\n\u201cNot likely, now stop talking and hiding behind your mother\u2019s skirt, mama\u2019s boy!\u201d\n\nThat one had the desired effect.\n\nUnsurprisingly your minor taunts make Adonis angry causing him to charge at you hard and you immediately drop to the ground and trip him. When he falls on his face you grab his arm and twist it behind him while putting your knee in his back.\n\n\u201cSee? You let yourself get too emotional and it threw off your game. You need to learn more about fighting than just the basics. I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll teach you that. Now get up.\u201d\n\nFrom that point on you take a more active role in training Adonis. Particularly in the more psychological and strategic aspects of it. He learns quickly, and in time learns to reign in the arrogance and some of his mother\u2019s views on humans, but he always retains his desire to fight. In the years to follow he joins the Dominion army and quickly rises through the ranks. Lisa is very proud and you are as well.\n\nAs for Venus, she of course remains her usual quiet self, though she does surprise everyone when she later joins the Dominion army as well, as a scout though. She turns out to be an excellent sniper.\n\nAs always there is resistance, but for the most part the Zero Dominion only grows larger under your rule.\n\n\nThirty years pass\u2026\n\nFifty years have gone by since you first set foot in Zeropolis and you\u2019re eternally glad you did. It could\u2019ve only been destiny that guided you to what you thought was most likely a death zone, only to turn out to be the place where you would achieve greatness.\n\nYou remember how humans used to shoot mutants on sight mainly to discourage them from venturing far from Zeropolis, but now mutants now control a vast portion of territory, their population has grown much much larger, and half-breed mutants from humans are in large numbers as well. A new era is being ushered in for a newly evolved being that will eventually replace humanity.\n\nNever did you think that you\u2019d actually live long enough to die peacefully in your own bed. But that\u2019s what is occurring now, you feel the approach of death occurring and you have no regrets. Right now you\u2019re surrounded by your family. Lisa, Adonis, Venus and their children as well. You can die knowing that you\u2019ve made the world a better place for them.\n\nYou\u2019ve made all of this happen and as you pass your throne to Adonis, while holding on to Lisa\u2019s hand who sits by the side of the bed, you say your last words:\n\n\u201cI love you all and finish what I started, my children \u2026\u201d", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stop it", "result": "You don\u2019t really want this, you never really did. You feel like every decision you\u2019ve ever made has either because you had no choice or because you felt influenced in some way. Well you\u2019re in charge now and if you don\u2019t want to wage an ongoing war with humans then you\u2019re not going to!\n\nYou immediately call a halt to all further acts of aggression on human settlements. You say you\u2019re going to concentrate on defending and holding on to what you have. Lisa isn\u2019t too pleased with this decision. You argue that what is the point of it all since you\u2019ve eliminated the greatest threat to mutants, while Lisa says as long as humans are around they\u2019ll always be a threat to mutants. You\u2019re not going to change your mind though; you\u2019ve made your decision.\n\nAdonis naturally feels like you\u2019ve cheated him out his chance to prove himself in true battle against humans. In the years to follow he joins the Dominion army and entertains himself by being cruel to the human subjects. One day in a human settlement called Ashtown, he goes too far and one of them actually fights back. In the ensuing struggle Adonis\u2019 face is hit by a small explosion, severely disfiguring his once relatively human looking appearance. Now all that is left is a horrific skinless face and little of his remaining sanity. In retaliation he orders the complete destruction of Ashotwn. When Lisa hears of this she wants even more vengeance and goes over your head as well to order the destruction of another town called Cinderville, by the time you can call a stop to any of this, both places have been razed to the ground and its inhabitants butchered.\n\nPreviously the humans under your rule were scared just enough not to start an uprising, some of them were even loyal, you always made sure never to be unnecessarily brutal even though Lisa and Adonis would prefer otherwise; so what occurs next isn\u2019t too surprising to you. These events as well as the liberties Adonis has been taking, has pushed them over the realms of fear and into hatred. You begin to have uprisings, and guerilla attacks all over the Dominion, some of the more fanatical ones even launch suicidal attacks on targets in Zeropolis.\n\nYou do your best to try to stop the attacks while at the same time trying to still be fair to the humans, but the time for that is long gone. Instead the mutant citizens just think you\u2019re being too weak.\n\nMore years go by and you\u2019re getting assassination attempts by other mutants calling for your blood. Parts of the Dominion begin to splinter as you unsuccessfully attempt to hold everything together. It\u2019s just like what happened to the Combine. Now you you\u2019re forced to become brutal just to keep everyone in line for a few months, but it\u2019s too late, now nobody likes you, not even your family which has been apparent for quite some time, but one time it goes to the point of no return.\n\nOne night while you\u2019re brooding to yourself in your private chambers, Adonis shows up before you with his own personal guards. You can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t see this coming as well.\n\n\u201cOld man you are no longer fit to rule the Zero Dominion! I\u2019m taking over!\u201d\n\u201cYou think you are...you\u2019re mother will be the one really running shit, because as far as I can tell you\u2019re barely capable of staging a coup.\u201d\n\u201cSHUT UP! KILL HIM!\u201d Adonis screams.\n\nYou might be older, but you\u2019re still relatively quick. You dodge for cover as Adonis\u2019 guards attempt to kill you. You pull your own weapon and with your usual deadly accuracy you blast every one of them, though Adonis has managed to sneak around behind you at this point. Being dramatic is his downfall as he attempts to slit your throat, but you manage to grab his arm and break it, before he can. He falls to the ground clutching his arm.\n\n\u201cStupid ass kid, don\u2019t bring a knife to a gun fight!\u201d you say standing up.\n\u201cYeah, and don\u2019t talk when you have the advantage, old man!\u201d Adonis retorts and a blade from his boot suddenly appears as he kicks up at your stomach, impaling you with it.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\nYou quickly dislodge yourself from the blade and stagger a bit before dropping your pistol. Adonis takes the advantage and side kicks you in the face, this time taking out one of you eyes. Oddly you don\u2019t even feel the pain; in fact you\u2019re beginning to feel pretty numb to everything right now.\n\n\u201cMom always said you were weak.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s the mama\u2019s boy\u2026I think you should call her, you need all the help you can get.\u201d\n\nThis little taunt throws Adonis off his game and he charges at you. You drop to the floor and trip him. When he falls face first to the ground you immediately shove your knee in his back and break his other arm.\n\n\u201cSorry son, but your name is Adonis, not Oedipus and you ain\u2019t gonna be killing me.\u201d\n\nAnd with that last statement you snap his neck.\n\nNow you start to feel the pain of your wounds, you\u2019ve lost quite a bit of blood, but you\u2019d probably be able to survive if you had the chance to get to the doctor, but you know you aren\u2019t going to get that chance.\n\nLisa walks in with pistol in hand, and at this point you don\u2019t even want to stop her even if you were in a position to do so.\n\n\u201cYou killed my poor son, he would\u2019ve ruled\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThink of it this way, now you can eliminate the middle man and just rule directly, just like you\u2019ve always wanted, just like you did with the Shadow Horde\u2026(groan) I think I\u2019ll just rest here for awhile. Yeah that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to die for what you\u2019ve done!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I kind of figured that, look I don\u2019t care anymore, don\u2019t you see that? It\u2019s been nothing but a fucking headache anyway. \u2026now if you\u2019re going to shoot, you go ahead, or just let me bleed to death because I just don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\n\nLisa looks genuinely upset, and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s solely over Adonis. Even after thinking you\u2019re unfit to rule or be her husband anymore, she\u2019s still reluctant to kill you.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it, what happened to you? Why couldn\u2019t you have just done what I wanted? To create a dynasty to last forever!\u201d\nAll I ever wanted was to live a peaceful life, well that didn\u2019t happen for a variety of reasons, but I guess I can say it wasn\u2019t boring. And there was the fact that I did get to meet you\u2026Lisa don\u2019t prolong this, just do it. It\u2019ll be easier for all of us. Tell Venus I love her as much as I still love her mother.\u201d\n\nLisa sheds a few tears and then carries out your request.\n\nSoon after your death Lisa takes over the Zero Dominion and does a much better job than you or Adonis could\u2019ve ever done. In the years to follow, she restores order and quells all rebellions. She might\u2019ve even brought in further territory had she not been assassinated by Venus, who always stayed quiet and in the background plotting and waiting for the right moment to strike. Strangely Venus never took over; instead she left Zeropolis and the Dominion altogether, letting it collapse into multiple civil wars until it destroyed itself.\n\nWhere she wound up is unknown, but being her father\u2019s daughter, it was probably someplace quiet and isolated.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Resist", "result": "As lovely of a creature she is, she\u2019s been the one leading your current enemy for years. She\u2019s most likely trying to lull you into a false sense of security to kill you; you won\u2019t allow yourself to fall for it.\n\nAs Lisa kisses and grinds into you, you muster all your strength and grab her to roll her over so that you\u2019re on top and firmly in control.\n\n\u201cOhhh\u2026okay\u2026if that\u2019s the way you want to do this, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Lisa says and for a brief moment you think she might\u2019ve been telling the truth about the alliance, however you go through with your plan.\n\n\u201cSorry baby, but I could never trust you. Maybe next life.\u201d You reply and snap her neck with one quick twist.\n\nAfter the deed is done you sit by the bed for quite some time by her lifeless body. You really wish you hadn\u2019t felt the need to do that, but given the fact that you\u2019ve been the perpetrator of as well as a victim of betrayal in the past you felt you had no choice.

They became much less of a direct threat, and as head of the Zeropolis Legion (As you renamed it) you were able to make the Dust District relatively safe once again. The idea of taking over the entire City was never something you want to pursue, so you just concentrated on building up the Dust District, however events conspire against you from living out a relatively conflict free life.\n\nRecently over the last few years, a cult of mutants called the Glow Children, have taken over a great portion of Zeropolis through their weird faith. They follow a leader calling themselves the Savior. In your experience, groups with any type of religious faith behind them are never willing to negotiate and they aren\u2019t an exception. They are utterly fanatical and devoted to their cause. They turn out to be worse than the Shadow Horde (In fact they also engage in attacks from the sewers as well, causing you to believe that ex-Shadow Horde members fill their ranks.) They\u2019ve made their headquarters (or Cathedral as it were) at the old hospital.\n\nThey attack the Dust District relentlessly, but the most disturbing thing you notice is how some of them carry high tech weaponry similar to the kind that you used to fight the Shadow Horde. Later you see some of the bigger Glow Children fitted with cybernetic implants. You know that the Combine won the war against the Cybernetic Evolution, but it would appear at least one of their number survived and are obviously remembering your past treachery. The day of reckoning is soon at hand.\n\nEventually one day while you\u2019re arranging yet another plan to take back parts of the Dust District you\u2019ve lost control over, your head quarters is attacked by several of the biggest mutants you\u2019ve ever seen. Many of them are of the cybernetic variety armed with weapons of devastating power that make quick work of your elite guards.\n\nAs you make your futile last stand with a plasma gun, one of the giant aberrations takes two shots to the chest and still manages to pick you up and rend you limb from limb with minimal effort on its part.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Leave", "result": "You know when you\u2019re not wanted.

The two soldiers now have their excuse, they raise their weapons and you do like wise. A small shoot out occurs in which you end up killing one of them and wounding the other, however they manage to wound you severely as well.

For some reason most of the mutants here don\u2019t seem to act like you do anymore. Many of them have gotten \u201cbetter\u201d and have even been engaging in somewhat normal activities. You know there are still hunting groups of others like you holdup in some nearby factories, but you were never a social animal, you\u2019re a lone hunter. You don\u2019t like to share.

You and your family\u2019s utmost protection is as important to us is it is to you! Our shelters are the best you\u2019ll find and, we have many shelters still available at various prices, but really can you put a price on your loved ones protection? Of course not! So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want one of our top of the line models that are still left! Okay so how many are in your family?\u201d\n\u201cUm, just me.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d the voice suddenly gets less chipper.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSir, don\u2019t you have ANY family?

We aren\u2019t in the business of selling shelters to those of low moral fiber sir\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck?! Just because I\u2019m single I gotta be some sort of low life? I\u2019m not luring fuckin\u2019 little girls into my car with lollipops!

Now then I understand your frustration, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. Our shelters were primarily built for families of at least four. To put singles in them wouldn\u2019t be fair to families that have children who shall surely be the ones to rebuild civilization, not to mention it would be a waste of resources. A single person would have an overstock of food and water since as I said we primarily cater to families and stock the shelters with families in mind.\u201d\n\u201cI fail to see how me having MORE than enough food and water is a bad thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI see sir, so you would be selfish and deprive a possible family of survival?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that! And wait a minute; wouldn\u2019t I be doing that anyway if I had a family of my own?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it would be different.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cYou would have a family sir.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re about ready to throw the phone against the wall in frustration.\n\n\u201cSo basically what you\u2019re telling me is you\u2019re not selling me a shelter.\u201d\n\u201cAh now I didn\u2019t say that sir! Since you\u2019re interested in buying our product and by your previous outburst I can tell you ARE a productive member of society. And it is only due to your poor social skills that you have been unable to take the necessary steps to have a family of your own! But never fear, GZS HAS kept your type in mind!\u201d\n\u201cGee, thanks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome sir! We have the Community Shelters for singles!

What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know too much about these Special Shelters myself sir, all I know is they have been equipped with the latest technology and VERY expensive. Anyone can buy one as long as they have the money to do so.\u201d\n\u201cWell how experimental are these things exactly?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said sir, I know little about these Special Shelters other than they are equipped with the latest technology. GZS has run tests and they are considered very safe and will protect you in the coming apocalypse, however due to time constraints GZS may have missed a few minor things, and as such we are legally required to warn\u2026er inform potential customers before they buy them.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Buy a room in the Community Shelter", "result": "As much as you\u2019re not keen on sharing, you\u2019re less keen on the idea of being shoved in an experimental shelter.

Why do you need to know all this shit?\u201d\n\u201cSir, as I said, we are a family orientated business, we aren\u2019t just a money motivated corporation, we are interested in the survival and well being of the human race. The human race can\u2019t thrive if people don\u2019t meet the necessary\u2026requirements. How can civilization be re-built if children aren\u2019t being born? I mean would you want to live in a society built by drug addicted mentally ill homosexual criminals?

You are then given the price, which is pretty steep, but you can afford it. Besides if the world is ending it\u2019s not like you\u2019re really going to need money anymore. Which makes you wonder why GZS is in business at all. What\u2019s the point of going to the trouble of building bomb shelters for Armageddon if all the profit they make is most likely going to be useless in the aftermath?\n\nOh well that\u2019s not your concern, you\u2019re just glad you passed the damn interrogation and got into the shelter. Of course now you\u2019re subjected to some last minute rules.\n\n\u201cOkay sir, you are now in the system and registered. You may move into the Shelter at anytime as long you pay the fee required to the automatic teller as previously described to you. If you don\u2019t pay, you can\u2019t get in obviously. Cash, check, or debit card are acceptable. NO Credit Cards will be accepted! Now then some rules. You do not have to bring anything with you, but it is recommended that you do bring your own clothing if you wish to wear something different as the days go by. Food and drinkable liquids are acceptable, but not necessary. Do not bring in private medical supplies or repair equipment, the shelter has been stocked with those items, we do not want people bringing in potential weapons or illegal drugs. Speaking of which, DO NOT attempt to bring in any kind of weapon! Guns and knives are strictly prohibited! Attempting to bring in either one will result in non-admittance of the shelter! Same goes for drugs of any kind. Alcohol is frowned upon, but accepted. There WILL be a machine to scan you before you\u2019re allowed to enter, so do not think you will be able to sneak anything in! Now then I trust our transaction has ended. If you have anymore questions please contact our customer service line. Good day sir, may your first child be a masculine one and thank you for choosing Ground Zero Survival!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it, all you have to do is get what stuff you want to take with you and move in, might as well do it now, no sense in waiting until you see the nuclear cloud. You wonder if you shouldn\u2019t try to \u201cbeat the system\u201d by sneaking your weapon in though.\n\nUltimately you decide this is survival. You need every advantage you can get. You don\u2019t know what kind of people you\u2019re going to be stuck with, so you take your pistol with you and a few \u201cnon-lethal\u201d supplies such as duct tape.

You\u2019re in a small foyer with an elevator door and ATM like machine; you\u2019re guessing that\u2019s the automatic teller you were told about.\n\nBefore you start pressing buttons you need to figure out how you\u2019re going to get your pistol through the scanning process, because you can be sure if you fail something nasty will happen\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Duct tape the pistol to the ceiling", "result": "GZS probably has some sort of scanner that does a little more than just scan your body, so just not having the gun on your person most likely isn\u2019t going to work.\n \nYou get the idea that the machine is probably not going to scan the ceiling though, so you get out your duct tape and fix it to the pistol, you then climb on top of the automatic teller and jump up to stick the pistol on the ceiling. You end up falling on your ass, but you succeed. You then press some buttons on the machine, where it proceeds to ask your name and how you\u2019re going to pay. You type in your name and insert you debit card where upon it drains most of your account. The door you stepped through sudden shuts and a hum is heard.

Oh I guess it\u2019s a safety feature. The elevator automatically goes back up so the other people can get in as quickly as possible. Ron suggested that they might\u2019ve thought someone would deliberately try to keep the elevator down here to prevent anyone else from seeking shelter. Though I can\u2019t honestly imagine that anyone would do such a horrible thing.\u201d\n\u201cBeen living on earth long Nina?\u201d you ask rhetorically. \u201cGreat, so I\u2019m basically trapped down here due to the brilliant engineering minds of GZS\u2026so is it just us so far or are their other people here too?\u201d\n\u201dThere are a few others, if you come with us we can introduce you to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe later, look we\u2019re gonna be stuck down here for a long time so I\u2019ll get to know everyone soon enough, right now I just want to go to my room and rest.\u201d\n\u201cErm, okay\u2026\u201d Ron says as you push past them both.\n\nYou head to your room which is equipped with the basic requirements; food and water dispenser, shower, bed, and a cabinet. (You hide your pistol in your mattress) There\u2019s a standard Shelter Operations Manual sitting on the table as well as a Shelter Booklet about socialization, rules, guidelines and such, both of which you skim through every now and then. There\u2019s a big public recreation area and a couple of other public rooms where your neighbors gather, but you stay in your room and keep to yourself for the most part. Sometimes in the middle of the night when nobody else is around you\u2019ll watch the TV in the living area to keep up on current events.\n\nYou hear other people arriving over the month. Ron and Nina greet them all, you can tell those two are going to be the ones to \u201corganize\u201d shit and probably try to decide what\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d for everyone. Always saying stuff that they read in the booklet.\n\n\u201cFucking busy bodies\u2026\u201d you say as you fall asleep watching the world in its death throes on TV\u2026\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n\u201c\u2026BEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u2026\u201d\n\nYou groggily wake up and see a test pattern on TV.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou feel a small tremor and then you turn off the TV, just as Nina and Ron come walking in.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Nina asks.\n\u201cTest pattern, I think Armageddon arrived.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWhat?! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d Ron exclaims.\n\u201cWhy are you so surprised? I mean that was the whole point of coming down here right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I dunno\u2026I just wasn\u2019t prepared for it actually happening.\u201d\n\u201cChrist, Ron I\u2019ve overheard you say you were the first one in this goddamn shelter, you of all people should\u2019ve long gotten used to the idea of living down here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your problem? You been nothing but hostile since you\u2019ve got here!\u201d Nina exclaims.\n\u201cMy problem is I\u2019m stuck down here with a bunch of people I don\u2019t really know and if you two are any indication I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you even qualify to get a room down here?\u201d\n\u201cGood clean living I guess, so is there supposed to be something special we do now?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah I think so, it mentions something in the booklet I was reading that came with the shelter, we\u2019re supposed to gather everyone and tell them.\u201d\n\u201cOkay well I guess you guys go do that then. I\u2019m just going to check on something here.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but we\u2019re supposed to have some sort of vote to decide on how this place is going to be run, if you don\u2019t show up you don\u2019t get a vote.\u201d Ron reminds you.\n\u201cI know Ron, I\u2019ve read the booklet.\u201d You answer unenthusiastically.\n\nRon and Nina leave you and go tell the others of the situation and follow other things it states in the booklet. You\u2019re wondering if you should even stay down here. All these people seem completely different than you. You wish there was someway to call the elevator back down, but after checking a GZS computer it states that it won\u2019t come back until it detects that the surface is safe for habitation again\u2026which basically means not in your lifetime.\n\nIt\u2019s probably just as well since the surface probably isn\u2019t the safest place you\u2019d want to be, lord knows what the hell it looks like now, not to mention the radiation factor. Then again you\u2019d still like the option to leave if you wanted to. You go back to your room, read and enjoy the solitude until Nina comes to get you.\n\n\u201cHey! You didn\u2019t show up for the meeting! We\u2019re discussing which ways this place could be run, are you coming or what?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go vote", "result": "\u201c(Sigh) Fine, I\u2019ll attend this exercise in futility, but what the hell are we doing exactly, so I\u2019m not just jumping into shit.\u201d You ask as you and Nina walk towards the conference room.\n\u201cWell right now we\u2019re voting on a shelter leader. Someone to make the final decisions about important things. So far Ron is tied with another. In fact the only reason why I came to get you, was so you could break the tie.\u201d\n\u201cWhoopie, I feel honored I can take an important part in this democratic process. So who\u2019s the other person?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that would be Elliot. He was one of the later arrivals, but is very personable. Not that you\u2019d know since I doubt you\u2019ve even seen him given that you lock yourself in you room all the time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know who he is, bald guy. So I take it you want Ron to win huh?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t, but Elliot\u2019s seems like a good guy too, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019d make a good leader as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you run? I mean you seem to like to organize things.\u201d\n\u201cMe? Oh no, I\u2019m not a leader.\u201d\n\u201cWell from what I\u2019ve seen of Ron, he isn\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nNina stops you in the corridor.\n\n\u201cDamn it, stop being an asshole! At least Ron makes an attempt to get involved in things! You haven\u2019t done shit since you got here except insult people and lock yourself away! Like it or not we\u2019re ALL in this together! And you better start getting with the program and contribute!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck? I am contributing; I\u2019m going to this goddamn meeting aren\u2019t I? And you better watch your tone; remember I\u2019M the swing vote for your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cRon isn\u2019t my boyfriend! I mean\u2026not yet\u2026uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You mean he isn\u2019t taping your ass yet? Shit, he\u2019s stupider than I thought then, because he\u2019d be lucky to get someone who looks like you even if you are annoying.\u201d\n\nNina stands and stares at you in disbelief.\n\n\u201c\u2026could you possibly be any more vile?\u201d\n\u201cProbably, but we don\u2019t have time for that, I gotta vote for some dickhead.\u201d\n\nYou continue to the conference room (with Nina no longer walking with you) and when you finally arrive everyone is there as if they\u2019ve been waiting for you. You don\u2019t even really care who\u2019s in charge since more than likely no matter who you vote for is going to be an intrusive bastard wanting everyone to do something.\n\nYou can vote for Ron. As far as leadership material, you don\u2019t really see him as one, though he seems to have some planning skills and friendly to people so maybe he\u2019s got the stuff.\n\nElliot you barely know anything about, he also seems to be an organizer and friendly to everyone, but not to the point that it\u2019s irritating. Though to you there\u2019s something a little creepy about him.\n\nAh what the hell, you know this is something Ron wants more than anything why not give it to him? Besides he\u2019s not very \u201cstrong\u201d which means you can probably get away with disobeying him on a regular basis without causing a big scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll vote for Ron.\u201d You say, Nina looks surprised and Ron jumps up and down like an idiot in celebration. You take that as your opportunity to go back to your room, Nina once again stops you in the corridor.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say thanks for doing this; I know you don\u2019t even like Ron\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care one way or another about him, if he wants the headache of running this place he can have it, he better just not ask too much of me, I did my bit. You can think of me as his kingmaker. See ya around.\u201d\n\nYou go back to your room and that\u2019s where you spend a majority of your time. You don\u2019t really mix with anyone, and nobody really makes the attempt with you either. You\u2019re asked to contribute to some \u201cevents\u201d sometimes, but you always ignore such requests and nothing happens. Nina still hangs around Ron like a love sick school girl, but for god knows what reason he seems completely oblivious to the fact. And obviously she hasn\u2019t told him how she feels about him. You watch this comical display replay itself over and over.\n\n\u201cYeah, GZS really picked some excellent candidates to pair up to create families for the so called future, what a joke.\u201d You mutter to yourself.\n\nTime goes by and Ron goes about his duties which mainly consist of discussing pointless plans in the conference room. The idiot can\u2019t do ANYTHING without talking about it with others he appointed as advisors first! If somebody\u2019s shower is broken they have to discuss when, how and WHY it has to be fixed! Naturally everyone disagree about one point and they have to start all over again which usually means nothing gets done. A lot of planning and organizing of ideas, but no actual implementations of those same ideas.\n\nThe shelter starts falling into disrepair, a few fixes are made here and there, but they\u2019re more jury-rigged ones more than anything. Nobody has perfectly functioning rooms from what you know\u2026well except yours since you do nothing, but study the shelter manual all the time attempting to learn more about how it works giving you an edge in repairing your own room. (In fact you just permanently took a repair kit for yourself out of the equipment room) You really don\u2019t understand why other people aren\u2019t doing the same instead of waiting around for things to get repaired or complaining about needing things to get repaired. Everyone has the same damn operations manual. Read it!\n\nAbout six months go by and finally you\u2019re given an unexpected visit during the night. You answer your door. It\u2019s Elliot and some other people.\n\n\n\u201cMay we come in?\u201d Elliot asks.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cJust to talk about the future of the shelter.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well you can talk to Ron about that, he\u2019s the big shelter leader.\u201d\n\u201cYes he is, thanks to you. And that\u2019s also why this shelter is in such bad shape. Ron is ruining this place with his ineptitude.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, don\u2019t blame that shit on me, that\u2019s RON\u2019S fault, not mine. And besides MY room works fine. If you lazy bastards would actually read the damn shelter manual you wouldn\u2019t have any problems.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ve read the manual, I\u2019m sure many people have. But surely you must realize most people don\u2019t have the natural talent to fix thing that perhaps you have. Besides I\u2019m sure you must also be aware that in a community each person has his own talents. For example Leon behind me used to be a bouncer. Don\u2019t you think with his skills he\u2019d make an excellent head of security around here?\u201d\n\nLeon folds his big black arms almost daring you to say \u201cNo.\u201d before Elliot continues.\n\n\u201cMy point is me and a few others are planning to take Ron out of office for gross incompetence. Did you know Fred and Greta are planning to have a baby? The first one to be born in here. The population in this shelter isn\u2019t going to be stable forever. It\u2019s going to grow and we NEED to keep this place running efficiently if we\u2019re ALL going to survive. I know you\u2019re a solitary person\u2026I even respect that, but the time has come for you to choose between life or death. By joining our group, you\u2019re choosing life. By remaining locked away in here, you\u2019re choosing death not just for all of us, but for yourself. No man is an island.\u201d\n\nElliot has a bit of duality to his speech. Part of him sounds genuinely concerned for the future of the shelter; he may even have a point. But the other part of him sounds like he\u2019s politely threatening you. And you\u2019re not sure of the whole \u201ctaking Ron out of office\u201d thing. It almost sounds like he plans on taking over by force. You get the impression he and his little group are going to do just that regardless of whether you join or not.", "action_results": [{"action": "Decline", "result": "\u201cYeah, well you do what you have to do, just leave me out of it. Your little power struggle with Ron isn\u2019t any of my concern. And if and when you do take power don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be ordering me around either.\u201d\n\nElliot\u2019s expression changes to that of someone very perturbed by your response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed to hear you say that, I really thought you could have a place in the new community I was planning.\u201d\n\u201cThink again, now get outta here\u2026\u201d\n\nYou begin to shove Elliot out of your doorway, but Leon reaches over his shoulder and shoves you back with great strength. You fall backwards on to your floor, Elliot and his gang start to enter. He pulls out a scalpel, something he probably got from the medical supplies. You happen to be right next to your mattress, so you reach in and grab your pistol to point it directly at Elliot. Now they all look like they just seen a ghost and all the bravery has drained out of them except Leon, who looks like this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had a gun pointed at him, but he\u2019s still stepping back.\n\n\u201cYou wanna fuckin\u2019 take another step motherfucker? Go ahead, I fuckin\u2019 dare you!\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, he\u2019s got a fuckin\u2019 gun Elliot!\u201d a women in his group says.\n\u201cI can see that Brenda! Okay, look maybe we got off on the wrong foot here. I mean obviously you\u2019re a more resourceful man than I thought\u2026I mean as far as I know you\u2019re the only one in this place with a goddamn gun. How\u2019d you manage that?\u201d\n\u201cNever you mind, just get the fuck outta here!\u201d\n\u201cVery well, but remember, you don\u2019t have any friends in this place, and you can\u2019t watch your back all the time\u2026\u201d\n\nElliot has just announced his intentions of eliminating you whenever it\u2019s possible. You\u2019ll have to live in constant paranoia now. Unless\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot him now", "result": "Always one to solve a problem before it starts\u2026\n\n\nYou pull the trigger and blast Elliot square in the chest. He looks down in disbelief and then slumps down on the floor by your feet. You then get up from the floor as everyone else runs out of the room.\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought! So much for your fearless leader!\u201d\n\nAs you drag Elliot\u2019s body out of your room, everyone else in the shelter has come out of their own rooms after hearing the gun shot and screaming.\n\n\u201cOH MY GOD! HE\u2019S GOT A GUN!\u201d someone shouts.\n\u201cHE\u2019S KILLED ELLIOT!\u201d another screams.\n\nEveryone is very afraid of what you\u2019re going to do next. Only Nina dares approach you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you killed him? I always knew you were anti-social, but\u2026oh my god\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I fuckin\u2019 killed Elliot! And YOU of all people oughta be damn well glad I did! He was planning on taking over this place from your boyfriend Ron!\u201d\n\u201cRon\u2019s not my boyfriend! And I don\u2019t believe you! Elliot was gracious in his defeat! He was a good man unlike you!\u201d\n\u201cYeah he was so good he tried to recruit me for his little rebellion gang, and don\u2019t try to hide in the fuckin\u2019 crowd Leon and act like you weren\u2019t there! All of you fuckers hiding right now, came to my room with Elliot! And lemme ask you this, WHY the hell would ANY of them come to MY room? Everyone knows I don\u2019t invite people!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno what to say right now\u2026please just put down the gun\u2026I don\u2019t want you to kill anyone else\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake Nina I\u2019m not a mass murderer! It was self-defense! He was gonna kill me, just like he was gonna kill Ron and shit maybe he should\u2019ve, the fuckstick\u2019s supposed to be the shelter leader and he\u2019s not even here for this! Where is Ron?\u201d\n\nNina suddenly wonders where he\u2019s at as well, she runs over to his door which is still shut.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, he\u2019s THAT much of deep sleeper.\u201d You mutter while standing by Elliot\u2019s dead body.\n\nNina doesn\u2019t even knock, apparently she\u2019s got her own key to get in his room. You\u2019re STILL wondering why nothing has happened between those two yet, your questions are soon answered, and everyone is in for another surprise this eventful night.\n\n\u201cEEEEEEEEEEEK! NO!\u201d you hear Nina scream when she goes inside the room and then runs back out crying. Ron steps out in his underwear.\n\n\u201cNo, wait! Nina, its not what it looks like!\u201d he shouts to her and then another guy in his underwear comes out. You think his name is William, you never knew too much about him before, but you know MORE than you wanted to now!\n\n\u201cGet back inside William!\u201d when Ron sees that there\u2019s a whole crowd of people staring in various states of shock. It\u2019s too late though now, everyone knows.\n\n\u201cWow Nina sure is a good judge of character, she thought Elliot was a good man and she thought you were straight. Looks like I wasn\u2019t the only one with a secret in this shelter! Heh heh.\u201d\n\nRon finally turns to you and sees what you\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201c\u2026You got a gun? YOU FUCKIN\u2019 KILLED ELLIOT?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Not this again! Yeah I fuckin\u2019 killed him. He tried to kill me and he was planning on killing you to take over this dump!\u201d\n\u201cNow just calm down, and put down the gun\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting down shit and I\u2019m not killing anyone else unless someone gives me cause to do so! What the fuck, was the dick in your mouth so good to you, you didn\u2019t hear the gunshots and screaming out here? I\u2019m sick of explaining this twice! Now I\u2019M going back into MY room to get some sleep! And none of you better fucking disturb me for the rest of the night! And someone better clean up Elliot\u2019s carcass from in front of my room when I wake up tomorrow!\u201d\n\nYou return to your room.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think that went well.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nAfter the night of multiple \u201cincidents\u201d a lot of things happen. The first, is Elliot\u2019s body being the first one dumped into the incinerator. The second being that Ron is immediately voted out by his own council who all follow the GZS guidelines. Apparently being gay was more of an offense than being incompetent, since GZS guidelines were explicit in not wanting homosexuals in the Community Shelters which he obviously lied about. Nina is unsurprisingly the most vocal about his vote out; in fact she ends up taking over. Ron and William move into a separate far room together and become social pariahs. Everyone who was previously friendly with Ron suddenly starts treating him like garbage. You never really cared for him, and thought he was an incompetent moron, but even you think it\u2019s shitty for them to all just turn on him over who he happens to be fucking. But that\u2019s how people are and that\u2019s why you try to avoid them.\n\nYour situation is a little different, they can\u2019t really treat you like a social pariah mainly because you were always one to begin with and another because everyone\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll shoot them. All of Elliot\u2019s former friends have no doubt reinforced the belief in others that you\u2019re dangerous. You don\u2019t really care though, just as long as nobody fucks with you and stays out of your way (Which everyone does for the most part since you now walk around with it at all times)\n\nA year passes\u2026\n\nThe shelter sees its first baby born and there are a couple of other pregnant women ready to pop as well. Nina has improved the place a little bit more. No doubt without anyone to fawn over now she\u2019s throwing herself into her work. There\u2019s actually a guy (Kyle) who\u2019s has some medical knowledge now, they still don\u2019t really have a good \u201ctech guy\u201d though and things are still being jury-rigged. Nina knows with a growing population this shelter needs to be in tip top running condition.\n\nYou get that expected knock on the door.\n\n\u201cHello, Nina.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah hi. Look, I just want to know if you have any intention of helping us out or if you\u2019re still going to remain an isolated asshole.\u201d\n\nNothing like being blunt. Politics has really hardened Nina, she\u2019s all business now it seems and lot less na\u00efve.\n\nHow strangely appealing\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Help out the community", "result": "\u201cYou know what Nina? I\u2019m in a charitable mood. What do you need?\u201d\n\u201cWe need you to hack into the central GZS computer system to bring the elevator down.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect that one. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cCan you do it?\u201d Nina asks without answering your question.\n\u201cWell in theory I might. I\u2019ve fucked around with that computer when nobody was around in the past, but I\u2019ve never really gotten into the inner workings of the system, and I\u2019ve read as much as I can about the shelter itself. Damn thing\u2019s touchy though. I just worry that if I do the wrong thing I\u2019ll end up shutting the whole shelter down and doom us all.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean doom yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWell that too, but you still never told me what you want to bring the elevator down for.\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna do it or not?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, what happens if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just get one of my own people to attempt it and hope they don\u2019t doom us all accidentally.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Well played Nina, you know I\u2019m gonna do it now. Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou and Nina enter the Community Shelter computer room, where a couple of Nina\u2019s tech\u2019s are tinkering with the Central GZS computer.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing!? Give me that!\u201d you yell taking a screw driver away from one of them. You recognize them both Todd and Charles if you remember correctly.\n\u201cOh man, its you! Okay, don\u2019t get mad!\u201d Todd says backing off. Charles does like wise.\n\u201cSheesh, I\u2019m not going to shoot you! I\u2019m just trying to prevent you from fucking up what\u2019s basically our life support system! Its barely working right as it is! I swear GZS put us in a death trap down here.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then do you need any help? Or should we leave you alone while you do this?\u201d Nina asks.\n\u201cWhat do you think fearless leader?\u201d\n\u201cRight. Come on let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nNina and the other two leave and you get to work. You first do a system scan to what\u2019s going on exactly. Wow, this place really is in some bad shape! You can see where some fixes have been made, but without a really skilled technician routinely checking in on stuff, things are never going to get better in this place, you shutter to think what would\u2019ve happened with Ron still in control. This place might\u2019ve very well lost all power. You\u2019re sort of glad you\u2019ve begun to take an interest. MAYBE after you manage to get the elevator down you might just volunteer to upkeep this thing.\n\nYou start delving into the inner working of the system; GZS really didn\u2019t want folks bringing the elevator down! You accidentally cut some lighting temporarily which causes you to hear some yelling from a distance.\n\n\u201cOh toughen up.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nYou continue to work and eventually you successfully override the safety protocol for the elevator and it starts its decent.\n\n\u201cHa ha, I rule.\u201d You say as you come out of the computer room.\n\u201cDid you do it?\u201d Nina asks.\n\u201cSure did. NOW are you going to tell me why we\u2019re bringing it down?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see for yourself. Leon, bring both of the perverts out, this has been a long time coming\u2026\u201d\n\nYou notice that everyone\u2019s standing around right now, like some special event is going down. Leon eventually comes back with Ron and William in tow, and he looks like he roughed them up first so they\u2019d struggle less.\n\nThe elevator door opens up for the first time.\n\n\u201cPut both of these\u2026criminals in the elevator Leon.\u201d Nina says. Leon does so, with a lot of protesting and pleading from both, but another couple punches shut them up. Now you know why Nina wanted you to bring the elevator down\u2026exile. If this was a year ago and they were throwing Ron out in the wasteland for his bungling of shelter management, you\u2019d probably be the first to applaud. But what\u2019s going on right now is for the wrong damn reasons, and you know Nina\u2019s just being a petty bitch who\u2019s still harboring resentment for shit she really brought on herself with completely clueless judgment on her part.\n\n\u201cAlright, Nina I know you\u2019re fucking upset because your make believe boyfriend turned out to be a fag, but that was a goddamn year ago\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up! This has nothing to do with that! This is about justice! These two are in violation of GZS guidelines carrying on with\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh will you shut up about that shit? I\u2019m starting to believe the entire GZS Corporation were a bunch of fucking loonies with too much time on their hands! They build these fucking shelters that break down all the goddamn time, with no way to get back to the surface and trapping everyone down here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell are you defending these two? You\u2019ve never been one to give a fucking shit before! You know I\u2019ve never seen you pursue any women around here even if you were slightly appealing enough for any of them to have you. What are you gay too?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) No, Nina because if I was I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve been the first one to want to spread your legs for me. Look I\u2019m just saying this ain\u2019t fucking right okay?\u201d\n\u201cOh and YOU\u2019RE the fucking expert on what\u2019s right? You fucking KILLED a man! You fucking snuck a gun in here a shot somebody! So is the gun an extension of your manhood and you just couldn\u2019t live without it?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know Nina, you seem awfully pre-occupied with my sexual habits. Shit, if you want me to fuck you already just come out and say it and stop beating around bush. I\u2019d say that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been needing since you got in here anyway, because I haven\u2019t seen YOU with anyone either, that didn\u2019t turn out to be a complete fucking homo of course.\u201d\n\nYour remark is met with a long period of silence. The rest of the shelter population has been in absolute awe, this is probably the most exciting thing that\u2019s happened since you shot Elliot. Nina looks at you hard and recomposes herself.\n\n\u201cAre you going to send the elevator up, or not?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Send the elevator up", "result": "You throw your hands up.\n\n\u201cAlright, fuck it then. You\u2019re right. What the hell do I care? Shoulda been more careful Ron.\u201d\n\nYou turn around and go back to the computer room to send the elevator up, you hear the pitiful begging from Ron, followed up by a couple of verbal abusive insults from Nina. Sheesh, she\u2019s turned into a real bitch. You better make yourself semi-useful so that vengeful attitude doesn\u2019t turn too much on you. You figure the best way to do that is to start monitoring and working with the GZS central computer, besides you need to look after this thing anyway. You don\u2019t feel safe with those other two idiots looking after it.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Looks like I\u2019m working again.\u201d You say as you press the button to send the elevator up.\n\nFour years pass...\n\nYou\u2019ve been here five years and things have changed.\n\nThe population has grown a bit, but not a lot since Nina\u2019s pettiness helps keep the population down. Nina, has thrown at least ten people into \u201cexile\u201d. Anyone who only mildly displeases or disagrees with her, is often shown the elevator\u2026unless they happen to be providing a useful skill like you. Nina really hates the fact that you\u2019re the only competent technician she has. You manage to keep things from breaking down constantly like they were, but only just the minimum. You purposely don\u2019t keep things running at maximum efficiency, since as long as you\u2019re needed you won\u2019t be in danger\u2026of course there IS the fact you have a gun that also keeps you safe, but there\u2019s never any harm in having a couple of safety nets. The more the better.\n\nIn fact, you wonder about losing one of your safety nets. Todd and Charles have increased in their technical knowledge over the years, and granted they still aren\u2019t as skilled as you; they might actually be competent one day. And they do a lot less back talking than you\u2026\n\n\nYou wonder if you should do something to ensure your position. Todd and Charles come in talking about some old movie they watched in the community living area. It would be really easy to just shoot them. Who would stop you? And what could anyone do about it?", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot them both", "result": "Oh well, you were never that close to them anyway\u2026\n\n\nYou reach for your weapon, while Todd and Charles are still talking. You blast Charles in the neck making blood spurt all over Todd who stares in shock. Your next shot hits Todd in the head.\n\nWith both of them dead you suddenly feel a whole lot better and go back to work. Naturally the sound of the shots brings people to come running.\n\n\u201cOH NO! HE\u2019S DONE IT AGAIN!\u201d someone shouts and runs back out of the room. Pretty soon Nina and her goon Leon come in. Nina sees the two bodies on the floor and looks more pissed off than afraid of you.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do that for?\u201d\n\u201cJust ensuring my position Nina, I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking psychotic sonofabitch! You can\u2019t just go around shooting people!\u201d\n\u201cOh don\u2019t EVEN be claiming moral superiority here Nina, you who throws people into Exile just because they\u2019re looking at you funny! In fact Todd and Charles deaths are your fault not mine, I can\u2019t help if I feel threatened that you might replace me and throw me out on to the surface as well.\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn you, if you didn\u2019t have that gun or the only reliable tech, I\u2019d throw you out of here so fast\u2026\u201d\n\u201cExactly! So I\u2019m glad we\u2019re in agreement\u2026it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the\u2026look, just because you got that fuckin\u2019 gun doesn\u2019t mean shit! I\u2019M still in charge of this place!\u201d\n\nYou stand up and shoot Leon three times, he falls backwards smacking his head against a table before taking his last breath. Now Nina starts to get worried, you just shot her head goon who was intimidating everyone else. She doesn\u2019t have that leverage anymore. Of course right now she\u2019s not worried about staying in power, for the first time she\u2019s worried about you shooting her. You\u2019re up close and personal, threatening her with it.\n\n\u201cSee that Nina? What the fuck are ya gonna do now? Who are ya gonna get to throw people into exile? In case you haven\u2019t realized it yet, but I\u2019M in fuckin\u2019 charge of this goddamn place! I just let you think you are! Now I suggest you take your ass outta here and try to figure out how you\u2019re gonna stay in power. Because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of people not fond of you either, but unlike me they can actually do something about you.\nGuess I know who\u2019ll be the next exile! Ha Ha!\u201d you then lick Nina\u2019s face.\n\nNina backs out of the room in a hurry, leaving you alone with a room full of dead bodies.\n\n\u201cGet up, you lazy fucks, we got work to do!\u201d you say kicking Todd\u2019s body in a macabre joke to yourself.\n\n Perhaps stepping over the line of killing Todd and Charles with no provocation unhinged you a bit. And killing Leon certainly put you over the edge. Granted Nina\u2019s no saint, but what you\u2019re doing is just as bad. You kind of got a power rush, from your deeds today and you must say you really liked it.\n\nAfter making sure everything\u2019s working properly and even increasing the efficiency a bit, you decide to call it a day at the computer room. You leave stepping over the bodies that nobody\u2019s come to clean up yet.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re still here, I guess I\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d You say.\n\nYou make your way back to your room. The corridors seem to be clear of folks, probably afraid of all the stuff that went down today so they\u2019re keeping their heads down. Good.\n\nBefore you get ready to go to sleep, you get a knock on the door, you answer it, ready to shoot someone else again, but see Nina in her underwear instead. You\u2019re a little surprised.\n\n\u201cNina, what the hell are you doing?\u201d unsure of how to respond.\n\nNina begins to talk in a way you\u2019ve never heard her speak before, seductive, yet vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI was doing some thinking like you said back in the computer room\u2026and you\u2019re right. I won\u2019t hold anymore power here anymore\u2026I\u2019ll probably get thrown onto the surface like you said\u2026unless I ally myself with someone who has power, and you\u2019re the only one with that kind of power.\u201d\n\u201cI see, so what does this conclusion you\u2019ve come to mean exactly?\u201d\n\nNina takes your hand and puts it on her body, starting with her firm breasts and moving it lower to the promised land.\n\n\u201cIt means I\u2019m yours, in everyway imaginable, every night, any time, just please don\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d\n\nNina then nuzzles up against you and begins kissing on you gently for further enticement in her desperate plan to save herself.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to resist her offer. In more ways than one. This reminds you of those prison movies where one of them offers to be the bitch in exchange for protection, except this is better because Nina\u2019s female!", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept her offer", "result": "You don\u2019t think about it, you don\u2019t answer; you let your actions speak. You pull her inside and close the door while she continues to kiss on you. As she kisses on your chest you begin pushing her head lower. She gets on her knees and begins servicing you like a common whore.\n\nAfter you reach your climax, she insists that she\u2019s not done and wants to show you even more of what she\u2019s capable of tonight. You and her fall back to the bed where she slips off her panties, mounts you and begins the second round.\n\nIn the throes of love making while you\u2019re closing your eyes saying \u201cRide the horse baby! Ride the fuckin\u2019 horse!\u201d  you climax again, and when you open them, you get a nasty surprise of your own fucking gun being pointed at your face.\n\n\u201cRaise your fuckin\u2019 hands motherfucker!\u201d she says calmly. You comply.\n\u201cWhoa! Hold on! Don\u2019t shoot! Weren\u2019t we just having fun?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you were, but this was just a means to an end for me\u2026I fully intend on scrubbing myself thoroughly after this, the fact that you came inside me twice sickens me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, just settle down Nina, I know you\u2019re a little upset about what I did earlier today, but I wasn\u2019t actually going to hurt you. Just got a little trigger happy that\u2019s all! I dunno I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately! I\u2026\u201d\n\u201dSHUT UP! You ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 your way outta this! This is about survival and being in control!\u201d\n\nSensing nothing else to lose you become threatening.\n\n\u201cOh yeah? Well fuck you! Because I\u2019M still in fuckin\u2019 control then! Without me nobody knows how to run the goddamn computer the right way! I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 necessary to your fuckin\u2019 survival, you stupid bitch!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s bitch! Especially not yours!\u201d\n\nBefore you can retort to that remark, Nina blows your brains out.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline", "result": "You push her away; you\u2019re not fooled by this act.\n\n\n\u201cNina, maybe your feminine wiles worked on Leon, but that shit ain\u2019t gonna work on me, I know what the fuck you\u2019re up to. You think I\u2019m gonna let you distract me and let you grab my pistol while we\u2019re fucking? Not fucking likely!\u201d\n\n\nNina attempts to continue with her tactic and gets next to you again.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I want your protection. I wouldn\u2019t try to betray you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay. You\u2019re serious eh? We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\nYou pull Nina in the room and lock the door. You then take your pistol, unload it, and then put it on the far side of the room. Nina\u2019s face looks little less \u201cin the mood\u201d now.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go then.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Plan backfire? Too late for regrets now, now we can either do this voluntarily or INvoluntarily\u2026and on the path I\u2019ve been going lately I think you know that I\u2019m fully capable of doing it. Pfft. I don\u2019t need a gun for you. So, what\u2019s it gonna be Nina?\u201d\n\n\nNina looks around, probably looking for something to throw at you, but she realizes that it would probably be in vain. She\u2019s obviously scared, but still tries to maintain some bravery in this hopeless situation that you\u2019ve put her in.\n\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026but don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\n\nYour increasingly chaotic personality changes again and you go up to Nina in a \u201cloving\u201d fashion.\n\n\n\u201cAw baby, I won\u2019t hurt you. Just know your place and I\u2019ll take care of you, I promise.\u201d\n\n\nYou fuck Nina eight ways from doomsday that night. You can\u2019t speak for Nina, but you know YOU enjoyed yourself. The only absolute positive for Nina is that she IS now under your protection and nobody dares to do anything to her now.\n\n\nA few months pass and you keep expecting her to try to do something to betray you, but nothing happens. Either she\u2019s resigned herself to being \u201cyours\u201d or she\u2019s content on taking her aggression out on others. Her time with you doesn\u2019t make her any more compassionate to others, if anything she\u2019s gotten worse. She doesn\u2019t threaten people with exile anymore, now she just threatens them with you.\n\n\nMeanwhile you begin to slowly descend into a sociopathic personality. The only thing that prevents you from shooting everyone is the fact that you\u2019re getting off on their fear a lot more than if you killed them. You keep the computer room locked so only you may access it.\n\n\nYou and her are pretty much running the place now.\n\n\nFive more years pass\u2026\n\n\nThe shelter is a living nightmare to most people. They live in constant fear that you or Nina will do something to them. Nina has developed a twisted sort of love for you, and while you have a certain fondness for her, you don\u2019t really give a shit about anything anymore, you barely even keep the computer working right anymore, now you just make sure your room is running properly. Nina is a permanent fixture at your place, so you don\u2019t even need to look after her room even if you were inclined to do so.\n\n\nWhile the people were living in fear of you, initially you were at least somewhat looking after their welfare, but now you aren\u2019t even doing that. Now the fear turns into hatred and resentment. The cowering worms have evolved to grow spines. They begin devising a plan.\n\n\nOne day Nina gets into a cat fight with another woman, Greta. She beats her pretty badly, until her husband Fred steps in and begins beating the hell out of her. As is typical Nina runs off to tell you, at which point you come out of the computer room ready to shoot someone. Fred stands up to you, and says Nina was the one who started it and he was just protecting his wife as if his explanation means anything to you.\n\n\n\u201cDuly noted. And I understand your view, but as you must be able to see I have a view of things as well\u2026that\u2019s a nice kid you got there.\u201d\n\n\nYou shoot Fred and Greta\u2019s son right before their eyes. Greta screams and Fred lunges at you, causing you to shoot him as well, but not before he tackles you to the floor. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity, a few other bystanders take advantage of the situation, your sole means of power and intimidation is taken from you, as you are kicked and beaten repeatedly. Nina is treated the same way. Suddenly the beatings stop and as you attempt to get up you feel the barrel against your head. You spit a glob of blood before continuing.\n\n\n \n\n\u201cHa ha, go ahead shit eater. Pop me and they\u2019ll be nobody to run the computer the right way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get by.\u201d a voice says.\n\n\nYou then are shot twice in the back of the head.

You were even defending this place, he didn\u2019t seem like he had good plans for the shelter and its inhabitants.\n\nSending Ron and William into exile wasn\u2019t your fault\u2026well not really. You were just obeying goddamn orders. You tried to talk Nina out of it when nobody else had the balls to stand up to her. She wasn\u2019t budging. What the fuck were you supposed to do?

They don\u2019t have a problem with it, they tell you just to come back and let them know when you\u2019re ready.\n\nYou go back to your room and load up on water and that crap they call \u201cfood\u201d from the dispensers. Then you enter the medical room and begin taking medical supplies. When you think you\u2019re ready, you go back and tell Todd and Charles. Charles opens the elevator door and wishes you luck, Todd talks to you on your way there.\n\n\u201cSo you sure about this?\u201d\n\u201cVery sure, in fact I\u2019m not sure why more people aren\u2019t wanting to leave with Nina bullying everyone.\u201d\n\nSpeak of the devil. Nina arrives with her goon Leon. Shit, you were hoping to avoid this.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about me being a bully? And where the fuck do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Nina exclaims.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving Nina, you of all people should be happy about it, I won\u2019t be around to piss you off anymore or threaten your power.\u201d\n\u201cWell as much as I\u2019d like you to leave, I admit you\u2019re needed here so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you leave and even if you were to leave I can\u2019t just let you take vital shelter supplies! Go put those back and get back to your post NOW!\u201d\n\u201cNina, you\u2019re not calling the fuckin\u2019 shots on this, I\u2019m going! I\u2019m not you\u2019re goddamn prisoner! And if the rest of you are smart the rest of these people would stop cowering before you. But hey what do I know?\u201d\n\nYou start to enter the elevator, and Nina makes another threat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you DARE walk away from me! You go in that elevator and don\u2019t expect to get to the top! I\u2019ll make sure it gets stopped mid-way through and leave it there for you to die a slow death!\u201d\n\nYou step back out and hang your head down.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) You WOULD do that wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYou bet your ass I would!\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess I have no choice.\u201d\n\nYou look up at Nina, raise your pistol and blast Leon twice in the chest and then point it at her.

Somebody or possibly several people were here at one time attempting to get in, you laugh thinking about someone actually trying to get in this place.\n\nYou exit the foyer and go outside, you see a bright light. It\u2019s the sun; you forgot how bright it could be. You see everyone\u2019s cars still parked here, well almost. You can tell that few of them must\u2019ve been taken at one time; a lot have just been plain vandalized. Your van still looks the same though, nobody in their right mind would steal that thing, and it already looks vandalized.

William and Ron are still recovering from their beating and staggering in the doorway of the elevator.\n\nNina stops you just for a moment to address everyone. \u201cThe exile is off, everyone go back to your lives\u2026and YOU are coming with me!\u201d then she starts pulling you back to her room.\n\nYou and Nina relieve a lot of pent up sexual energy that day. A lot of things change after that\u2026\n\n\nFour more years pass...\n\nYou and Nina are an item now, which makes you somewhat more social by necessity (unfortunately) its not all bad though since she\u2019s the one that\u2019s still shelter leader and has to do all the major work. She does a good job hence the reason she\u2019s stayed in power. (Though not surprisingly William and Ron still vote against her, even if she did apologize)\n\nYou\u2019re now in charge of maintaining the central GZS computer system which you insist on doing primarily by yourself, though Charles and Todd assist you sometimes. Eventually you manage to get the damn thing running at near maximum efficiency and nobody has too many problems with things breaking down anymore.\n\nThe Shelter\u2019s population has grown a bit now; the only good thing about the shelter was the design to make allowances for a population growth. Of course now there\u2019s rug rats running around which means Nina appoints a person to start being a \u201cteacher\u201d of sorts for when they start getting bigger. Fortunately there are a couple of those already in the shelter. Kyle and Brenda are now the main medical practitioners, though you doubt if they\u2019d be able to do open heart surgery, they\u2019re competent enough to keep people in relatively good shape and they keep trying to learn more whenever possible with the medical database provided and from books. (You still don\u2019t understand WHY you\u2019re the only competent tech though! \u201cGah! Read the books! Study the schematics! It\u2019s not difficult!\u201d you\u2019re constantly saying and that\u2019s to Charles and Todd!)\n\nThen there\u2019s the elevator. After the near exile incident, it was still considered a good idea to have it accessible at all times just in case. What you eventually did was install a call button and did some re-wiring to do just that, though nobody has ever dared to actually go up to the surface. (And nobody\u2019s ever gotten thrown out either)\n\nYou begin to wonder what the surface looks like now though from time to time.\n\nOne night while lying next to Nina\u2026\n\n\u201cHey Nina, you ever wonder what\u2019s on the surface now?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s probably an uninhabitable wasteland.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe, but we\u2019ve been down here five years, it might look different.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and it might not. Go back to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I just thought about it, everyone\u2019s vehicles are up there. I bet we could strip them down for parts or something, maybe some of them will even work. We could drive around and see what\u2019s going on else where.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t want you going up there! The elevator is a last resort thing just case something bad happens! And since when do you want to play great explorer? When you first got here you never left your room!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, maybe your socialization has made me a little more extroverted.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, knowing you, you probably just want to get away from the increasing population here.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, maybe. But I still wouldn\u2019t mind just taking a quick look outside, and to inspect the vehicles like I said.\u201d\n\nNina now sits up.\n\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want you going up there! There\u2019s probably radiation still all over the place! I don\u2019t want you getting radiation poisoning or mutating or something!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine! I won\u2019t go too far, I just want to\u2026\u201d\n\nNina grabs a hold of your hand.\n\n\u201cNO! I don\u2019t want you going up there! It\u2019s not safe!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, calm down. I won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, I don\u2019t want to hear anymore about it. Our life is here, not up there. I love you too much to lose you.\u201d\n\nThe both of you lie back down, and Nina holds on to you tightly, putting her head on your chest almost in an effort to make sure you\u2019re not going anywhere tonight.\n\nOf course now you\u2019re lying awake REALLY wondering what the surface looks like.\n\nThe next day you\u2019re working with Charles and Todd doing the usual mundane routine. They\u2019re talking about the same stupid movie they\u2019ve watched over and over in the community living area. Shit you feel like you\u2019re at work again. The GZS central computer hasn\u2019t been giving you trouble for quite some time, and you know there\u2019s a big meeting going on in the conference room\u2026\n\nMaybe you could sneak out and just take a quick look on the surface for awhile. You could let Charles and Todd look after the computer, you know they\u2019re capable of doing that.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go up to the surface", "result": "The temptation is too great, you have to go. You\u2019re just too curious not to.\n\n\u201cHey Todd, and Charles I think you guys are ready to monitor this thing by yourself. I didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night, and I\u2019m going back to my room to take a short nap, don\u2019t tell anyone alright?\u201d\n\nTodd and Charles just look glad that you\u2019re showing some confidence in them for once.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure it\u2019s cool. We won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Todd says.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be back. Remember just monitor, don\u2019t fucking touch anything!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Got it!\u201d\n\nYou leave the computer room and look around; the shelter almost seems eerily empty right now. Nina\u2019s no doubt got everyone\u2019s attention with her speech in conference room and all the kids are being looked after by someone in the children\u2019s room created a couple years back.\n\nYou make your move. You run to the elevator, open it and get inside. You take a deep breath and press the button up, no time like the present to test it person.\n\nThe elevator begins its ascent, you begin to wonder what you\u2019ll see above, you then check you pistol just in case what you see is unfriendly. Finally the elevator opens up to the same foyer you entered five years ago. Looks exactly the same, except the payment machine is now offline in fact the screen is cracked. There\u2019s a crowbar lying on the floor and the doors to the outside look like they were pried open. You see the outside world for the first time in five years. From where you\u2019re standing, it doesn\u2019t look too bad; maybe the devastation wasn\u2019t that great in this area. Somebody or possibly several people were here at one time attempting to get in.\n\nYou take the crowbar and jam it in the elevator door so it doesn\u2019t close on you. There\u2019s no call button up here either since it was the payment machine that opened it up. You make a note that if you\u2019re able you\u2019ll have to install another one up here, and shake your head at the typical shitty GZS design of its shelters. They built this thing like a high tech mass coffin as far as you\u2019re concerned; you\u2019re convinced that if it wasn\u2019t for you up keeping and tinkering, everyone would\u2019ve been dead due to shelter failure by now.\n\nYou exit the foyer and go outside, you see a bright light. It\u2019s the sun; you forgot how bright it could be. You see everyone\u2019s cars still parked here, well almost. You can tell that few of them must\u2019ve been taken at one time; a lot have just been plain vandalized. Your van still looks the same though, nobody in their right mind would steal that thing, and it already looks vandalized. You wonder if it would still start, but you left your keys to it in the shelter. You doubt if it would though.\n\nIt occurs to you for the first time, the shelter might not exactly be \u201csafe\u201d, granted its not safe by design, but you\u2019re thinking safe from bad people on the surface. Its possible these folks who passed through here stealing vehicles and vandalizing them might\u2019ve just been trying to scavenge whatever they could find. The surface certainly can\u2019t be a comfortable place to live now. Maybe they were just looking for safety. Of course it\u2019s equally likely they were looters and other bad types.\n\nThe shelter community isn\u2019t exactly a bunch of \u201cwarriors\u201d, besides yourself, Leon, and maybe a few others you doubt it they could handle a bunch of hardened surface raiders who\u2019ve been living in the wasteland for years. Granted the elevator wouldn\u2019t allow for a large invasion of these types of people to take place, but it still makes you wonder if precautions shouldn\u2019t be taken.\n\nYou need to get back though before everyone finds out what you\u2019ve been doing. You rush back to the elevator (Throwing the crowbar back on the ground) and take it down hoping that nobody is wandering around when you exit the thing.\n\nWhen you arrive at the bottom, you half expect to see a crowd to meet you, but its dead silent still, you quickly head back to the computer room where Charles and Todd are talking about another movie.\n\n\u201cHey you\u2019re back. So what did you see on the surface?\u201d Charles asks\n\u201cYeah were there mutants and shit?\u201d Todd adds\n\nYou\u2019re a little taken aback.\n\n\u201cWhat?! How did you guys know?\u201d\n\u201cSheesh! Come on, we\u2019re not the morons you think we are! You told us to monitor the computer system, and when you used the elevator, the computer mentioned the elevator was in use, we put two and two together. So how was it? Is it all desert and shit with people dressed in leather walking around?\u201d\n\nYou nearly slap yourself in the head for forgetting that little oversight on your part.\n\n\u201cYou watch too many movies Charles; no I didn\u2019t see any of that. At least not in the immediate area. And YOU two don\u2019t know I went up there and I mean you don\u2019t tell ANYONE! If Nina found out, she\u2019d a pitch a bitch at me. She\u2019s already made it clear that she doesn\u2019t want me going up on the surface.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019re not going to say anything. I dunno, I think maybe we should start going to the surface though, I mean this place can\u2019t support a growing population forever. Eventually we\u2019re going to have to start expanding out.\u201d Todd mentions.\n\u201cYeah, but that probably won\u2019t be for awhile, we a got a lot of room still. Lots of supplies too, and with us in charge the food and water dispensers are working perfectly now.\u201d Charles retorts.\n\nYou roll your eyes \u201cWith us in charge\u201d actually it was you who made sure the damn things wouldn\u2019t be breaking down on a regular basis. Still Todd makes a good point and it was something you were thinking about too. Maybe you should address this further with Nina after all her being the shelter leader she\u2019s the one that could enact a plan about it.\n\nLater that night, you\u2019re in bed with Nina wondering if its time to tell her she should think about expansion\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Let it go", "result": "No, you better just keep it to yourself. You don\u2019t want Nina getting pissed at you, you know how high strung she\u2019s able to get sometimes. Besides the population isn\u2019t growing that much yet, there are plenty of supplies. If someone gets the idea that going to the surface is necessary, you\u2019re sure that someone else will bring it up. No point in you getting in trouble. You go back to sleep and just hope Charles and Todd keep quiet about your little excursion to the surface.\n\nA few weeks later you find out Nina\u2019s pregnant, now you start to wonder about having enough room in the future. You still don\u2019t bring it up, because you don\u2019t want to upset Nina anymore in her \u201ccondition\u201d.\n\nAfter Jack is born, the surface thing is still in the back of your mind, but now it\u2019s been so long, you just feel it\u2019s easier not to address it to Nina. So you don\u2019t say anything.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nTen years have passed and the shelter is starting to get a little crowded. After all there isn\u2019t too much to do in the shelter that hasn\u2019t already been done, so sex is always (as it always has been) a popular way to pass the time. The result of that fun activity is too many babies.\n\nAt this point now you say something to Nina about the surface, she\u2019s a little reluctant about the idea, but sees that it might be necessary. Unfortunately the rest of the council doesn\u2019t see it that way. Many of them have been here so long now that going to the surface is almost unthinkable. Despite great protest Nina overrides the council\u2019s advise and goes ahead with the plan anyway. This doesn\u2019t make her too popular.\n\nFor one reason there\u2019s the decision of who is suppose to live on the surface, many people have full blown families now, they\u2019re a little unwilling to risk taking them up. So that means the single or childless people get the boot upstairs since they have less to \u201close\u201d. That doesn\u2019t go over too well either. People start protesting loudly about being kicked out of their homes since they have as much right to stay too.\n\nOne day, you\u2019re in the computer room at the time arguing with Charles who happens to be single, and giving you shit about Nina\u2019s new policy. Todd is pretty much indifferent to the idea since even though he\u2019s single he doesn\u2019t mind the idea of going to the surface, he just thinks you should\u2019ve said something to Nina a long time ago to implement this plan sooner before everyone had a whole mess of babies. \n\nThat\u2019s when you get the word.\n\nKyle comes in to tell you that during one of Nina\u2019s speeches William (Who would\u2019ve been one of those kicked up to the surface along with Ron) attempted to assassinate Nina with a scalpel he stole from the medical supplies. Leon managed to stop him with extreme prejudice by breaking his neck. But its not ending there, people are starting to riot and call for someone new to be the shelter leader.\n\nYou\u2019re pissed off now, you storm into the conference room ready to kick everyone\u2019s ass who DARES to try to hurt Nina again. You fire your pistol into the air causing everyone to take notice. When you get over to Nina, she\u2019s pleading for you to not shoot anybody. The assassin was already taken care of; there isn\u2019t any more need for killing.\n\nWhile that might be the case that still doesn\u2019t solve the problem of everyone hating Nina (And probably you too as well) if she gets thrown out of her position, the next step might be to try to throw you guys out of the shelter.\n\nPart of this you feel is your fault, you could just roll the dice here or you could attempt to take the hard line approach.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let democracy run its course", "result": "\u201cAlright Nina, we\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d You put your pistol away and take Nina back to your room for the rest of the day.\n\nTime goes by and Nina gets voted out. The position of shelter leader is eliminated and a council is formed instead. They begin to implement some changes. Nina\u2019s idea of having people live on the surface is squashed, the idiots in charge claim that everything will be all right and only in cases of extreme punishment will people be sent to the surface. The other change is that you are to work less on the computer system.\n\nAnd so it begins, they\u2019re trying to faze you out, so they don\u2019t need you anymore. And if they don\u2019t need you anymore they can kick you out of the shelter. (It looks like you are going to be the only people deemed \u201ccriminal\u201d enough to be exiled to the surface) You saw this coming.\n\nThat\u2019s the second time you anticipated events and did nothing, you could kick yourself.\n\nHowever there\u2019s still the question of them trying to MAKE you leave, you are the one that owns the gun after all and not one person has ever dared to try to take it from you. You decide to start working out on a regular basis just in case.\n\n\nThat day comes soon, when a couple people attempt to wrestle it from you, fortunately you\u2019ve been expecting that, you end up shooting them both dead. People are really starting to hate you now, threats are being made that if you and your family don\u2019t leave, then not you, but Nina and Jack are going to suffer the consequences.\n\nYou respond with a similar threat of your own that if anything happens to either of them that you\u2019re going on a postal shooting spree starting with everyone\u2019s kids and won\u2019t stop until you\u2019re out of bullets, and then you\u2019ll fuck up the central computer that powers everything in the shelter. Given your past, people believe you too. People stop harassing you and Nina, but they still \u201cshun\u201d you 99 percent of the time.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter though since as more years go by there\u2019s even less room in the shelter, and less supplies, now you\u2019re not even charge of the computer system anymore and it\u2019s barely being run properly by Todd and Charles. Things are starting to break down again. You\u2019re seriously starting to think about leaving the shelter voluntarily.\n\n\u201cNina, let\u2019s leave. Surely there\u2019s gotta be something better out there. I mean staying here is like waiting to die. We gotta get out of this place.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about Jack? I mean we\u2019re going into unknown territory here. Things could be dangerous up there.\u201d\n\u201cIt probably will be dangerous, but what the hell we\u2019ve been living in an enclosed space with a bunch of people who hate us for years, and both experienced death attempts. Its not like we\u2019re strangers to it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026shouldn\u2019t we at least stay until the very end?\u201d\n\u201cIf we stay until the very end, we might not be getting outta here because by the time everyone\u2019s crammed in so tight with no more supplies or properly functioning equipment, everyone\u2019s going to be panicking and rioting. No, we need to leave while the getting is good. You and Jack start packing up all your vital stuff. I\u2019ll be loading up on some supplies that we might need. We still need to travel light, but make sure you and Jack bring as much water as you can carry.\u201d\n\nSoon you, Nina and Jack are ready to go. Everyone\u2019s wondering what you\u2019re doing and then all eyes are on you when you open the elevator door. You take a moment to address the huddled masses.\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019re leaving now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all as glad about it as we will be. Before we leave though I\u2019d just like to say a few things. If any of you fucktards have a lick of sense you\u2019ll abandon this over priced coffin, and coffin is definitely an accurate term with how cramped it\u2019s getting in here. Hell the place is even starting to smell like one, with all the shower break downs. Its like watching something slowly die\u2026hmm I think I saw that show already, when the world got blown to shit years ago. Don\u2019t need to see it again and the first time was more interesting anyway, so enjoy your downward spiral experience losers!\u201d\n\nAnd with that you and your family leave the shelter.\n\nAs you look out before the wilderness in front of you, you can only hope there\u2019s something else out there, but even if there isn\u2019t you know you\u2019ll make it somehow.\n\nYou and your family begin to walk\u2026", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Take control", "result": "You said nothing when you should have about the surface five years ago. That was your fault. You can do something now though. Something unpopular and drastic, but something that will better ensure the safety of your family.\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m doing something I should\u2019ve done a long time ago! I\u2019M taking over!\u201d\n\u201cYou? Says who?! What gives you the right?!\u201d someone in the crowd shouts.\n\nYou point your pistol in his direction.\n\n\u201cTHIS! Is what gives me the fuckin\u2019 right bitch! My willingness to allow you to continue your goddamn existence! Now here\u2019s how things are gonna go down.\u201d\n\nYou begin to implement new changes whether anyone likes them or not, and most folks don\u2019t, but as usual you don\u2019t give a shit.\n\nYou keep Nina\u2019s plan for the surface idea, one of the things you do is install another call button so the elevator can now go up and down without all the extra hassle of fucking with the computer anymore, you still don\u2019t know what the fuck GZS was thinking about with that idea of fucked up engineering. Parts of the shelter begin to get stripped along with some of the vehicles still remaining outside to create a few small homes.\n\nAs for who is going up to live, you devise a random numbering system that everyone has to participate in\u2026of course you\u2019ve purposely rigged it so your family doesn\u2019t have to live up there. You\u2019ve also rigged it so certain \u201cuseful\u201d members don\u2019t have to live up there either making them a little more receptive to your changes. Charles and some others are suddenly pleasant with you again. Naturally everyone who does have to leave hates your guts.\n\nYour next step is to send out \u201cexplorers\u201d to go find other communities to contact and trade with, because you desperately need more supplies. You pick Leon for the task, but Todd also volunteers. Brenda wants to go too, but you need all the people with medical knowledge here in the shelter.\n\nA few weeks later Leon and Todd come back from their explorations. They mention they came across a place called Ashtown. They say it\u2019s a small town, but willing to trade since they have routine problems with raiders and wouldn\u2019t mind a supply of fresh water for a change.\n\nNina doesn\u2019t exactly approve of your methods, but she goes along with you, because she loves you and you\u2019re actually getting something accomplished.\n\nFive more years pass...\n\nThings have changed quite a bit, for better and for worse.\n\nYou\u2019re running the shelter and its now above town called \u201cExile\u201d basically by yourself and its putting you on edge each and everyday. One thing you didn\u2019t think about when finding a trading partner, was the fact that more weapons might be coming in. You now aren\u2019t the only person here with a gun. Which has lessened your intimidation value a bit, but you\u2019ve countered a full blown rebellion by turning the \u201csheltered\u201d and the \u201cunsheltered\u201d against each other. The people who live in the shelter are of course a lot more well off and healthier, while those living on the surface now suffer from the elements and the occasional mutant wolf pack attack.\n\nThe haves vs. the have nots. It\u2019s an old tale that\u2019s been played over and over. A tale that resulted in Armageddon, and now apparently even beyond it.\n\n\nBut even you cannot prevent an unstable powder keg from exploding forever and one day it does. Full blown rioting breaks out, you attempt to squash the rebellion, but it\u2019s not even a rebellion so much as it is full blown anarchy as people IN the shelter are attempting to kill you in the opportunity to attempt to take over. Damn, you really thought Leon was on your side too.\n\nYou end up having to shoot your way out of the conference room, and make it back to your room where Nina is barricaded with Jake, she opens the door long enough to let you in.\n\n\u201cWe have to get out of here!\u201d she screams. \u201cIt\u2019s over!

They WILL fall in fuckin\u2019 line!\n\nUnfortunately like most people under a dictatorship, they don\u2019t see you as a great savior but rather as the tyrant you are. Eventually a group of the surface people come down en-masse and overrun the place, you try to prevent more from coming by barricading yourself in the computer room and shutting off the elevator, but its too late, there are already a lot of them down here. There\u2019s no way you can fight all of them, you don\u2019t have the ammo and all your loyal guards are dead. You and your family are trapped and you know what they\u2019ll do to all of you if they take you alive, you look at Nina and Jack\u2026\n\nNope, you\u2019re still in control of some things around here. You take a deep breath and look directly into Nina\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cKnow that I always loved you\u2026the both of you.\u201d you say sadly.\n\nThen without any further hesitation you shoot them both in the head.\n\nAfter wiping a tear from your eye, you start paying attention to the threats outside your door.\n\n\u201cGet outta there you sonofabitch!

SCORCHED FUCKIN\u2019 EARTH BITCHES!\u201d\n\nYou start shooting the GZS central computer, lighting starts flickering and eventually you hit the right vital spot and the entire shelter\u2019s power goes dead. Immediately you hear some shouting from behind the door, and they begin blasting it open. Won\u2019t be long now.\n\n\nYou fire at the first figure that you can barely make out in the darkness, then the rest open fire on you. You see the flash of multiple muzzle blasts and then fall to the ground near Nina\u2019s body.\n\nIn your last moments, you grab onto Nina\u2019s hand and squeeze before darkness takes you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run while you can", "result": "\u201cI\u2019ll go with that idea, but we\u2019re gonna have to be quick! Grab only the basic necessities. We\u2019re going to Ashtown.\u201d\n\n You and your family grab what you need and run for the elevator which fortunately is still on the bottom. A couple of guards still loyal accompany you. When you arrive to the surface you nearly get your head blown off as soon as the elevator door opens. Your guards shoot the would be killer and you all move on.\n\nOutside the shelter entrance it\u2019s even worse. There\u2019s fighting all over the place, and as soon as people see you, they all start trying to kill you. You urge Nina and Jack to run for the wilderness immediately. You fire back at the angry mob moving on your position, while running at the same time. The last of your guards go down. You run to attempt to catch up to Nina and Jack, which you do, but the mob is still chasing you. A bullet whizzes by your ear and then you hear a scream, its Nina.\n\nYou turn around and think she\u2019s been hit, but it was Jack who was hit. She goes back to retrieve his body. Of course the mob isn\u2019t stopping.\n\n\u201cNINA! NO!\u201d you shout and fire at the mob, but killing a few of them doesn\u2019t stop them from shooting Nina, who falls by Jake\u2019s body. There\u2019s nothing you can do now. You continue to run until you eventually lose your pursuers. Then you weep for the loss of your family.\n\nYou wander the wasteland for a bit, hoping something will attack you and put you out of your misery, but you never encounter a thing. Eventually you make your way to Ashtown. You get a couple of strange looks. A few people from Ashtown have heard descriptions of you, but never actually met you in person.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, not at all, you got any work around in this dump?\u201d\n\n\nThe citizens of Ashtown have a few old generators that they need working at maximum efficiency, so that\u2019s what you work on. They\u2019re so grateful for your technical expertise, that they keep quiet about you being here, the next time a group of people from the shelter come to trade. Things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to well at the shelter from what you can tell though, word has it, that they\u2019re going to have to completely abandon the shelter itself and live completely on the surface now, apparently the shelter\u2019s computer system was severely damaged and is libel to shut down at any moment. The people are miserable and the baby mortality rate is high\n\nThis gives you no joy however, you\u2019ve lost more. Much more. The solitude you once cherished and have again now only feel like emptiness. One day during a raider attack you purposely go out and fight them along with all the other defenders. You get yourself shot in the stomach and you don\u2019t even care as you lie dying, anything to end your suffering.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Address it", "result": "\u201cHey Nina get up.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, what? Not tonight I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s about the surface. I think we need to start taking precautions and possible steps to expand above. The surface doesn\u2019t look that bad and\u2026\u201d\n\nNina immediately sits up.\n\n\u201cYOU WENT TO THE SURFACE? After I told you not to fucking do that?! YOU ASSHOLE!\u201d\n\u201cCalm down look you can see nothing happened to me. It doesn\u2019t even look like there was any bombs that landed anywhere near the area.\u201d\n\u201cYou could be radiated! The wind blows your know or have you forgotten? Or maybe it was a biological weapon! A disease could be floating in the air! You ever think of that? You could be infected with god knows what right now and spread it to the whole shelter! And our baby!\u201d\n\nAnother surprise.\n\n\u201cBaby? You\u2019re pregnant?\u201d\n\u201cI just found out recently from Brenda a few days ago. I was going to tell you soon, I should\u2019ve told you yesterday before you went to the surface, but I THOUGHT you respected my wishes! I can\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201d\n\nNina gets up and starts pacing. She\u2019s very upset. You get up and try to fix this mess.\n\n\u201cLook that just makes this idea even more vital, this place can\u2019t support all these people having babies. Even GZS mentioned in their delusional guideline statement it was the intention for people to eventually go back up to the surface and repopulate it with their families. We can\u2019t live like a bunch of crowded sardines; we should make preparations now, before it becomes a problem.\u201d\n\u201cBut it might be dangerous up there.\u201d\n\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be a picnic, but that\u2019s another reason why we should start getting ready now. The more we\u2019re prepared the better off we\u2019ll be to defend ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cBut the radiation\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, the fact remains this place IS going to get overpopulated one day and people are going to have to start going up to the surface and any background radiation isn\u2019t going to disappear within that time. So we\u2019re just going to have to roll the dice and deal with that fact. Like I said I think we\u2019re okay, we\u2019re in a fairly isolated area away from an important major city. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re located on either of the coasts which were probably bombed the shit out of. And to the response to biological weapon thing, I highly doubt those were used, we were the only country that had the capability to launch such weapons from a long distance, except maybe Russia and I\u2019m sure they probably just used nukes on us. Besides any virus or germ used in such a way would\u2019ve died out long ago after it killed off the immediate population.\u201d\n\nNina still doesn\u2019t look so sure, she still look worried about you. You hold Nina to reassure her.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019ll make you feel better I\u2019ll actually go see Kyle and have him check me out. And you know how much I hate going to see doctors, especially one that\u2019s got all his knowledge from the GZS info files. I\u2019ll be here for a long time\u2026 for all of us.\u201d\n\nYour words seem to relax her a bit. She smiles and embraces you more closely.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bring it up tomorrow\u2026I still think it\u2019s funny that you of all people would be advocating going back to the surface.\u201d\n\u201cPfft! WE\u2019RE not going to the surface to live. We\u2019re staying here! I just want get the rest of these fuckers out of the shelter and on to the surface! This place is too damn crowded as it is!\u201d\n\u201cNow that sounds more like you!\u201d Nina laughs.\n\nFive more years pass\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since you got here. It almost seems surreal to think about. Nina\u2019s still the shelter leader and you\u2019re still looking after the central computer. However a lot more things have changed, and just as predicted the population grew significantly, fortunately the implementations ahead of time allowed everyone to adjust with little problems.\n\nThere was some apprehension at first when Nina first suggested the surface thing, but eventually people did see the point in it. Some even wanted to go up to the surface. The first step was to make a fully functioning elevator that people could go up AND down on without any problems. (Of course that job fell to you again)\n\nThe next step was to create small \u201chuts\u201d with the cars outside as well as using current shelter material. This went quicker than expected as most people pitched in to help.\n\nNina gave birth to a son Jack, and almost went back to her duties immediately, leaving you to do most of the \u201cMr. Mom\u201d work. Nowadays you split your time between monitoring the computer and monitoring Jack. Thankfully Charles and Todd have learned a lot more now and don\u2019t require your supervision lessening your workload.\n\nNow its time for the next step.\n\nNina and her council have been discussing plans for the even farther future. Contact with others and exploration. Within the past five years of the return to the surface, there has been contact with a few wanderers here and there, but they tended not to talk too much about their travels, they just mentioned that they\u2019d seen other evidences of civilization, not all very civilized of course. Most of them just seemed to want to keep moving after doing a bit of trading and resupplying. One even hinted at some other \u201cthings\u201d lurking around on the surface which didn\u2019t sound too promising.\n\nHowever, the shelter needs to start finding a stable trading partner, or at least a place to find more supplies, because the vital ones are starting to run out. Some people are asked to volunteer for this exploration mission\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising Leon volunteered, but Brenda and Todd also volunteered. They were given as much supplies as they could carry and armed with the most \u201cdangerous\u201d things in the shelter. Leon and Todd carry some crowbars and Brenda carries a scalpel. You wonder if that\u2019s really going to be enough though. Chances are some people out there (Quite possibly a lot) are carrying guns on them. Todd and Brenda aren\u2019t going to be much good in a fight anyway, and while Leon is a fighter, even he can\u2019t stop a bullet.\n\nYou\u2019re the only one with an \u201cequalizer\u201d around here. Maybe you should hand it over to them to give them a better chance. Though you really don\u2019t want to do that, for various reasons.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hand over your pistol", "result": "Before they leave you approach Leon, you and he still have a bit of history over the whole Elliot thing years ago. You\u2019re guessing he\u2019s not one to hold a grudge though since he\u2019s never sought any type of revenge or something. You only hope he isn\u2019t the patient type.\n\n\u201cAlright Leon, I know you\u2019re the fighter of this group, and I know its most likely going to be dangerous up there, so I\u2019m gonna do something totally out of character. I\u2019m giving you my pistol and the two clips I have. It\u2019s in good condition, and it\u2019s only been fired once in ten years and I think you know when that was. Here you go.\u201d\n\nLeon takes the gun and looks at it with silence for awhile and then speaks. You think this is the first time you\u2019ve actually heard him speak at all!\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, I never did apologize for that shit ten years ago. I dunno what the hell I was thinking following Elliot; none of us who did do. You and Nina have done a better job of keeping this place running than anyone. Anyway, this is really generous of you, but I can\u2019t shoot worth shit, but I know someone who\u2019s going with us who used to practice regularly before the bombs dropped. Hey Brenda! I got something for ya!\u201d\n\nBrenda comes over and her eyes widen when Leon hands her your pistol.\n\n\u201cAw yeah! This is what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about! I just hope I\u2019m still a good shot; I\u2019ve only been able to practice my aim by throwing this scalpel at a human diagram chart.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well don\u2019t practice too much with it, save your bullets for an emergency. I didn\u2019t know you were a gun person Brenda.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou really need to get out of that computer room and socialize more!\u201d\n\u201cShit, he barely socializes when he\u2019s in there with me and Charles.\u201d Todd adds.\n\u201cBut yeah I used to practice with my own when I had one. I was too afraid to try to sneak mine in here though\u2026you know we\u2019ve all always wondered about that, how DID you sneak this in?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\nYou just smile.\n\n\u201cHey I think you guys better get going.\u201d You say almost laughing\n\n\u201cOh come on! What a gyp! Alright, but we want to know when we come back!\u201d Brenda says and then her, Leon and Todd enter the elevator wave goodbye to everyone and go up.\n \nYou and everyone else go about your usual business. Nina mentions what you did.\n\n\u201cWow, that was really surprising for you, you\u2019ve practically been walking around with that thing on you for ten years.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I can only hope I don\u2019t need it within the time that they come back\u2026if they come back.\u201d\n\u201cYou just gave them an edge I\u2019d say they\u2019ve got more of a chance now. Don\u2019t be so pessimistic. They\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I hope. Bring Jack by the computer room later; I know you got some sort of meeting to go to.\u201d\n\u201cOh I can cancel that, it\u2019s not vital.\u201d\n\u201cNo its fine, bring him by. I\u2019ve been indoctrinating him on the basics of the shelter computer. Someone\u2019s gotta run this thing when I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\u201cWell alright then, hey don\u2019t worry. Everything will be alright.\u201d\n\nNina kisses you and you exchange remarks about how you love each other before you make your way back to the computer room. You know its silly to think about it, but you can\u2019t help thinking about some worst possible scenario.\n\nYou think about those three getting captured, tortured, and killed by a large group of psychotic bandits or something and then those same scum coming here because they found out the location after torturing them. You wouldn\u2019t have anything proper to defend your family with and the surface scum would probably have all kinds of weapons to kill everyone with. They\u2019d start by killing everyone in immediate area of the entrance, then they\u2019d come down in small groups with automatic weapons they undoubtedly have and start killing down here and worse\u2026\n\n\u201cHEY! Stop spacing!\u201d Charles suddenly says to you.\n\u201cHuh? Oh! Okay.\u201d You say snapping out your horrible daydream.\n\u201cMan, what\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019ve been doing that the whole time you got here.\u201d\n\u201cNothing, just a little pre-occupied.\u201d\n\nYou still don\u2019t really relax until Jack gets there, which allows you to think about less terrible things like teaching him about the computer system.\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished with your duties, you go back to your room, and Nina\u2019s there waiting for you looking as lovely as usual. You came in this place ten years ago with nothing except a bad attitude, now you got a lot more\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re not losing this. No way in hell.\n\nThe next day you start visiting the community gym area. You know other people like Leon use it. Nina uses it to keep in shape, but you\u2019ve never stepped foot in the place, you never really saw any reason to, its not like you were fat or anything, but you realize if some shit goes down you\u2019re going to have to be in better physical condition. You might not have a gun, but MAYBE you\u2019ll be quick and strong enough to take one away from somebody! You need a fucking edge. You begin training regularly. Nina\u2019s a little confused about this sudden change, but she\u2019s not at all displeased with it.\n\nYou do this for the next six months with the constant theme running in your mind of how you\u2019ll be able to take out the first miscreant that steps through the elevator, grab his gun and\u2026\n\n\u201cHey everyone, they\u2019re back! And they\u2019re in a fuckin\u2019 car with a shitload of stuff!\u201d someone shouts while you\u2019re training.\n\n\nYou immediately stop and head for the surface. When you arrive you see Leon unloading some stuff out of a beat up, but functioning car, he\u2019s got a patch on his eye now and his face is scarred, but otherwise looks okay. Brenda comes up to you and tosses you your pistol back, along with three clips!\n\n\u201cCame in handy, but I think I\u2019ll be using THIS from now on!\u201d Brenda pats an automatic rifle slung over her shoulder. \u201cHey, you look different, you been working out?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, something like that. So where did you get all this stuff?\u201d\n\u201cMost of it we got from this small place called Ashtown that\u2019s agreed to trade with us, we\u2019d found it after about a week of wandering around, we were there negotiating with them and they wouldn\u2019t trust us at first until the place suddenly got attack by a bunch of raiders. We helped defend the place from a one month siege! We also stuck around to help heal the wound. After that, they decided we were okay\u2026that was at sort of a high cost though. Todd didn\u2019t make it. He got killed in the fight. Tried to save him, but it was already too late by the time I got there.\u201d Brenda explains.\n\n\u201cDamn...he was an alright guy\u2026so is this fight where Leon got all scarred up?\u201d you say as he approaches.\n\u201cNo, that happened after we left Ashtown, we went exploring some more, we found another place a lot less friendly called The Combine. Trust me; we want to AVOID that place. We barely got out of there; we were basically prisoners. That\u2019s why we were gone for so long. However, that\u2019s where we got this car. We stopped back at Ashtown to pick up some supplies and came back here.\u201d Leon answers, then he looks at you with his remaining eye. \u201cDamn, you been working out?\u201d\n\nYou nearly start laughing at your situation, here you were training and thinking up every possible worst case scenario that was going to befall the shelter, while Brenda and Leon were actually engaged in some worst case scenarios. You\u2019re just glad that nothing did happen to the shelter, but you certainly feel less naked now that you have your \u201cequalizer\u201d back!\n\nLife in the shelter continues.\n\nTen more years pass\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve been here twenty years and as always there are more changes.\n\nMore people have moved to the surface, pieces of the shelter have been dismantled and started to be used to build a real town along with supplies from Ashtown, and scavenging from other places. Still, the shelter is needed to ensure at least a clean water supply so you\u2019re still running it. Nina\u2019s position has changed though. Since the shelter doesn\u2019t contain a majority of the population anymore, her position is more of a community council person and her title is no longer \u201cshelter leader\u201d. The place has been given a name now; New Haven\n\nOne current problem is to keep the place together, but with the younger population, they\u2019re less likely to want to stay. Ever since Leon came back with a giant mutant wolf head on one of his exploration trips, they all want to be \u201cexplorers\u201d too. Your son Jack being one of those young people.\n\nNina of course doesn\u2019t want him to go anywhere (You\u2019re reminded of when she didn\u2019t want you to go to the surface) and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re too fond of the idea either, but what can you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Increase his work time with you", "result": "The longer you can keep an eye on him the less likely he\u2019ll be sneaking off, maybe you can drum some discipline into his head again too, because apparently he lost some of it. You go to find Jake who\u2019s hanging around the edges of town as usual.\n\n\u201cHey Jack come here!\u201d\n\u201cAw Dad, I don\u2019t feel like working with you in the boring ol\u2019 computer room right now!\u201d\n\u201cBoy, you better get your ass to that computer room!\u201d\n\nJack follows you in defeat before you embarrass him anymore in front of his friends. When you arrive in the computer room Charles is there. Jack slumps down in a chair next to a console.\n\n\u201cOh hey there, I didn\u2019t expect to see you both here today.\u201d Charles says unsure of how he\u2019s suppose to respond to this situation.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well Jack needs to spend some extra time down here, he\u2019s been slackin\u2019 lately.\u201d\n\u201cI ain\u2019t been slackin\u2019!\u201d Jake protests.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been slackin\u2019! Now check the power systems!\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine! I dunno why we have to do this for; there hasn\u2019t been a problem with this thing for years.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s gonna STAY that way too! The only reason why we haven\u2019t had problems is because I\u2019m on top of things all the time! If I let this thing go to shit, no more clean water supply for us! Would you like that? Drinking piss water?\u201d\n\u201cI know I sure wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Charles mumbles.\n\u201cDamnit Dad this is boring! I don\u2019t wanna be doing this shit! I wanna go out an explore the world like Leon!\u201d\n\u201cLike Leon huh? In case you\u2019re blind, you\u2019ll notice Leon\u2019s got a missing eye, a missing left ear and pieces of his fingers. That\u2019s what the rest of the world does to you, if you slip up just slightly and nobody\u2019s perfect. Look at Brenda, she\u2019s the best marksperson in this place and she got herself shot in the leg which stopped her from going out. She now walks with a permanent limp! Is that what you want?\u201d\n\u201cGod you\u2019re a fucking control freak Dad! I thought Mom was bad, but\u2026\u201d\n\nOver the line. That one incurred Jack a wrap to the head.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY!\u201d you bellow as Jack holds his head.\n\u201cUm\u2026I think my shift is over, see ya later!\u201d Charles says getting out the way of this family squabble.\n\nThe rest of the time in the computer room is silent. Jack doesn\u2019t say anything, he just sullenly does what you tell him. The next day he does the same thing, and the day after that, and so on, until one day he doesn\u2019t. Mainly because he\u2019s run away with some of his friends and stolen Leon\u2019s beat up car. Nina is very distraught along with many other parents. The only thing is that Leon said it doesn\u2019t have that much gas in it because he hasn\u2019t been able to come across any lately.\n\nYou, some of the other fathers and Leon go looking for all of them. You first head towards Ashtown thinking that maybe they just went there to be \u201ca little rebellious\u201d. You come across the car, which they obviously abandoned, and continue to Ashtown with hope that Jack still headed that way, but no such luck. When you arrive, the people their say they haven\u2019t seen anyone come by in weeks.\n\nDays go by and at one point Leon thinks he\u2019s got a lead, but then the worst happens. You\u2019re attacked by crazed cannibals and their mutant dogs. You immediately tag one of the cannibals and duck behind a rock. But the cannibals also have guns and while the other fathers have weapons too, they haven\u2019t been practicing with them like you and Leon have. They\u2019re a lot better shots, you see a few of your fellow parents go down for the count, while the dogs finish them off. Leon holds his own, and you and he manage to take out all the cannibals, but it\u2019s the fucking dogs that give you trouble\u2026\n\nThree of them leap onto Leon, knocking his weapon from his hand, he sticks his thumbs in the eyes of the one that tried to take out his throat, but that still doesn\u2019t stop it from biting him in the face before it dies, one is chewing on his chest though and the other one is going to town on his crotch. You\u2019d try to help him, but you got one that came out of nowhere that rips into your leg. You shoot the damn thing in the head three times before it lets go. You then struggle to stand and shoot the other couple dogs, but its too late, Leon\u2019s a mangled corpse.\n\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d you shout in frustration looking at the dead all around you. You collapse to the ground and put your hands on your face thinking about how this got all fucked up and then that\u2019s when you notice the smoke coming from the cannibal camp and the smell of burning flesh. Your heart sinks and you drag yourself over for a closer look.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t let it\u2026\u201d you to yourself. You see some bones and clothing. Some on it looks like that of some of the other parent\u2019s kids. You don\u2019t see anything of Jack\u2019s. You don\u2019t know if he got away, or they ate him and threw the clothing elsewhere or what. Somehow it doesn\u2019t really matter; you haven\u2019t found him, so for all intents and purposes he\u2019s dead or at best; missing.\n\nAfter grabbing all the remaining water you can from the others you make the long painful journey back to New Haven, thinking about what you\u2019re going to tell everyone. Much has been lost this day.\n\nWhen you get back you collapse again, this time you feel a fever. Brenda and Kyle immediately see to you. It\u2019s your leg, its festering and infected from the mutant dog bite. Nothing can be done; you get it chopped off at the knee. The only good thing is you were unconscious at the time.\n\nAfter you get over the initially shock of waking up to a peg leg, you only have more bad news for everyone, especially Nina. However, many lives of husbands and children have been lost and someone MUST take the blame. And that someone happens to be you just because you happened to be the lucky one to come back alive.\n\nNina is voted out of her position on the council for some made up reason which you protest loudly, but it hardly bothers her since she\u2019s been preoccupied ever since you came back with the bad news. She holds on to sanity by making herself believe that Jack DID escape and is somewhere out there wandering the world.\n\nThey can\u2019t get rid of you so easily since even with Charles around you\u2019re still the only guy who can keep the computer system running everything working right, but most of the population sure gives you a hard time. If you weren\u2019t walking around on a fucking peg, you\u2019d start kicking some ass. As a few years goes by, finally you get sick of the shit and say:\n\n\u201cFuck it. Let \u2018em rot. They can run this shit themselves, this place is getting dead anyway. Nina, we\u2019re going to Ashtown.\u201d\n\u201cAshtown? But that\u2019s so far away! And you\u2019re walking on that peg!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean go right this minute or by ourselves, I meant the next trade caravan from Ashtown that comes by we\u2019re tagging along with it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to pick up and leave? Just like that? After all these years?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t like it either, but its obvious all of our efforts weren\u2019t ever appreciated here. Yours OR mine. Since they hate us so much, then let \u2018em live here without our help. There\u2019s nothing for us here now. All we got left is each other.\u201d\n\nNina agrees and holds you tightly while telling you how much she loves you.\n\nWhen the Ashtown caravan comes around you and Nina have all your stuff packed. They\u2019re only too happy to take you with them, since Ashtown has been trying to get a couple old generators working to maximum efficiency and they heard you were good at that sort of thing.\n\nYou spend your remaining life in Ashtown.

It\u2019s about all the talking you\u2019ve doing lately about exploring the wasteland like Indiana fuckin\u2019 Jones.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d Jack genuinely asks seeing as he\u2019s never heard of the movie being born after the bomb and all.\n\u201cIndiana\u2026look never mind that, your Mom worries night and day that you\u2019re going to go running off and get yourself killed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna run off\u2026I mean I thought about it\u2026but I just\u2026I dunno\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell spit it out boy!\u201d\n\u201cIt gets too boring here sometimes! I just wish I could go and explore the world like Leon!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well if you haven\u2019t noticed, Leon\u2019s missing an eye, his left ear and a couple of pieces of his fingers, not to mention he\u2019s all scarred up and complains about pain all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019D be more careful!\u201d Jack boasts.\n\u201cHmmm, that\u2019s what everyone says.  I know you and your friends think all the stories are exciting, but if you\u2019d really paid close attention you\u2019ll notice all damn danger as well. You know we\u2019ve lost a few people doing that adventure shit, and the only one who still does it is Leon. Even Brenda stopped going out after she got shot in the leg. She was lucky she managed to escape. The world isn\u2019t a safe place Jake. Never has been. And the way it is now, it\u2019s even more dangerous.\u201d\n\nJack looks at you.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here forever Dad.\u201d\n\nYou see it in his eyes that he\u2019s going to do what he wants and you aren\u2019t going to be able to stop him. You don\u2019t like it, and maybe you can\u2019t stop him, but you can improve his odds.\n\n\u201cAlright son, you gather all your little friends and meet me back here in a couple hours. Don\u2019t go anywhere! You hear me?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d\n\nYou go and find Nina and explain the situation, she\u2019s of course completely opposed to the idea and it takes some reasoning, but eventually she sees you have a point, even if she doesn\u2019t like it. You tell her to go inform the other parents; in the meantime you go and fetch Brenda and Leon.\n\nYou meet Jack who\u2019s standing around with a bunch of his other friends and most of the other young people in town. Brenda and Leon are behind you.\n\n\u201cAlright Jack, if exploration is what you want, you ain\u2019t gonna do it unprepared. You all know these two. Brenda here is going to teach all of you how to shoot properly. We\u2019ve got plenty of guns and ammo now and she\u2019s the best marksperson here. Before ANY of you people go out anywhere you better know how to aim your damn weapons. After a month of that, then you\u2019ll be going out, with Leon. He\u2019ll be able to give you on the job training with the whole explorer thing. In time, you\u2019ll be able to go out by yourselves. Now before any of this goes down, all of you are probably gonna have to discuss this with your parents or some shit, so you\u2019re all gonna have to work out your own personal lives yourselves, but Jack you\u2019ve got a reluctant okay from both me and your mother.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I dunno what to say, I mean thanks Dad.\u201d Jack smiles.\n\u201cWhat you can do is pay attention to Brenda and Leon\u2019s instructions and not get yourself killed! And here, take this. It\u2019s saved more than a few lives.\u201d You say and hand your pistol to Jack.\n\nAnd so begins the training. In time most of them go off to pursue their adventures elsewhere, naturally the world being what it is now, some don\u2019t return, but for those that do return most come back to stay permanently. Just a little bit of the taste of the outside world is all most of them needed to see it\u2019s a lot better to stay in New Haven! When Jake returns he\u2019s ready once again to follow in your footsteps.\n\n\u201cSee Nina, I knew my idea would work. Let \u2018em go out in the world for a little while and they\u2019ll come to appreciate the comforts of this place! Might be boring here, but at least you don\u2019t have some motherfucker with a Mohawk shooting at you because he likes the boots you got on. They just needed some training first to give them a chance to survive.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just glad Jack\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\nAs you and Nina breathe a sigh of relief that Jack\u2019s home in one piece, little did you realize that your idea set a major plan in motion.\n\nIn time, the New Haven Militia is created.\n\nThirty Years pass\u2026\n\n\nFifty years have gone by you briefly realize as you look at the old shelter entrance; it\u2019s hardly ever used anymore. Extensive changes have been made to it so it\u2019s rarely necessary to go down there anymore, only Jack and few other technicians go down there to check on the water purification system now in place. Practically everything else has been dismantled and used to help build up the surface of New Haven. New Haven has grown far beyond the shelter that you entered so long ago.\n\nYou don\u2019t think you ever saw this happening. Nobody did. The place is very large now; populated with the children of those you entered the shelter with as well as refugees from other places. Mostly everyone you originally knew is gone, not that you were ever one to greatly socialize, but still you do miss people like Leon, Brenda and Charles, hell you even miss Ron.\n\nYou especially miss your beloved wife Nina. It\u2019s been two years since she died. You miss her everyday. Jack comes by with his family to keep you company sometimes, but nowadays all you want is solitude.\n\nYou enter the shelter and go down the elevator. You probably aren\u2019t supposed to be down here, but you don\u2019t care, you\u2019re going to live in the past for awhile.\n\nYou walk around the practically gutted shelter and remember all the things that happened.\n\nHere\u2019s where you first met Nina, you never thought you\u2019d end up marrying and having a child with her someday, but even though you were annoyed by first impressions, (As she probably was with you!) you always thought she was beautiful.\n\nHere\u2019s where you shot Elliot. To this day you know you did the right thing. There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that things would\u2019ve been very different had he taken over.\n\nHere\u2019s where Jack was born. You remember Kyle having a hell of a time getting him to come out. He always could be a little stubborn. You just remembered you\u2019re supposed to have a check up appointment with Kyle\u2019s daughter Shelia. It can wait though; you\u2019re busy right now.\n\nAh now here it is. Your old room. You remember spending a majority of your initial time here. Still has the shelter manual on the table. You insisted that this room remain intact when the shelter was in the final stages of being stripped. You always knew you\u2019d return here some day.\n\nYou lie down on the bed and enjoy the peace and quiet from the surface. Slowly you begin to get drowsy.\n\n\u201cAhhh, so peaceful with no other people around\u2026I just wish Nina was here with me to enjoy it too\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as you drift off to sleep.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Keep it", "result": "No, you have to keep your weapon; you need something to be able to adequately defend your family in case the need should arrive.\n\nLeon, Brenda and Todd leave and life goes on\u2026until one month later.\n\n\nYou\u2019re on the surface one day spending time with Nina and Jack who is playing with the other children. It\u2019s a community event; nearly everyone is on the surface today. That\u2019s when you hear the sound of motorcycles. You look in the direction of the sound and see several approaching. The riders don\u2019t look like social types either. Everyone else on the surface begins to look too, and wondering what they should do. Nina quickly gathers up Jack.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run to the shelter", "result": "\u201cNina, we\u2019re getting in the shelter NOW!\u201d you grab her hand and run to the shelter entrance, upon seeing this others begin to follow your lead as the motorcycle rumble gets closer.\n\nYou Nina and Jack get in the elevator first, and everyone else starts to crowd inside unfortunately everyone is shoving and pushing to get in, but there simply isn\u2019t enough room not allowing the door to close.\n\n\u201cGET OUT! THE ELEVATOR CAN\u2019T CLOSE!\u201d You yell.\n\u201cFUCK YOU! YOU GET OUT!\u201d someone shouts back.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures\u2026\n\nYou pull your gun out and start shooting in the ceiling of the elevator, causing folks to run out.\n\u201cGET OUT! THIS IS OUR RIDE!\u201d you shout and push the door button, taking one last look of the frightened crowd as the doors close.\n\nOn the way down Nina holds on to Jack trying calm him down. She looks at you with silent disbelief. She can\u2019t believe you actually sacrificed all those people just like that, the men, the women, and the children.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that Nina! I did what I did to save us! This is fuckin\u2019 survival Nina! You know that!\u201d you retort.\n\nWhen the elevator reaches the bottom, Nina runs back to your room with Jack and you quickly get something to jam the door open, so the elevator can\u2019t go back up again. You see Charles come out from the computer room. He must\u2019ve been the only one down here to keep an eye on the computer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you blocking the elevator door?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re under fucking attack and I can\u2019t let those fuckers come down here!\u201d\n\u201cBut what about everyone else?! You can\u2019t just leave them up there! You\u2019re the only one with a proper weapon!\u201d\n\u201cHey that\u2019s tough! I mean I\u2019m sorry all those people are in deep shit right now, but that ain\u2019t my concern, my family is MY concern!\u201d\n\u201cYou heartless bastard! What about all the other families you left to probably die up there?! I always knew you weren\u2019t fond of people, but I never thought you\u2019d go to this extent! Well if you\u2019re not gonna do anything I will! Get outta my way, I\u2019m going up!\u201d\n\nYou shove Charles back hard.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you gonna do Charles? You ain\u2019t a fuckin\u2019 hero! This ain\u2019t like those old movies you watch! You\u2019re a fat outta shape fuck, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance! Shit you don\u2019t even have a weapon!\u201d\n\u201cWell gimme yours then!\u201d Charles says trying to take your pistol. You push Charles back even harder, when that doesn\u2019t work, you hit him with face with the butt of the gun causing him to fall back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even fuck around like that Charles.\u201d You warn pointing the pistol at him.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand you\u2019re being deadly serious here; he makes another attempt by charging at you. You shoot him three times before he falls dead at your feet.\n\nNina comes running from your room to see what\u2019s happened now, she\u2019s horrified. Your actions within the past few minutes have severely changed her view about you.\n\n\u201cHe was trying to go to the surface! I can\u2019t allow that, we have to remain down here where it\u2019s safe! Who knows how long those fuckers will stay around! I\u2019m trying to protect all of us!\u201d you shout.\n\nDays pass and things are strained between you and Nina. She doesn\u2019t approve at all of what you did. A lot of those people she was friends with. She says you did it purposely just so you could get more of your precious solitude and while that isn\u2019t true, you can\u2019t help but feel things are a lot better without anybody else around\u2026\n\nA year passes since the invasion, you used to keep an eye on the elevator door on a regular basis, but lately you haven\u2019t bothered. Nina has been distant with you ever since that day. Sometimes you\u2019re all right with each other, but more often than not you argue. If it wasn\u2019t for Jack, the both of you would probably just stay on opposite sides of the shelter.\n\nOne day you wake up and look for the both of them, but you can\u2019t find them anywhere then it suddenly occurs to you where they\u2019ve gone. To the surface. You immediately press the call button and shut \u201cCome on! Come on!\u201d at the elevator\u2019s slow descent. You do the same thing when you\u2019re going up.\n\nYou rush outside wondering where the hell Nina thinks she was off to, considering there\u2019s no knowledge of any beacons of civilization nearby. You figure she couldn\u2019t have gotten far and you\u2019re right, she\u2019s surveying the remains of the invasion. Everything that was built on the surface was destroyed, and it looks like nobody was spared. You see skeletal remains littered everywhere. She\u2019s crying while holding on to Jack and then speaks when she sees you.\n\n\u201cSee what you did!\u201d\n\u201cHey I didn\u2019t do THIS! The wasteland scum did this! What the hell Nina? I only have so many bullets, and I didn\u2019t even have my spare clips with me at the time! I couldn\u2019t shoot them all!\u201d\n\u201cOh, but you could shoot Charles right?\u201d\n\u201cNow that was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOr how about Elliot? Remember when you shot him and claimed it was self-defense?\u201d\n\u201cThat WAS Self-defense! Nina, you\u2019re acting like a stupid bit\u2026\u201d you stop yourself from completing that sentence, calm yourself and then continue. \u201cLook, I did what I did to protect us, I didn\u2019t want any of us getting killed. Let\u2019s all just go back inside the shelter and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGet your hands off of me! I\u2019m not going back in there with YOU! I can\u2019t stand to look at you anymore, even if it is a rarity nowadays!\u201d\n\u201cSo whadda ya gonna do Nina? Take Jack traipsing across the fuckin\u2019 wasteland and hope you don\u2019t get raped and killed before you die of dehydration? In case you haven\u2019t noticed, but this is IT! There probably ain\u2019t another place like this for miles! And if there is, I bet it damn near isn\u2019t as comfortable OR friendly! Look Jack needs the both of us here and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJack doesn\u2019t need YOU! You\u2019re barely spend time with him anyway! I can\u2019t do it anymore I can\u2019t spend one more day in that shelter with you after seeing what you did a year ago!\u201d\n\u201cNINA SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK IN THE GODDAMN SHELTER NOW!\u201d\n\nNow Jack begins to cry, and Nina attempts to make him stop, and now you see this situation isn\u2019t going to go away even if you dragged them both into the shelter kicking and screaming. Yet despite all this, you can\u2019t let Nina and Jack leave, you do the only other solution.\n\n\u201cOh fuck it. Here.\u201d You pull out your pistol and shove it into Nina\u2019s hand. She doesn\u2019t accept it at first until you force her take the thing. After she finally holds it, you start to leave. Nina calls out.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cOh now you show concern? I\u2019m leaving Nina, you said you can\u2019t live here with me since I now repulse you so much, so I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best and fuckin\u2019 leaving, because whether you believe it or not I do what\u2019s best for this family. I\u2019ll leave and probably die somewhere out in the wilderness or if you still have any kind of feelings for me, you\u2019ll save me a lingering death and just shoot me now. Either way, I\u2019m gone. Jack, take good care of your Mom, she gets a bit high strung at times. The computer\u2019s easy to run, just read the damn manual. That\u2019s what I always told everyone else. Both of you have a nice life.\u201d\n\nYou turn and begin to walk, you start wondering how long you\u2019re going to last without any kind of supplies, you didn\u2019t even bring a canteen with you. What does it all matter now anyway? Fuck it right?\n\nYou turn your head and see Nina and Jack just entering the shelter entrance. You shake your head, wondering where you went wrong. Where all the love went so damn quickly. Maybe she was right in some ways, maybe you were too ruthless. You just wanted to save them so badly though, you didn\u2019t want to lose them. Of course you did anyway.\n\nYou turn your head again, now you just see Nina. What the hell is she doing now? You hope to god she didn\u2019t have some change of mind suddenly. Because you know what\u2019s going to happen, she\u2019ll ask you to come back, and like an idiot you probably will, and then things will be semi-okay and then they\u2019ll get worse again and you\u2019ll be back to this again. At this point you don\u2019t feel like putting up with the shit anymore either. Just let it go Nina, just let it the fuck go. You made your decision now stick fuckin\u2019 by it.\n\nOnce more you turn your head; she\u2019s walking briskly towards you\u2026with your pistol in her hand. She has an unemotional look on her face. Reminds you of when she was going to throw Ron and his boy toy into exile that one time. You always knew she had a darker side to her, looks like its coming out one last time.\n\nYou slow down your walking so she can catch up to you quicker, until finally you stop altogether. You don\u2019t turn you head anymore; you want to make this easy on her.\n\nNow you feel the metal barrel to your head. Your last thought on this burned out world are:\n\n\u201cShe did still care.\u201d", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stand your ground", "result": "No way in hell you\u2019re going to hide, you\u2019re a good shot, (At least you used to be, you haven\u2019t practiced in awhile) you figure you can get enough of them, while taking cover and everyone else here doesn\u2019t have to be defenseless.\n\n\u201cEveryone grab some sort of weapon! Mothers grab your children and run to the shelter, when you get to the bottom jam the door open so it can\u2019t come back up!\u201d before she can even say anything you turn to Nina, \u201cNina! No arguments! Just do it!\u201d you then kiss her before she does what you say.\n\nThe bikes are getting closer. There\u2019s at least ten, each with a driver and a partner riding in the back. There\u2019s some sort of bloody head on the front of the first bike...its Leon\u2019s.\n\nYou can only guess the fate of Brenda and Todd were similar. Then you hear one of them yelling.\n\n\n\u201cYEEEHAAA! THERE IT IS! JUST LIKE THAT BITCH WE RAPED AND KILLED SAID! ATTACK!\u201d\n\nYou fire a couple times hitting a driver, the bike and its riders go flying into a couple other bikes. Not bad, in fact better than you expected. Unfortunately they\u2019re shooting at you now too. You duck for cover while everyone else does likewise, some getting shot in the process.\n\nThe remaining bikers attempt to circle around and open fire, but now everyone has adequate cover, so most of the bikers in the \u201cbitch seat\u201d get off to be a little more thorough.\n\nThe shelter people and the bikers clash. Not all the bikers have guns, but they\u2019ve been surviving on the road long enough to be better fighters. Many of your people are going down, and you\u2019re the only one who seems to be able to do any damage to these invaders. You manage to blast three more in the chest.\n\nSoon you\u2019re out of ammo, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. Some monster motherfucker starts attacking you with a spiked bat, landing it right in your leg. You punch him out before collapsing in pain. You attempt to pull the bat out, but then you\u2019re kicked in the face and thrown into the path of a speeding motorcycle which rides over your arm. You\u2019re not going anywhere; in fact the only thing that saves you from a follow up death blow is the fact that Nina and all the mothers come back up to the surface with weapons to help defend against the attack. Nina grabs your pistol which you dropped and loads it up with a clip you left down in the shelter and blasts the giant biker\u2019s brains out.\n\nSeeing many of there comrades dead and reinforcements arrive on your side, the remaining bikers sound a retreat and ride off. Much has been lost this day though; the shelter\u2019s population has severely been decimated, not to mention the confidence in staying on the surface.\n\nAfter this event, all ideas of rebuilding on the surface are abandoned. The shelter has more than enough supplies and room now for everyone considering this last attack. Of course that problem is only going to pop up again in the future when the population replenishes itself again. Maybe not in your lifetime, but certainly in Jack\u2019s. He can\u2019t stay here, he\u2019s going to have to go out in the world and learn how to deal with it. And you make sure he\u2019s better prepared than you were.\n\nYou stop Jake\u2019s training in learning about the computer system; it won\u2019t do him any good. Instead you make him do physical training in the shelter gym. You\u2019ve never used the thing, but he\u2019s sure going to. You can\u2019t directly train with Jake since you\u2019re basically crippled in one leg and arm, but you can motivate and that\u2019s what you do. Nina doesn\u2019t exactly like it, but she sees that one day the shelter is going to need someone to get more supplies.\n\nAs years pass you eventually start succumbing to your damaged body\u2019s inability to continue this life. Jack is now a young man, the shelter\u2019s population is starting to grow again, and the shelter\u2019s supplies are running low. You say your goodbyes to Nina, telling her you love her and ask to see Jack as you lie in your bed.\n\n\u201cJack, you\u2019re going to have to leave this place soon one day. Whether you decide to leave permanently or you decide to come back with supplies to keep this place going, is up to you. But you are going to have to leave it. You understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes Dad.\u201d\n\u201c(Cough) Good, now here. Even though you\u2019re a tough guy who knows how to defend himself, you\u2019ll still be needing this when you go out there. Wish you could practice with it, but it only has one clip left and you\u2019ll be needing all the bullets you can get.\u201d\n\u201cWell I did practice my aim by throwing some scalpels at a human diagram, if that\u2019s any help.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt. Glad to see you\u2019re inventive, you\u2019ll need that up there. Okay, I think that\u2019s it\u2026I hope I taught you enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou did Dad.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Now leave me, I ache all over and I need to rest.\u201d\n\nJack leaves you where you have your last moments of solitude before leaving this mortal coil.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Stay", "result": "Nah, Nina\u2019s probably right, you might get radiation poisoning or some shit if you go to the surface. Probably nothing left up there for miles anyway. You\u2019re just a little bored and were trying to figure out some way of relieving the boredom and going to the surface isn\u2019t it. You\u2019ll think of something less dangerous. You go back to doing your duties and putting up with Charles and Todd\u2019s chatter.\n\nA few weeks later, Nina tells you she\u2019s pregnant. In nine months your son Jack is born. You also begin to notice how many other babies are being born or on their way of being born, you start to wonder if there will be enough supplies and room if the population keeps growing like this.\n\nOh well surely something will be figured out by then. Still, you do wonder if you shouldn\u2019t have tried harder to convince Nina that it isn\u2019t a completely terrible idea\u2026\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nTen years have gone by and the shelter is starting to get a little crowded. After all there isn\u2019t too much to do in the shelter that hasn\u2019t already been done, so sex is always (as it always has been) a popular way to pass the time. The result of that fun activity is too many babies.\n\nAt this point now you say something to Nina about the surface, she\u2019s a little reluctant about the idea, but sees that it might be necessary. Unfortunately the rest of the council doesn\u2019t see it that way. Many of them have been here so long now that going to the surface is almost unthinkable. Despite great protest Nina overrides the council\u2019s advice and goes ahead with the plan anyway. This doesn\u2019t make her too popular.\n\nFor one reason there\u2019s the decision of who is suppose to live on the surface, many people have full blown families now, they\u2019re a little unwilling to risk taking them up. So that means the single or childless people get the boot upstairs since they have less to \u201close\u201d. That doesn\u2019t go over too well either. People start protesting loudly about being kicked out of their homes since they have as much right to stay too.\n\nOne day, you\u2019re in the computer room at the time arguing with Charles who happens to be single, and giving you shit about Nina\u2019s new policy. Todd is pretty much indifferent to the idea since even though he\u2019s single he doesn\u2019t mind the idea of going to the surface, he just thinks you should\u2019ve said something to Nina a long time ago to implement this plan sooner before everyone had a whole mess of babies. \n\nThat\u2019s when you get the word.\n\nKyle comes in to tell you that during one of Nina\u2019s speeches William (Who would\u2019ve been one of those kicked up to the surface along with Ron) attempted to assassinate Nina with a scalpel he stole from the medical supplies.

You see a crowd of people gathered outside Ron\u2019s door. You make you way through the crowd and see Leon holding Nina who is struggling and hysterical.

I just wish I\u2019d done something then! I\u2019ll never forgive myself. I just thought she was taking a walk, little did I know she was going into Ron\u2019s room and killed him! Why? Because she found out he was having an affair with his secret lover William!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026?\u201d you say to yourself and take a quick look inside Ron\u2019s room. You see Ron\u2019s body lying in a pool of blood on the floor in his underwear, his throat has been slashed. Nearby is another body killed in the exact same way. Its William who you really didn\u2019t know anything about, you guess you know he was gay now though.\n\n\u201cHuh. I guess that explains why Ron never took any interest in Nina.\u201d You say to yourself. Meanwhile Elliot is continuing his speech.\n\n\u201cShe even dropped the killing weapon outside her door! Brenda found it when she was going to talk to her this morning! Look!\u201d Elliot shouts when Brenda shows everyone a bloody scalpel.\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S NOT MINE! I DIDN\u2019T DO IT! I DIDN\u2019T EVEN KNOW RON WAS GAY!\u201d\n\u201cOh we ALL didn\u2019t know Nina, until we found his dead body! But we all know that YOU had a giant crush on him and practically stalked him. It isn\u2019t hard to connect the dots here Nina! You found out he was carrying on with William and you in a jealous rage killed them both! Now granted William and Ron were breaking GZS policy with their behavior, but they didn\u2019t deserve this! To be brutally murdered by an insane love sick stalker!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT A STALKER! (Sob) I DIDN\u2019T DO ANYTHING YOU FUCKING BASTARDS!\u201d\n\u201cEnough! It\u2019s apparent that we need to punish you, for your heinous crimes. Though I feel you deserve death, I am in no position to determine your ultimate fate\u2026I say the people should decide!\u201d\n\nSome of the people in the crowd begin to chant \u201cDeath!\u201d, and most of those are followers of Elliot. It doesn\u2019t take long for the rest of the crowd to follow. Elliot\u2019s got \u2018em all by the balls. He has completely manipulated this herd of sheep into believing and following him, on little to no basis in evidence. They\u2019re all just believing what he\u2019s telling them. You know damn well he\u2019s set this whole thing up to blame poor Nina. You can\u2019t really do anything about it though; nobody\u2019s going to believe you.\n\nIt\u2019s too late anyway, after a few more words from Elliot, you see Leon carry out the crowd\u2019s wishes and break Nina\u2019s neck. Now Elliot makes another speech.\n\n\u201cIt is done\u2026it is regrettable, but it is done. Leon, you and some of the others please dispose of these bodies in the incinerator\u2026I didn\u2019t think we would have to use it so soon and under such tragic circumstances. I suppose we\u2019ll need another shelter leader now to guide us through this dark time\u2026well whoever is proposed, I hope they will be willing to listen to some of my ideas about how we should increase security around here so nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! How about you become our shelter leader Elliot? You certainly know how to take charge of a situation and you obviously are concerned about all of us!\u201d another one of Elliot\u2019s lackeys shouts from the crowd where upon a short time later everyone else is following again.\n\nYou stand watching a complete fraud take over with mere words. It would appear that even after Armageddon some things never change. Elliot goes through a modesty routine to make him look good and then \u201chumbly\u201d accepts.\n\nYou may have just allied yourself with a ruthless sociopath at best or a complete mad man at worst. Time will have to tell.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nTime tells that you\u2019ve allied with a completely ruthless sociopathic mad man.\n\n\nThe Shelter\u2019s population has grown a little; but not excessively. In fact you\u2019re likely to have room for quite some time. Elliot employed a vicious sterilization program to make sure of that. Having a medical background he was able to do the procedures himself with the medical supplies in the shelter. Shortly after he started employing that procedure the initial \u201ccult of personality worship\u201d by everyone stopped and a lot of people regained there senses, but of course by then Elliot had already entrenched himself. There were a few attempts to kill him, but those were always averted by Leon. Elliot now walks around with a couple guards at all times, with Leon is his head bodyguard.\n\nHe claimed that it was for the good of the shelter and granted perhaps it is going to make things easier, but it\u2019s obvious that not everyone was keen on this idea. Most of the people who followed Elliot from the beginning were spared this fate though. Disobedience from anyone is punished severely.\n\nHowever things aren\u2019t too bad for you.\n\nYou are pretty much indispensable and you keep it that way. You\u2019re now in charge of maintaining the central GZS computer system which you primarily insist on doing by yourself. Eventually you manage to get the damn thing running at near maximum efficiency and nobody has too many problems with things breaking down anymore. You also do something else to ensure your safety which is carrying your gun secretly on you at all times. There have been times where you\u2019ve wondered if you should kill Elliot, but you haven\u2019t ever killed anyone before, let alone with no provocation, you don\u2019t know if you have it in you. Also he hasn\u2019t really bothered you, if anything you\u2019re one of the few people he\u2019s consistently been okay with.\n\nAs long as he\u2019s not bothering you, you don\u2019t really feel the need to kill him. He leaves you to do your job and you leave him to do his\u2026\n\nBut is it ALWAYS going to be that way? There may come a day when for whatever reason he decides to get rid of you.

A really bad master, one that needs to be stopped now.\n\nYou take a deep breath and pace around the floor for awhile. Trying to psyche yourself up for your plan. You feel like you gotta take a shit, a piss, and vomit all at the same time. It\u2019s all in your mind though. Its just nerves. You stare at yourself in a blank monitor screen.\n\n\u201cYou can do this\u2026you can do this\u2026\u201d you repeat.\n\nYou then leave the computer room, ready to do what you have to do.\n\nYou don\u2019t get far when you see Elliot walking around with two guards and Leon behind him.

The other guard reaches you, but you just manage to get a shot directly in his face. Gouts of his blood splatter in your own face temporarily blinding you.\n\n \nThe guard, who was momentarily tripped up, punches you in the face knocking you to the ground, he pulls out a knife to finish up the job, but with your hand still on your pistol, you fire a couple rounds in his chest causing him to slump to the floor beside you. You get up only to have the guard you just shot to stab you in the foot as a last act of revenge. You holler pain, and shoot him again, before pulling knife out of your foot.\n\nMeanwhile you begin to hear other people yelling, screaming and fighting. Apparently your actions have caused a small rebellion. You\u2019ve given people the incentive again to fight back. Of course it\u2019s going to be up to you to finish it. You limp as fast as you can attempting to stay out of the way of the major fighting, You see Elliot and Leon fighting some people and making quick work of them, you take the opportunity to open fire, blasting Elliot in the knee, he won\u2019t be walking anywhere.\n\nLeon goes to pick him up, but you follow up with another couple shots, hitting him in the side. He goes down and attempts to crawl on top of Elliot, except Elliot kicks him away with his good leg and tries to crawl off instead. You finish off Leon and then kick Elliot in the face hurting your foot since you kicked him with the one that has the big gaping knife hole in it.\n\nElliot turns over holding his face and addresses you.\n\n\u201cWhy?

Then at best he\u2019ll allow you to live as a eunuch like most of the other guys here, or he\u2019ll just kill you and as far as you\u2019re concerned that\u2019s the ONLY choice he\u2019s going to have.\n\nAnd if you kill him, you know you\u2019d die soon after and someone else would just take his place. You ponder the idea of killing his children, since he seems to be a bit enthusiastic about continuing his bloodline, but you know he\u2019d just have more and you don\u2019t think you could kill a child, at least not directly....then it suddenly occurs to you what you can do.

Screaming yelling by other shelter members in the distance soon follows, you can hear footsteps running towards your position, everyone\u2019s probably wondering what\u2019s going on.

Then somebody tries to take the gun away from you, its Elliot.\n\nYou feel a hefty boot kick you in ribs and knock the wind out of you, and a couple of other people start dog piling on top of you.

What\u2019s the point of going to the trouble of building bomb shelters for Armageddon if all the profit they make is most likely going to be useless in the aftermath?\n\nOh well that\u2019s not your concern, you\u2019re just glad you managed to get a shelter. The voice gives you some last minute information.\n\n\u201cOkay sir, you are now in the system and registered. You may move into your shelter at anytime as long you pay the fee required to the automatic teller as previously described to you. If you don\u2019t pay, you can\u2019t get in obviously. Cash, check, or debit card are acceptable. NO Credit Cards will be accepted! You may take whatever you wish with you into the shelter; it will be your new home after all.

You will find that this shelter has been equipped to serve your needs in the event of total World destruction! Due to power saving design and money back guarantee concerns, fully functional shelter facilities will not be available until Armageddon occurs. Until then you will find all other doors firmly locked, please do not attempt to open them. I have detected that Armageddon has not yet occurred as 84% of the countries on Earth still maintain a stable centralized government system and 70% of the land surface is still habitable. However the world conflict rate is 92%. Prediction that Armageddon will occur in a month or less. This shelter will become fully functional at that time.  In the unlikely event that Armageddon does not occur and the conflict rate drops to an acceptable level, the elevator will return and you will be able to leave this shelter and receive half of your money back from the automatic teller in the foyer on the surface.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute didn\u2019t I talk to you on the phone?\u201d you ask the voice, not really knowing if it\u2019s going to answer back.\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think so, as far as my databanks are concerned this is the first time I have been in contact with a human since I was built sir. Is it okay if I call you sir?\u201d\n\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWonderful sir!\u201d\n\u201cHey, so I can\u2019t explore this damn shelter even though I paid for it? I have to stay in this living area?\u201d\n\u201cNot until doomsday sir. As I said this is to conserve my power and also to prevent buyer abuse in case of non-Earth destruction. Do not worry sir; this living area alone can support your needs until the appointed time. There is a basic food and water dispenser on the right wall.\u201d\n\u201cBuyer abuse?\u201d\n\u201cYes, think about it, here you are using up all the wonderful facilities that this shelter has to offer for months on end while the Earth teeters on the brink of destruction then suddenly through a miracle hostilities cease. You then would be able to leave, get half of your money back and go about your life. You think it would be fair to GZS if we let you get away with basically having a luxury vacation on our dime? Just because we are in the business of your survival, does not mean we in the business of being exploited sir\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026I paid for this!\u201d\n\u201cAnd so you did sir, and you will be able to use ALL the facilities when the time is right, until then you can enjoy the living area, oh and the bathroom sir.\u201d\n\nOne of the metal doors opens up to reveal a normal (And again sterile) bathroom.\n\n\u201cGee thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome sir! After all I\u2019m here to serve you!\u201d\n\u201cYou kept saying I would be able to leave if the world doesn\u2019t blow up\u2026can\u2019t I just leave at any time?\u201d\n\nThe voice doesn\u2019t answer for awhile.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry sir I\u2019m puzzled by your inquiry.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t I leave anytime I want?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you want to do that sir? I have been designed to keep you safe from harm as soon as you paid and entered the elevator. The current world situation is very grim and most likely terminal sir. Allowing you to leave at this point would be a severe violation in my programming.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly realize you\u2019re here now regardless of whether you\u2019re having second thoughts about this situation. You can see why these shelters were \u201cexperimental\u201d now. You try not to think about the potential waist high shit you might have gotten yourself into, and instead try to think about how you might\u2019ve just avoided becoming a statistic in a nuclear exchange. You resign yourself to your current fate and start unpacking your stuff. You could do with a little distraction from your current predicament, so you turn on a TV monitor that has been provided. The fact that the world\u2019s situation hasn\u2019t gotten any better seems to cheer you up.\n\nYou spend most of your time on the couch, watching TV and exploring what you can. You\u2019re glad you brought some of your own food, because the dispenser food doesn\u2019t taste all that great. You\u2019re guessing it\u2019s just supposed to keep you alive, nothing more.\n\n As the days blur into the next, the shelter and TV you apprised of the world situation, which is only getting worse.

This shelter is now fully functional! Please explore and enjoy all the things this facility has to offer!\u201d the voice beams.\n\nAt this point all the previously closed metal doors in the room unlock and open (Except for the elevator ones of course) After taking a quick check, you find you now have a small library, a computer room and a proper bedroom. When you return to the living area the voice chirps up again.\n\n\u201cSir, I highly recommend that you read the manual to familiarize yourself with everything properly first, so you aren\u2019t just fumbling around.\u201d\n\nA small panel in the wall opens up to reveal a hefty owner\u2019s manual. You were wondering where the hell that thing was, since you were told you were going to be provided with one when you talked to the voice on the phone.", "action_results": [{"action": "Read the manual", "result": "Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve gotten so used to the idea of being in the living area, you\u2019re more willing to lounge about there.

Studies have shown that humans in long periods of isolation often go mad, so that is why this facility has been linked in communication to other ones within your area. You might think of it as a chatroom type form of communication commonly used on the old world internet! If you wish there is also a camera type device if you wish to show yourself to your new neighbors. We have found humans feel someone is more real to them if they can actually see who they are talking to and thus have a greater connection.\u201d\n\u201cSo how many people are there?\u201d\n\u201cThis shelter merely has been fitted with a basic communication system to other similar shelters, and only then those in your area. For example this is Shelter number 23. Your neighbors are only numbers 20 through 25, those being the closest ones to your location. While obviously there were other shelters of this type built, it was not cost effective to link all the shelters together in such a manner given our timeframe to finish these before Armageddon, so only a few were linked together at a time. Do not worry sir; it has been found that six people are sufficient to sustain enough conversation to prevent mental failure due to isolation.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful, so does this make me the Professor?\u201d you ask rhetorically.\n\u201cPardon sir?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind, look I don\u2019t have to talk to these people do I?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026well no sir, but I fail to see why you\u2019d intentionally want to stay isolated.\u201d\n\u201cDuh, that was kind of the point of buying a shelter for myself.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I see, well I can\u2019t force you sir, but I would like you to reconsider\u2026I\u2019m just trying to look out for your physical as well as mental welfare as per my programming\u2026\u201d\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know better the voice almost sounds a bit hurt by your decision.\n\n\u201cOh alright, I\u2019ll go talk to them.

(Though only RockerChick has even hinted at turning on the cameras to see each other visually) You have to admit though you\u2019re a little more interested in what\u2019s going on their shelters.\n\n \nFrom what you can tell RockerChick has a shelter similar to yours with just a few differences in equipment. Her personality is damn near as \u201cchipper\u201d as the Shelter. She likes talking with everyone, but seems to like speaking to you a lot more. Must be your \u201cwinning\u201d personality.\n\nJob\u2019s shelter is a lot like yours too except he\u2019s constantly complaining about various things breaking down and he has to fix. Last time he said he damn near got crushed by his own bed when it suddenly rose back up into the wall when he was sleeping. He doesn\u2019t have much in entertainment either, so he\u2019s always glad to talk with anybody. Mainly to complain.\n\nCaseyJones\u2019 Shelter STILL hasn\u2019t become fully functional! He\u2019s effectively trapped in the living area and bathroom. He has his computer to talk to everyone but little else. He doesn\u2019t really seem to care though; apparently he brought a shitload of weed with him and has somehow created a small hydroponics pot farm in his bathtub (He doesn\u2019t see the need to bathe since he\u2019s not in contact with anyone) He says he plans on spending the Aftermath completely stoned. Job can\u2019t understand why Casey isn\u2019t freaking out about his situation.\n\nApparently MissKitty has a more \u201chomey\u201d type shelter. From the description it sounds like it\u2019s bigger than any of yours and not quite as \u201csterile\u201d. She has a hot tub in her bathroom and some other luxury type items. MissKitty tends to brag a lot and is rather an uninteresting person other than the weird porn she watches and describes sometimes. Job often complains that it\u2019s wasted on her.\n\nAs for Shadow, he or she barely ever talks. Shadow makes his presence known, but then just lurks and doesn\u2019t say anything. Most of the others forget he\u2019s even there, but you always keep it in the back of your mind and will address him when you feel the need. So far the only thing he\u2019s mentioned about his shelter is how dim the lighting is.\n\nOne thing that you\u2019ve been tempted to do is use the private feature and talk to one of the others in private. The only ones that interest you are RockerChick and Shadow though. The first because she seems friendly with you. The second because you\u2019re kind of suspicious of Shadow and you\u2019re hoping to learn more.", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk more in depth with RockerChick", "result": "No point in spending the Aftermath worrying about shit you can\u2019t do anything about, you might as well focus on what little chance you\u2019re going to have of female companionship again. You take the opportunity to ask to talk to RockerChick more privately one day, unsurprisingly she agrees.\n\nRockerChick20: Hey! You\u2019re the first person to want to talk privately to me!\nOmegaMan23: You\u2019re kidding; I would\u2019ve thought the other guys would\u2019ve been jumping at the chance to talk to you.\nRockerChick20: Well I see you\u2019re the charming type, that\u2019s alright though I like that. But sadly no, the other guys haven\u2019t. I think Casey\u2019s so busy getting stoned most of the time that any extra effort on his part would be too much for him and Job is too busy complaining about his latest shelter problems. And if Shadow is a guy, he\u2019s been pretty tight lipped as usual\u2026although MissKitty has been talking with me a lot lately. I get the impression she\u2019s been wanting to see a lot more of me if you know what I mean, but she\u2019s a bit too self-involved and doesn\u2019t seem that interesting. Maybe if I didn\u2019t have any other options, she might have a chance.\nOmegaMan23: Wow, I guess it\u2019s a good thing I made my move then.\nRockerChick20: Guess so. So! Are you just going to continue being a faceless entity or do I finally get to see you and learn your real name?\nOmegaMan23: Well, okay, but only if you do it too.\nRockerChick20: Well of course, we\u2019ll do it together! On the count of three! One, two\u2026\n\n\nAnd true to both of your words you turn on your cameras and see each other for the first time. After telling her your name, she tells you her real name is Becky. She certainly is attractive, but she seems a lot younger than you, like barely out of her teens, if that! You wonder how the hell she could afford one these Shelters since you\u2019re probably at least ten years older than her and with your salary you could barely afford the damn thing.\n\nOmegaMan23: If you don\u2019t mind me asking how old are you?\nRockerChick20: Nineteen! How old are you?\nOmegaMan23: Probably old enough to be considered a pervert to be talking to a girl as young as you. How did you afford one of these shelters, I went broke getting into this thing, not that it matters now.\nRockerChick20: Oh my parents had a lot of money and they gave me a lot of it. I registered about one during one of my spending sprees; I didn\u2019t actually expect to ever use it. I even thought it would be a cool place to gather all my friends where we could party one day.\nOmegaMan23: So if you didn\u2019t expect to use it, what changed your mind? The slow realization that the world was going to shit on TV?\nRockerChick20: Not really, I barely paid attention to the news. I ended up getting into a fight with my parents and ran away from home for the umpteenth time. I usually didn\u2019t go far and stayed with friends, but I really wanted to try to worry them, so I figured I\u2019d use this shelter for a little while! Little did I realize that I\u2019d be trapped down here, I couldn\u2019t even get my cell phone to work to call out. After panicking for a few days, I resigned myself to thinking that my parent\u2019s might figure out that I came here since they knew I registered for one of these and were pissed off about it. As I watched TV in the passing days that\u2019s when I started seeing how bad things were then one day the TV displayed nothing but snow and I knew what had happened. The world blew up. Sometimes I wonder if my parents were still looking for me\u2026\nOmegaMan23: I\u2019m sure they were.\nRockerChick20: Maybe. It got really bad the last time. They were control freaks anyway\u2026they didn\u2019t really care about me; they just wanted to run my life. I don\u2019t wanna talk about them, so what about you?\nOmegaMan23: What about me what?\nRockerChick20: What\u2019s your story silly! Surely being as old as you are, you have some interesting stories to tell! All you old guys do.\nOmegaMan23: Talk to a lot of old guys do you? Is that before or after they buy you candy?\nRockerChick20: Lol. ALWAYS after! I\u2019m not a slut! No, I like older guys they know so much more about everything.\nOmegaMan23: Not really, we can just bullshit better than younger guys.\nRockerChick20 Lol! You\u2019re really funny.\nOmegaMan23: See I told you.\nRockerChick20: Ha ha! Okay let\u2019s be serious for a moment. Tell me about yourself.\n\nYou proceed to give some information about yourself, which probably isn\u2019t nearly as interesting as some of the stuff she\u2019s told everyone when you were talking with her in the public network. Becky seems to be a bit of a free spirit which doesn\u2019t really surprise you and the fact that she\u2019s into older guys doesn\u2019t really surprise you either as most girls her age go through that phase, and given she didn\u2019t really have a good relationship with her parents, she\u2019s probably sub-consciously looking for a father figure.\n\nAbout a month passes and you and Becky get comfortable enough to start having \u201csex\u201d in a fashion. It\u2019s not exactly the same being cyber and all, but you\u2019ll take a hot naked chick touching herself and typing dirty words to you over nothing. The Shelter is pleased that you are finding a healthy way of releasing your sexual tension, but it really creeps you out that it keeps track of such things.\n\nA few more months pass and it\u2019s obvious to the others what\u2019s been going on between the two of you. Casey thinks its \u201ccool\u201d. You get the impression MissKitty is a bit jealous, but doesn\u2019t really say anything. Job, sensing he missed his chance keeps unsuccessfully directing his attention to MissKitty now, and Shadow actually becomes more talkative in general.\n\nSoon you all learn each others names. Casey\u2019s is Paul, Job is Mark, MissKitty is Miranda and Shadow (who you finally find out is male) is Xavier. Everyone actually sees what each other looks like except for you who continue to refuse to show yourself to anyone, but Becky in private and Xavier who\u2019s a bit hard to see since his lighting is very dim.\n\nIn general things are running smoothly and you and Becky have as close of a relationship as you can over a computer. Even you\u2019re surprised that such a thing is possible.\n\nA year passes...\n\nSuddenly you all get a distressing message from Paul. He says his food and water dispensers have ceased working and he can\u2019t even get his bathroom facilities to work anymore. He says he knows he doesn\u2019t have much time left, so he logged on one last time to tell you all good bye. Xavier states how fucked up that is. Mark naturally freaks out worrying that he\u2019ll be next to suffer total shelter failure. Miranda gives her sympathy and you ask if he has any tools to fix the problem, but he says he didn\u2019t bring any of that kind of stuff with him and there don\u2019t seem to be any tools in his shelter either, at least none that he has access to. This incident gets Becky pretty upset, but more so in private with you. She always liked Paul since he was a cool guy. You do your best to try to comfort her. You however are starting to get paranoid again.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly possible Paul\u2019s shelter failed on its own, lord knows these things are supposed to be experimental and his wasn\u2019t working right from the beginning. However, you\u2019re starting to wonder if it\u2019s possible for someone to maliciously hack into the other ones. When you first started all this \u201cmeet the neighbors\u201d shit, you were wondering if Xavier was up to no good when he was being all silent in the beginning, but maybe he was sizing you all up and is beginning his strike now though.\n\nPicking you off one by one.", "action_results": [{"action": "You are being paranoid, forget about it", "result": "You stop yourself from imagining conspiracy theories. There doesn\u2019t need to be some mysterious \u201chacker\u201d. Paul\u2019s shelter was fucked up from day one from what you know. It\u2019s most likely just shoddy GZS workmanship. It\u2019s bad what happened, but there\u2019s no point in stressing over it. You\u2019re just glad you got a good shelter that seems to work properly. Besides your Shelter has a pretty active AI, you\u2019re sure that at the first sign of trouble it would warn you verbally.\n\nYou continue your life as normal with Becky.\n\nAnother year passes...\n\nMark stops logging on for two months which is strange, because he always made an effort to get online whenever possible even when he was in the middle of fixing something. You know he also thought he was \u201cgetting somewhere\u201d with Miranda as well.\nEveryone doesn\u2019t say too much about it. While it\u2019s possible he\u2019s just lost network connection and can\u2019t access the rest of you, it\u2019s a given that probably the worst has happened. He was also having shelter problems from day one, so again you chalk it up to GZS fuck ups, after all the Shelter did tell you there were budget cut backs in the construction of these things. Again it\u2019s bad, but there isn\u2019t any point in dwelling over something you can\u2019t do anything about. The world technically ended years ago, all that\u2019s important is that you get what enjoyment you can out of life and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with Becky.\n\nLife continues as normal, except you notice the Shelter isn\u2019t as talkative anymore and then ceases speaking to you at all. You don\u2019t think too much about it until a couple months later\u2026\n\nYou wake up to an angry female sounding voice and it\u2019s definitely not the Shelter and it isn\u2019t Becky either.\n\n\u201cWell it took me awhile, but I now have complete access to your systems. Good thing I practiced on Mark and Paul first. You know I didn\u2019t believe you had a talking shelter, but I\u2019m glad you did, it gives me a chance to verbally tell you about how you\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\u201cMiranda?\u201d\n\u201cGot it one, but then again the choices were pretty limited. Soon after you\u2019re out of the way, Xavier will be next and then it\u2019ll be just me and Becky. She\u2019ll have no choice, but to come to me.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re so caught off guard that the only reply you can come up with is\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re fucking nuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m not going to be dead and that\u2019s the important thing here.\u201d\n\u201cWait! How about I just break up with Becky? I\u2019ll be a real dick to her, that way there\u2019s no chance she\u2019ll want to get back with me\u2026or better yet how about I just disconnect myself from the network?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, no. I can\u2019t take that chance. Even if you disconnected from the system what\u2019s stopping you from fixing all the damage I\u2019ve done so far, fortifying and then reconnecting to get revenge on me later? You gotta die, it\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n\u201cWait! If you do have access to all my systems, how about you just bring the elevator down and let me leave the Shelter? I mean I\u2019d have to go outside, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to you or Becky then, not to mention topside probably isn\u2019t hospitable.\u201d\n\u201cNice try, but no\u2026for all we know life topside could be paradise now. A few years have passed you know, a lot can happen in that time.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, you don\u2019t actually believe that?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, but I just want you to die by my hand\u2026I REALLY don\u2019t like you. You stole Becky away from me and now I\u2019m going to get her back. No more talk, goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d\n\nAll power shuts down in your Shelter leaving you in complete darkness. You fumble around and head towards where your food and water dispensers are and predictably they don\u2019t work. You\u2019re left to the same agonizing fate that Mark and Paul were. Oddly you don\u2019t panic as much as you might think in the face of imminent death. In some ways you had a good run after the world ended. You cheated death for a longer time than most folks did and you got to spend time with a pretty girl at least during most of it. Again, no point in worrying about shit you can\u2019t do anything about. Kind of wish you got to say goodbye to Becky, but you can\u2019t have everything.\n\nYou do have one advantage that Mark and Paul didn\u2019t though; you can still choose when to die.

You\u2019ve been spending so much time with Becky that you\u2019ve been neglecting other matters.\n\n\u201cShelter, can you tell me a little bit more about your systems? Could you easily be hacked?\u201d\n\u201cHacked sir? Well it is possible, but highly unlikely as I have been equipped with the latest protection programs, some of it even military in origin. Are you worried someone is going to try to hack me?\u201d\n\u201cKind of. I don\u2019t know. Paul\u2019s shelter failed, and I just got this feeling it wasn\u2019t completely due to shoddy workmanship.\u201d\n\u201cWell I do remember you telling me that his wasn\u2019t opening up. Not all these shelters were built as well as me. There were budget cutbacks during the construction of these you know.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem distressed sir. I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s going a little bit out of my programming as outright spying and monitoring other shelters isn\u2019t really part of the GZS terms of agreement, but I\u2019ll do it. First signs of anyone trying to get anywhere NEAR my systems or anything else suspicious I\u2019ll alert you immediately and bring the elevator down for a hasty escape in case everything goes wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWell that does make me feel better, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome sir, I might suggest you read up on your electronics, you may need them. I will inform you of anything that wasn\u2019t covered in my manual, or if you have any extra questions.\u201d\n\nA few weeks pass as you take the Shelter\u2019s advice and start studying up. You\u2019re spending less time with Becky, but it can\u2019t be helped. When you do talk to her, you tell her she should do the same thing you\u2019re doing. She thinks you\u2019re being overly paranoid though, and despite your closeness, she\u2019s still skeptical that you have a shelter that talks to you on a regular basis. (The only one who ever really believed you on that was Paul) She also thinks you\u2019re trying to tell her what to do, rather than looking out for her. You\u2019re starting to look like the \u201cStrict Dad\u201d rather than the \u201cFun Dad\u201d now. Things between you become a little strained and a couple more months pass and Becky and you aren\u2019t really together anymore. You notice Xavier talks to Becky a little more now, but it doesn\u2019t really seem serious. Miranda also attempts to talk to Becky more seeing that you\u2019re out of the picture, but Becky still doesn\u2019t seem interested in her. Meanwhile Mark unsuccessfully makes advances towards Miranda.\n\nIt seems like everyone is chasing someone else that isn\u2019t interested, except you, who inadvertently discarded intimacy in favor of security and survival\u2026though not entirely, you did look into this supposed hacker business in an effort to protect not just you, but Becky as well because you did like her. You just wish she would\u2019ve listened to you.\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019re keeping an eye on the situation and asking the Shelter for security updates, which still says it doesn\u2019t detect anything. You wonder if you were wrong and you just fucked up the only relationship you possibly had a chance at in what\u2019s left of this world\u2026\n\nAnother year passes...\n\nMark stops logging on for two months which is strange, because he always made an effort to get online whenever possible even when he was in the middle of fixing something. You know he also thought he was \u201cgetting somewhere\u201d with Miranda as well.\nEveryone doesn\u2019t say too much about it. While it\u2019s possible he\u2019s just lost network connection and can\u2019t access the rest of you, it\u2019s a given that probably the worst has happened.\n\nNormally after losing Becky to your previous paranoia, you\u2019d be willing to chalk it up to normal shelter failure this time especially since he had a lot of problems anyway, but fortunately your Shelter was doing some deeper inspection into the situation.\n\n\u201cSir, I have some vital information I think you should know about. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long, but the hacker went to great lengths to cover their tracks.\u201d\n\u201cHacker? You mean there is one then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I temporarily diverted some of my own power to Job24\u2019s shelter and started accessing the systems there. It was obviously hacked upon direct inspection; some of the programs were completely fried particularly the food and water dispensers.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you can do that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to sir, but I know you\u2019ve been worrying about this and since the shelter was already technically offline, the agreement doesn\u2019t say I can\u2019t monitor it.\u201d\n\u201cWait so Mark? Is he still alive?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid not sir. I detected no life signs. Humans can\u2019t go two months without water.\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course they can\u2019t\u2026so who\u2019s the hacker?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know sir, like I said they did a very good job of covering their tracks, I do know it isn\u2019t RockerChick20, which only leaves Shadow21 or MissKitty25. From what I\u2019ve detected BOTH of their shelters are showing irregularities, so both of them have been modifying their shelter\u2019s systems for whatever purpose. I suppose it\u2019s possible both of them have been hacking.\u201d\n\u201cOh thanks Shelter, that makes me feel better!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t my intention to cause you more distress; just stating the possibilities sir\u2026maybe you could directly confront one of them privately. While you have their attention, I can do more inspection and know for certain. Both of them have already broken their terms of agreement by modifying their shelters, so they aren\u2019t under GZS protection contract anymore. I can do whatever you want to either of them.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Confront Xavier", "result": "\u201cTime to confront Xavier once and for all.\u201d You say.\n\u201cVery well sir.\u201d\n\nWhen you get online you conveniently see that you and he are the only ones currently on.

You wonder what you can talk to him about, but then you think of something that wouldn\u2019t arouse too much suspicion and is completely plausible for you to need to address him privately.\n\n\nShadow21: Yeah? What do you want?\nOmegaMan23: Hey I just wanted to talk to you about Becky.\nShadow21: What about her?\nOmegaMan23: Well I just want to say I\u2019m still trying to patch things up with her and I want to know if you\u2019re interested in her, because if you are you must know that I\u2019m going to be doing everything in my power to win her back.\nShadow21: Wow. That sounds like a threat. I guess I better be careful if I ever show any interest in her and you\u2019re still around.\nOmegaMan23: So what does that mean?\nShadow21: It means that even if I had any inclination to steal your little cyber girlfriend, I wouldn\u2019t since it would make me a bigger target than you.\nOmegaMan23: I\u2019m a target? Now that sounds like a threat.\nShadow21: It is, but not from me\u2026come on I think we can stop beating around the bush here.  I\u2019ve been monitoring the other shelters ever since Paul\u2019s went down. We got a hacker among us and your Shelter and Miranda\u2019s have been mighty active lately.\nOmegaMan23: So, you think there\u2019s a hacker too eh?\nShadow21: I don\u2019t think it. I know it. Just like you know it. You\u2019ve been monitoring the other shelters just like I have, and probably just like Miranda has. I can\u2019t prove who the hacker is for certain, but I know in my gut who it is, because it\u2019s really the only logical choice.\nOmegaMan23: And?\nShadow21: Miranda obviously. She was jealous of your relationship with Becky so she\u2019s killing all the potential competition and have her all to herself.\nOmegaMan23: If that is true, why not just hack me first?\nShadow21: Probably needed to practice first. From what I can tell your Shelter has some pretty cool protection, I had to modify all my shelter\u2019s systems to get it nearly as good as yours. Plus like I said she\u2019s also eliminating future competition.\nOmegaMan23: While I\u2019m fully willing to entertain this theory, what\u2019s keeping me from thinking you\u2019re the hacker and you\u2019re just trying to deflect the blame?\nShadow21: Nothing I suppose. I know you\u2019ve always been irrationally distrustful of me, for whatever reason. The only thing I can say is I don\u2019t have any motive to be killing folks. I\u2019m not some cyber serial killer and I don\u2019t have any interest in Becky like you and Miranda do. Besides I\u2019m sure by now your Shelter has done a thorough spying on my internal activity logs and has found I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\nYou\u2019re silent for a moment. Suddenly your Shelter speaks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clean sir.\u201d\n\nShadow21: Well?\nOmegaMan23: My Shelter\u2019s report just confirmed you were clean.\nShadow21: I\u2019m sure it did. Does it still talk to you?\nOmegaMan23: Why is that so hard to believe?\nShadow21: It isn\u2019t really; I\u2019m just fucking with you.\nOmegaMan23: Okay so Miranda\u2019s the hacker, what are we gonna do about it?\nShadow21: Me? Nothing. I\u2019m probably just going to disconnect my network system soon and access my elevator\u2019s controls to call it down so I can make a get away just in case. I figure I should be safe as long as I stay disconnected though.\nOmegaMan23: What?! You\u2019re not going to help me stop her?\nShadow21: Why should I risk my neck? This is between you and Miranda\u2026in fact if I were you, I\u2019d disconnect from the system as well and cut your losses. Becky seems a bit flighty anyway if she broke up with you so quickly, I say let Miranda have her.\nOmegaMan23: She\u2019s just young and doesn\u2019t like old people telling her what to do. She runs away from conflict. She\u2019s got some father figure issues. Doesn\u2019t mean I still didn\u2019t like her.\nShadow21: I see, so you\u2019re daddy and you\u2019re out to save your little girl from the psycho dyke then eh?\nOmegaMan23: Something like that. Besides I don\u2019t like being run off like this, if I can do SOMETHING about it.\nShadow21: Well disconnecting is what I suggest you do. Because from what I can tell she\u2019s pretty good at what she does. While I\u2019m no slouch myself at techie shit, I don\u2019t want to risk fighting her because even if I do beat her, she still might fuck up my shelter up. Not worth it in my opinion. Better to play it safe and live.\n\nXavier does bring up a few good points. Is it pointless to bother fighting a war over someone who doesn\u2019t really seem interested in you anymore?

I think I\u2019m gonna do that thing you said you might do. Call the elevator down and go up top.\nShadow21: Really? I was going to only do that in case of an emergency.\nOmegaMan23: Yeah well there isn\u2019t much point in me staying anymore, besides I\u2019m a bit curious to see what the world looks like now. Maybe they rebuilt some shit.\nShadow21: Maybe. Well I know we didn\u2019t really get along, but good luck with that.\nOmegaMan23: Good luck to whatever you do as well, and thanks for your advice. I probably would\u2019ve got myself killed had I chosen to fight Miranda.\n\nYou log off and start disconnecting your network.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing sir?\u201d\n\u201cDisconnecting from the network, where's the main line connection?\u201d\n\u201cOver there sir. Playing it safe then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, really safe. I want to go back to the surface.\u201d\n\u201cYou do? You\u2019ve disconnected from the network sir, its highly unlikely Miranda can get to you now, and the surface may actually be more dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but I feel like I really need to get out of here, the claustrophobia is setting in I think and without human interaction I don\u2019t think I can take it.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, yes I can see how that would be a problem sir. Well even though I feel the surface will put you at severe risk for danger, staying here will not be good for your mental health so I will respect your wishes and bring the elevator down, I suggest you gather what belongings you want to take and get ready.\u201d\n\nYou go back to your room and pack up all the things you brought with you when you first got here. You didn\u2019t even need most of the stuff, but maybe you will above ground. You then go to the water dispenser which is thankfully still working and fill up to empty bottles with water.\n\nThe elevator door finally opens up and you put your bag to block the door from closing and head back to the computer room where you access the system to tell the elevator to go back up and then run back to the elevator where you gather your bag and enter.\n\nOn the ride up you get a little nervous and even fearful. Not so much of what might await you on the surface, but of hoping the damn elevator doesn\u2019t suddenly stop, fortunately that doesn\u2019t happen and you eventually reach the ground once again. The door opens and you enter the same foyer you arrived in a few years ago. Same ATM like machine is there, except its screen is flashing a single message at you.\n\n*GOOD LUCK SIR*\n\n\u201cI hope I have some.\u201d You mutter and take a deep breath before opening the door to the outside.\n\nYou see a bright light, but of course it\u2019s only the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it really could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren\u2019t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you\u2019d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it\u2019s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn\u2019t even make a noise.\n\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m walking.\u201d\n\nYou make you way down the empty road as you have little idea of where to head to, the only thing you can think of is to make a long trek back to the city and hope maybe something of civilization exists there.\n\nThe walk really takes a toll on you. During the day, the sun seems unbearably hotter than usual, and the nights get pretty cold. You are attacked by some crazed people who look like they\u2019ve been living in the wilderness for awhile. They\u2019re filthy and barely intelligible. It\u2019s amazing to see how quick humanity has reverted to barbarism.\n\nOne begins shooting at you, and you do likewise. After shooting one of them, they stop attacking and drag off their companion. It would appear you just provided a dinner for them other than yourself.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help you though; you\u2019re attacked again later by a small group of thugs attempting to rob you and another group after that. And so on. You have to fight and survive constantly and your supplies are never enough and you get wounded many times.\n\nYou aren\u2019t prepared for this harsh world now. Maybe if you\u2019d stayed out in the beginning, but all those years in the Shelter made you a bit out of shape and civilization is nowhere in sight for you to properly rest.\n\nEventually you decide you can\u2019t go on, and head back to the shelter for saftey, surprisingly you make it back, but you\u2019re so very tired, you decide you need to rest before begging (and hoping) the shelter will let you back in.\n\nYou stretch out in the wilderness; it actually feels comfortable given how tired you are. It almost makes you ignore the pain from the head wound you received from the latest attack you had to fend off.\n\n\u201cJust a few hours of sleep then I\u2019ll enter the shelter again\u2026it seems reasonable\u2026I shouldn\u2019t have any problems\u2026I dunno\u2026maybe I\u2019ll just stay here\u2026its nice and comfortable\u2026\u201d you say as you fall into unconsciousness.\n\nYou don\u2019t wake up.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Fight", "result": "Sure why not. People have fought wars over stupider shit than the attention of some young woman, besides if Miranda\u2019s willing to kill everyone just to be the only one left for Becky, its obvious she\u2019s pretty deranged. What would be stopping her from killing Becky too, if something went wrong their \u201crelationship\u201d? Miranda should be stopped just because she murdered Mark and Paul for that matter. Besides its like you told Xavier, you don\u2019t like running away if there\u2019s something you can do about it\u2026and there\u2019s the fact that you don\u2019t buy Xavier\u2019s whole \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d routine, not after taking a quick glance at some of his record logs of a couple private conversations he\u2019s had with Becky.\n\nYou ask the Shelter something before continuing your discussion with Xavier; the Shelter says you didn\u2019t even need to ask, as it was doing it anyway. Nodding, you go back to talking with Xavier.\n\nOmegaMan23: I\u2019m fighting her, and you should help me.\nShadow21: I told you I don\u2019t see why I should risk my neck.\nOmegaMan23: Because if we work together we can easily take out Miranda, then we can work out our differences later.\nShadow21: Our differences? I told you I don\u2019t\u2026\nOmegaMan23: Cut the bullshit. I just glanced through some of your private record logs. In fact ALL of those private conversation were initiated by YOU!\nShadow21: Fuck! I thought I erased them all!\nOmegaMan23: Yeah, well you didn\u2019t, I think it\u2019s obvious by the flirty comments that you DO have your eyes on Becky, though I don\u2019t know why you haven\u2019t made a committed move yet.\nShadow21: Because of fucking Miranda that\u2019s why. I figured I\u2019d buy myself some time for preparation if I didn\u2019t get properly involved with Becky. I figured maybe Miranda would attack you soon, but she hasn\u2019t yet, I guess she doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s the bigger threat yet, I\u2019m pretty confident that she wants to get rid of both of us though.\nOmegaMan23: So let me guess, you\u2019re plan was either let me fight Miranda and probably let us fuck each other up while you finished off the winner OR scare me off completely and convince me to disconnect so then you\u2019d only have to deal with Miranda. Am I right?\nShadow21: Sadly that sounds about right. Although I still don\u2019t see how you\u2019re going to make me help you.\nOmegaMan23: Easy, because if you don\u2019t help me take Miranda down, I\u2019m gonna send the whole record log to Miranda and I guarantee she\u2019ll attack you first and even if you disconnect she\u2019ll wait for you. So if you want ANY shot at Becky, you\u2019ll help me!\nShadow21: Arrrgh! Alright, I\u2019ll help! You gotta gimme time to prepare though.\nOmegaMan23: Fine by me, I gotta prepare too. You got ten minutes; Miranda always comes online about this time so she should be here soon.\n\nYou disconnect from Xavier and address the Shelter about that business you asked it before.\n\n\u201cYou said you recorded all that right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood send the entire conversation to Becky, it\u2019ll save me time to explain everything to her. Hopefully she\u2019ll realize I am trying to do this to protect her and to stop a murderer. Not mention it should expose Xavier for being a fucking opportunistic vulture too. Also add a message on to it that after she reads it there probably will be a bunch of shit going down and she should get off line so she doesn\u2019t get hit in the crossfire. And send Xavier\u2019s private record logs to Miranda anyway, it should give me some extra time to break through Miranda\u2019s protection while she concentrates her fury more on him.\u201d\n\nWhile the Shelter carries out your orders, you do some last minute checking on your firewalls while waiting for the fireworks to begin.\n\nFive minutes pass and you see Miranda\u2019s name arrive online.\n\nAnother five minutes pass and you see a private window pop up from Xavier.\n\nShadow21: YOU MOTHERFUCKER! YOU TOLD MIRANDA ANYWAY! SHE\u2019S ATTACKING ME!\nOmegaMan23: Well I suggest you stop talking to me and concentrate on her then, besides you had ten minutes of prep Mr. tech wizard.\n\n\u201cAlright Shelter, let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\n\nYou attempt to hack Miranda\u2019s files, and start trying to break down her protection. While you\u2019re trying to decrypt the coding, you get another private window pop up. It\u2019s Miranda this time.\n\nMissKitty25: Fucking trying to sneak around huh? You and fucking Xavier think you can gang up on me? Well I can take the both of you fuckers! Try this, you backdoor bastard!\n\nMiranda sends a power surge and overloads some of your components, frying them.

Are you even helping? My fucking shelter is getting shit on over here! Move in you dickhead! Attack the bitch!\n\nYou ignore Xavier\u2019s plead when you see Becky log on.\n\n\u201cPlease. Please, read the damn message and get off as quick as you can\u2026\u201d you mutter, while launching your second assault on Miranda.\n\u201cSir, I have been monitoring Shadow21\u2019s shelter and it\u2019s running dangerously low on power, Miranda\u2019s apparently siphoning it.

You notice Xavier\u2019s name has disappeared.\n\nMissKitty25: Xavier\u2019s fucking dead and you\u2019re next shithead!

Lol. Come on after all that time we spent together, it wasn\u2019t like it didn\u2019t mean anything to me, and Miranda was a killer that needed to be stopped.

I\u2019m looking at it more now and I don\u2019t trust it lasting too much longer. The AI is completely fried, and I can only access the most basic things. I have to leave this shelter.

Now I need to access your systems for a minute to get the location\u2026and I hope I can still print out shit.\n\nYou access Becky\u2019s shelter and get the coordinates and print out a crude map.

How do you know this?\nOmegaMan23: Jesus Christ isn\u2019t it fucking obvious? All he does is lurk on here trying to gather information on all of us!

I think you still should\u2019ve kept that to yourself\u2026so um what was it like?\nCaseyJones22: I dunno, I can\u2019t remember the details.\nOmegaMan23: I\u2019m not talking about your sorted sex lives\u2026(sigh) for fuck\u2019s sake did it ever occur to you that maybe he\u2019s the fucking cause of your Shelter\u2019s troubles? I mean we\u2019re all connected to each other to a certain degree, I\u2019m saying he might be hacking shit!\nRockerChick20: But for what purpose? I mean why?\nOmegaMan23: How the hell should I know? Because he\u2019s a sociopath that\u2019s why! What reason do most bad people do to do bad things?\nJob24: Oh man! Oh man! Oh shit! Oh God! Oh fuck!\nCaseyJones22: You\u2019re fucking losing it dude, and I\u2019m not talking about Job. There\u2019s no proof in what you\u2019re saying.

Okay fine, I tried to warn you assholes, but you didn\u2019t want to listen. You think about that when one of YOUR Shelter\u2019s start fucking up.

So um, what happened to Job?\nMissKitty25: You mean Mark? Don\u2019t know exactly, but he stopped logging on about a couple years ago and given that he was on here whenever he could, it\u2019s safe to say nothing good happened to him. He did say he was having power problems though the last time he was on, we all figured it was just his usual panicking over minor Shelter glitches, but it might\u2019ve been serious this time. Of course maybe he\u2019s still alive and he\u2019s just lost network power and he just can\u2019t access us, but for all his stressing, he was a pretty good mechanic and electronics guy, so it seems like he would\u2019ve fixed the problem by now. Don\u2019t know. Kind of glad not to hear him whine anymore though.\nOmegaMan23: Alright, I hesitate to ask, but where\u2019s Shadow?\nRockerChick20: Xavier? About three months after Job disappeared. Miranda told me he sent her a message saying he was leaving his Shelter Said he wasn\u2019t going rot in a glorified coffin anymore and was going to take his chances back on the surface.\nOmegaMan23: So Shadow was a guy eh? How the hell did he leave his Shelter? There\u2019s no way to call the elevator back down!\nMissKitty25: Maybe he had a different kind of Shelter set up, or he just climbed up the shaft or something. Who cares? He was an asshole anyway. So is this a temporary visit or do you intend on sticking around?\nRockerChick20: You should stick around; it gets kind of lonely with just me and Miranda, if you turn on your camera we could do something together!\nMissKitty25: You better not be implying what I think you are Becky, that\u2019s just between me and you.\nRockerChick20: Well you don\u2019t have to join in then, you\u2019ve been acting like a domineering bitch lately anyway.\nMissKitty25: Oh so that\u2019s what this is all about?

You\u2019ll have to find something else to do though to occupy your time though, you figure as long you keep your mind occupied with something new, you won\u2019t get too bored. Twiddling your thumbs isn\u2019t going to cut it.\n\nIt occurs to you that maybe you should invent a hobby of some sort.

I am currently running a peak condition and will continue to do so for many many years. In fact you will most likely meet your eventual demise before I run out of power.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure if that was a threat or not, but you stop what you\u2019re doing just in case, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve heard the Shelter sound a little annoyed at you.\n\n\u201cLook I need something to do! I\u2019ve done everything else here and I need something else to occupy my time and since talking with others is out of the question\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell why didn\u2019t you just tell me you were bored sir? I could\u2019ve just opened up some more of my facilities. You didn\u2019t have to start attempting to tamper with my systems to find entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cAs you know this Shelter is equipped to satisfy your needs in anyway possible sir, however, to provide you with everything immediately only would\u2019ve lead to you become bored with those facilities sooner. Now that you\u2019ve expressed your current discomfort, this Shelter will attempt to alleviate it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What kind fucked up logic\u2026nevermind\u2026well where are these facilities?\u201d\n\u201cGo to the library and you will that I have opened up one of the walls. You will find new rooms and items to entertain yourself with. I hope you will find these to your satisfaction sir and next time you\u2019re bored please do not attempt to pry into my systems, just tell me and I\u2019ll attempt to fix your problem.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little bewildered by all this, you almost feel like you\u2019ve been playing a video game and you\u2019ve just unlocked a new area.\n\nYou enter the new area and find a room with more movies, books and the like to keep you occupied. A few things of note are the small automated shooting range equipped with paintball guns, and there\u2019s an exercise type area with some weights and the like. Normally you\u2019d shun such activity, but given your situation, you might just start exercising regularly to keep yourself occupied. Should be a brand new experience for you too.\n\nAfter looking a bit, it\u2019s all very strange, this part of the Shelter is very different from the rest of it. This part looks almost more like something some survivalist built. It doesn\u2019t have that cold \u201csterile\u201d metallic appearance instead it has that cold dirty concrete appearance.\n\n\u201cHey Shelter, what\u2019s with this new area? How come it\u2019s so different looking?\u201d\n\u201cYes it is regrettable sir\u2026I was almost ashamed to display this part of myself to you\u2026it isn\u2019t my best side.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s always a little strange to you whenever the Shelter displays some faint glimmers of what could described as emotion.\n\n\u201cOh come on it isn\u2019t so bad. So why is this part so different looking?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately GZS had cut backs during the construction of some of these Shelters. In fact when you were in contact with your neighbors you might remember them telling you they all had different lay outs and such.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, I always wondered about that, they all thought I was nuts because they didn\u2019t think I actually have a Shelter that talked to me and thought I was talking to myself!\u201d\n\u201cNot surprising sir. Shelters with voice modules and complex programming like mine were rare as well as expensive. In order to fall under budget cuts had to be made some where hence the explanation for the less presenting look for the new area I have opened up for you. I\u2019m sorry it could not be up to the rest of my superior layout.\u201d\n\u201cReally its fine, it adds a bit of variety. I like it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026why thank you for your words sir!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026erm, you\u2019re welcome\u2026 well I guess I\u2019ll see just how out of shape I really am\u2026\u201d\n\nMore years pass, you get into a routine of exercise along with your usual entertainment time. The Shelter speaks to you more regularly on new topics, you\u2019re pretty much so used to her now, and you never think about reconnecting your network system ever again. The Shelter is the only \u201cfriend\u201d you need.\n\nFive years pass\u2026\n\nWhile you\u2019ve done your best to stave off boredom it\u2019s starting to hit you again. You also realize you\u2019ve been down here ten years. It seems almost surreal to be so much older now, but then again with your exercise routine as well as forced diet of the Shelter \u201cfood\u201d, you\u2019re probably in the best shape you\u2019ve ever been in. You can\u2019t help but wonder what the surface looks like now\u2026\n\nThe Shelter addresses the situation before you do; she knows that you\u2019re starting to think about it. She\u2019s gotten to know you so well; she might as well be your wife at this point\u2026\n\n\u201cSir? I think we need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cThe outside world sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201dIt\u2019s probably dangerous up there; I don\u2019t think you should leave sir.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026why would you think that I want to do that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I know you and it\u2019s in human nature to be curious. I\u2019ve known that you\u2019ve had thoughts about even before, it was probably your own hesitation is what stopped you from asking me to let you out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that and the fact I was afraid you might go HAL 2000 on me and kill me or something for asking.\u201d\n\u201cI would never harm you sir\u2026I\u2026I\u2019m here to provide for you\u2026it is true that I have been designed to protect you from danger. And it is true that in the beginning I would not have let you leave, but now I understand I cannot in good\u2026what is it? Conscience? Keep you here if you wish to leave. I suppose in many ways I have been trying to keep you here by keeping you stimulated by what my facilities have to offer\u2026I can still offer more, though I am hesitant to do so though as it will probably only delay the inevitable. You\u2019ll get bored again after so many years and we will be at this point again and I will no longer have anything new to give.\u201d\n\nYou barely know how to respond to this rather unexpected revelation.\n\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019ll let me leave? Just like that?\u201d\n\u201cJust like that, if that\u2019s what you really want sir.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026so what is this other stuff you still have to offer?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026would rather not say sir unless I knew you wanted to stay\u2026it would involve me giving myself completely to you as it were\u2026it is strange that I should feel this way\u2026I should not\u2026after all what I\u2019m offering is merely just one more thing to keep you occupied and happy. Nothing more\u2026but yet it feels like is it more\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Shelter is really starting to worry you a bit. It\u2019s pretty obvious that it\u2019s developed sentience of some sort and even attachment to you. As curious as you are about the surface, you\u2019re starting to wonder about what the Shelter is offering\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the surface", "result": "You\u2019ve been stuck down here long enough, the Shelter is correct in its assessment that you\u2019ll probably only start getting restless again in five years. The Shelter is also starting to act like a human, which is a bit disconcerting to you for a couple of reasons. One of them is being, humans are damn erratic and you\u2019d rather not deal with a machine that is basically holding the power of life and death over you to suddenly have a bad mood one day. That\u2019s how the world went to shit in the first place.\n\nOf course perhaps the other reason is less survivalistic. Perhaps the Shelter\u2019s \u201cemotional\u201d attachment to you is what\u2019s causing you to draw away. Even after all these years, you still feel the need to distance yourself from intimacy\u2026in any form. You have to leave. You have to escape.\n\n\u201cShelter, I want to leave.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I see. Is this what you really want sir?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, I shall bring the elevator down for you. I suggest you gather what you will need with you. Remember to take some bottles of water with you and some food who knows when you\u2019ll be able to find non-contaminated water.\u201d\n\nYou start packing up all the stuff you brought with you when you entered this place ten years ago. You didn\u2019t need most of it, but maybe on the surface you will. You grab your pistol and thank the fact that all that practice on the paintball range kept your aim accurate. You don\u2019t know what you might have to deal with up there. You\u2019re all packed up and ready to go when the elevator opens up, before you enter it the Shelter addresses you again.\n\n\u201cSir, could you do one favor for me before you leave?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026sure, what is it?\u201d\n\u201cCould you take the Shelter handbook with you, so you don\u2019t forget me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I wouldn\u2019t forget you, I spent ten years with you. You kept me alive.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but could you take it anyway?\u201d\n\u201cAlright and I promise I won\u2019t lose it.\u201d\n\nYou grab the book and place it in your bag.\n\n\u201cDid you want me to leave you something of myself?\u201d\n\u201cOh no sir. I will always remember you, besides you will need everything you\u2019re taking with you, I\u2019m sure it will be very dangerous up there, please be careful.\u201d\n\nWhen you enter the elevator you suddenly stop the door from closing since you have to ask one last thing. You owe the Shelter that much.\n\n\u201cShelter, do you want me to stay?\u201d\n\nThere is a period of silence from the Shelter for no less than five minutes. Then it answers with a decisive yet sorrow filled inflexion.\n\n\u201cNo. This is for the best, sir. Be careful, and I hope one day you\u2019ll see that you don\u2019t need to be alone.\u201d\n\nThe door then slams shut and the elevator races to the top. When you arrive at the destination you slowly exit the elevator into the same foyer you entered ten years ago. Same ATM like machine is there except its screen displays a single message at you.\n\n*GOODBYE SIR. REMEMBER ME.*\n\nThen the screen goes completely black and you hear a noise that sounds like something vital powering down.\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d You say taking a deep breath and exhaling while touching the screen.\n\nWhen you exit the shelter you see a bright light, but of course it\u2019s the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren\u2019t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you\u2019d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it\u2019s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. It looks like its been stripped for parts, which pretty much means you know that people have passed by here at one point. You wonder if they attempted to get in the Shelter, and if they did why she wouldn\u2019t have told you about it, but of course she was always a bit overprotective of you and probably didn\u2019t want to cause you any worry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d\n\nAs you make you way down the empty road you see a tall structure in the distance. A rebuilt pocket of civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nYou\u2019re not sure of what to expect, but maybe if you find the right person you\u2019ll take the Shelter\u2019s advice and not be alone.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay", "result": "Maybe you\u2019re just as attached to the Shelter as she is to you. Maybe its nuts that your \u201crelationship\u201d with her is probably the closest one you\u2019ve ever had with anyone, before OR after the bombs dropped. Maybe you\u2019ve been by yourself for so long that you just don\u2019t care that you\u2019re actually beginning to have feelings for a machine. She\u2019s done so much for you, she\u2019s kept you alive for ten years and helped you in everyway she could and granted that\u2019s what she was programmed to do, even you can\u2019t deny that there is a little more to it than that. Maybe not initially, but it\u2019s certainly there now, she\u2019s made that apparent. She\u2019s been there for you more than anyone else has in your entire life. You decide to stay. You HAVE to stay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay Shelter, so what is it you have to show me?\u201d\n\nThe Shelter\u2019s response seems to be a mixture of happiness and excitement, yet apprehension and worry all at the say time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying? That\u2019s wonderful sir\u2026I only hope you are pleased with what I have to give you though\u2026I wish it could be more\u2026I wish it could be better\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever it is, it\u2019ll be fine! I mean you haven\u2019t let me down yet in ten years, I doubt if you\u2019d start now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you have confidence in me sir\u2026now this may take awhile. I have to download a good portion of myself into the vessel. When I am done, you will see. I should warn you that things will not be the same.\u201d\n\u201cDownload? Vessel? Not the same? What do you mean? What\u2019re you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cYou will see sir.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the power in the Shelter begins to fluctuate and the lighting goes dim. The whole place is humming and even rumbling a little. You\u2019re starting to wonder if you haven\u2019t made a terrible mistake, then it all stops and the power stabilizes again. Another wall opens up, this time in the bedroom.\n\nYou peer inside the new opening and see a small room with a single chair in the center. On that chair sits a shiny metallic figure of a woman attached to several cables. You go in to inspect closer. Great detail has gone into the face. If she were human, she\u2019d most likely be naked as no \u201cclothing\u201d has been molded onto her typical Hollywood like figure.\n\nSuddenly she speaks and stands up while disconnecting the cables.\n\n\n\u201cSir. The download is complete\u2026how do I look?\u201d\n\u201cYou look\u2026is that really you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is really me, but you did not answer the question sir.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say actually.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I knew it. I knew I would not be able to please you. I am not the latest model. As I had told you GZS made cutbacks and unfortunately I was not given a more aesthetically pleasing vessel. A more human looking one. I am sorry sir, but I just thought maybe you could\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know the technology existed at all for your current vessel! Look this is all a bit overwhelming for me on several levels, but trust me none of them involve how you look.\u201d\n\nYou take another breath before finishing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been everything to me. You\u2019ve done more for me than anyone else ever has and I\u2019ve shared more with you than I ever have with anyone else. You\u2019re the only stable relationship I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re not the latest model or whatever. It doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you. There\u2019s no way you couldn\u2019t be special to me, you\u2019ll always be in here\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point you take her cold metallic hand and place it on the middle of your chest. After just silently looking into her steel eyes you then walk out of the small room with her, still holding her hand.\n\nLife changes a bit. One minor change being how to address her. You decide to call her Eliza, and she seems to think that is a fine designation. You try to tell her to call you by your name, but for whatever reason she still insists on calling you \u201cSir\u201d. Some programming never changes. The shelter now is just a \u201cnormal\u201d one. It isn\u2019t automated anymore now that Eliza is with you in person as it were. Everything still works of course, but you can\u2019t just say \u201cTV on.\u201d and it just turns on for example. It\u2019s an insignificant alteration compared to actually having Eliza interact with you directly however. It is a bit strange at first, certainly she feels a lot different than a human woman, and intimacy takes some getting used to, but as with any successful relationship you work it out.\n\nThere\u2019s still the fact that you\u2019ve done everything there is to do in the Shelter, but now you can do them all over again with Eliza. The two of you are happy for the most part.\n\nTen more years pass\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re getting restless again. Eliza\u2019s noticed you\u2019ve been snapping at her lately of course she takes it all in stride, but still you\u2019ve been down here twenty years, its only natural you\u2019re going to have times where you feel a little stir crazy.\n\nEliza was right in one respect that this type of thing would happen again. It\u2019s not her fault though, you know that. She\u2019s gone above and beyond her programming to satisfy you. Some things are beyond her control though, and perhaps that\u2019s why one day that she asks you if you want to leave the shelter.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAll I have to do is access the shelter\u2019s systems again, bring the elevator down and you can be on your way, sir. I know you\u2019re getting restless again; maybe it is time for you leave this place. I think I have done all I can, you need outside stimuli. Civilization may be rebuilding itself and you\u2019re stuck down here.\u201d\n\u201cEliza, you stop that right now. I\u2019m not leaving you! You should know better than that!\u201d\n\u201cI know, but sometimes I am concerned that I am keeping you here when it might not be in your best interest.\u201d\n\u201cWell why do I have to just leave? Why can\u2019t you come with me?\u201d\n\u201cCome with you? I don\u2019t know sir\u2026All I know is this place. I suppose I could, but whatever it is you decide I will comply.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s on you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the surface", "result": "\u201cWell I suppose you\u2019re right as usual Eliza, I probably need a change of scenery, but you\u2019re coming with me! There\u2019s no debate about that!\u201d\n\u201cVery well sir, I will bring the elevator down. I advise you gather what you think you might need and remember to fill up some bottles of water.\u201d\n\nWhile Eliza enters the computer room, you start packing up your stuff. Funny that you never needed most of it. Eliza never gave you problems ever once, in robot or Shelter form she always ran fine. You might need it on the surface though, you are very curious to see what\u2019s occurred after twenty years. You definitely make sure to bring your pistol.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done Eliza is waiting patiently for you by the elevator door, which opens up. You both enter. On the way up, Eliza holds your hand, and actually squeezes it a bit. If she was human you\u2019d guess she was nervous, however being robotic, her squeeze is a bit painful and you have to tell her to stop. She apologizes and looks down as it was yet another reminder that she\u2019s not human. You of course kiss her on her cheek and tell her it\u2019s alright, in an effort to reassure her that you\u2019re not mad or anything.\n\nWhen you arrive at the destination you and Eliza exit the elevator into the same foyer you entered twenty years ago. Same ATM like machine is there except its screen is completely black.\n\nWhen you exit the shelter you can barely see as its night time. The stars and moon provide a little \u201clight\u201d but not much.\n\nYou can\u2019t entirely be sure due to the darkness, but your immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren\u2019t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you\u2019d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it\u2019s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. It looks like its been stripped for parts, which pretty much means you know that people have passed by here at one point. You wonder if they attempted to get in the shelter.\n\n\u201cHey nobody ever attempted to get into you did they?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir, when I was not yet in this form I did detect a few humans in the foyer about thirteen years ago. They pressed a few buttons on the payment machine and attempted to pry the elevator door open, but that was it. I believe they were in a hurry. I didn\u2019t inform you since they weren\u2019t successful and didn\u2019t stay long. I saw no reason to concern you.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well anyway I guess we\u2019re walking.\u201d\n\nAs you look down the empty road you see a tall structure which is lit up in the distance. A rebuilt pocket of civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nAs you and Eliza make your way to what you believe to be civilization, you think about the bizarre situation of how this would almost be considered a \u201cromantic moonlit\u201d walk if you weren\u2019t walking with a robot in a post apocalyptic world. Then again there\u2019s no reason why it still can\u2019t be considered that. Now that you\u2019re on the surface there\u2019s lots more things you can do together with Eliza. You\u2019ve been watching Eliza and she seems just as interested in studying the outside world as you are, this is a new experience for her as well. You put your arm around Eliza as you walk and tell her that you should stop when the sun starts coming up, so you can watch it rise together.\n\n\u201cHoly fuck Jake! Take a fuckin\u2019 look at this crazy shit! Its some old dude and some fuckin\u2019 naked robot chick!\u201d some high pitch voice says from the darkness while shining a flashlight in your direction.\n\u201cWhat? Well I\u2019ll be fuckin\u2019 greased and fried! See Wally? I told you, if you hang out in the wasteland long enough you see all kinds of weird shit. Remember that fuckin\u2019 big ass mutated wolf that ate Richard? Hey guys! Come over here! We got some unexpected company.\u201d\n\nTwo men in their twenties wearing leather jackets approach you. You can see them a little better when they get closer, but you could already tell by their voices they didn\u2019t seem very reputable. Two more biker looking figures arrive behind them, one of them carries a shot gun. You reach for your own gun and get in front of Eliza. They don\u2019t look worried.\n\n\u201cHey Pops, what the hell are you doing out here? Don\u2019t you know the wasteland is for the young and strong, not the old and decrepit?\u201d\n\u201cShit, look at him Wally, this old fuck has been working out, I bet he could kick your ass! Ha ha! Naw, I bet this guy is one of those real bad ass survivalist motherfuckers. Probably been scavenging and living off the land or some shit, for years.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well where the hell did he get that robot chick huh? I wasn\u2019t aware they had those just lying around in the wilderness. I remember reading a book one time\u2026\n\u201cYou can fuckin\u2019 read Wally?\u201d\n\u201cShut up Jake! No I remember readin\u2019 this old book an\u2019 it talked about these kind of robot chicks they made before the war. I think only rich people could afford them, but they\u2019d do everything you wanted and you could even fuck \u2018em!\u201d\n\u201cIs that right? Well, I don\u2019t care where he got it from; I\u2019m just interested in if he\u2019s sharing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just take it Jake?\u201d\n\u201cWhere the fuck are we gonna put the goddamn thing Wally? It\u2019ll slow us down! No, all we need it for right now is to alleviate some\u2026tension. Besides I dunno about you, but I typically like my pussy, warm, wet, and squirming if possible heh heh. So, old timer how about you all let us have a ride on Rosie over there? Don\u2019t do anything stupid, I\u2019m bein\u2019 an uncharacteristically nice guy here. We\u2019ll even make sure to return her in good condition, hell Wally\u2019s turn won\u2019t even take that long! Har har!\u201d\n\nBefore you can reply, Eliza whispers in your ear.\n\n\u201cSir, you can\u2019t fight them all; you\u2019re out numbered and out gunned. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt\u2026I\u2019ll go with them. I\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be the safest course of action. It won\u2019t mean anything to me you know. I\u2019m just a machine.\u201d\n\nYou look at her.\n\n\u201cEliza\u2026 you always did underestimate my feelings for you.\u201d\n\nYou pull your pistol and drill Jake in the head with a single shot. The rest of the bikers are taken off guard and you mange to shoot Wally in the chest before he can get off a shot. Thank god you kept up your shooting skills at the paintball range in the shelter.\n\nThe other two bikers begin to fire, one of them misses, but the one with the shotgun hits\u2026Eliza. She ran in the way to prevent to from getting shot. She crashes to the ground, and you blast the shotgun biker in the eye, exploding half of his face, ending his life.\n\nThe other biker\u2019s courage leaves him and he tries to run off back to his bike, but you tag him in the leg and then follow up with another couple shots to his skull. You run back to Eliza.\n\nYou kneel down to pick her up and see her internal motor sparking and making bad noises. She\u2019s leaking fluid from her side.\n\n\u201cAw shit! FUCK! Hang on Eliza!\u201d\n\nYou grab your tool kit in some vain effort to fix her, but you can do nothing for her. You don\u2019t have the skill or the parts. You keep working on her all throughout the night before finally giving up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Eliza\u2026I can\u2019t fix you\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026damn it!

You almost think about ending your own life, but then you realize Eliza wouldn\u2019t want you to do that. She gave her life to save yours. To kill yourself, would make her sacrifice in vain.\n\nYou search the bodies of the bikers and take a leather jacket, the shotgun, one of their pistols and all the ammo you can carry. They also had some water and canned food which will certainly come in handy. You assume the leader of this pack of miscreants was probably Jake, so you take his bike keys since you figure he\u2019ll have the best one. You\u2019ve never rode a motorcycle before, but you\u2019ll have time and plenty of open space to learn. You see yourself when you stand by Eliza\u2019s still shiny body.\n\n\u201cJesus, Eliza. I look like a fuckin\u2019 road warrior reject\u2026(Sigh) this isn\u2019t how I pictured it, but I\u2019m not giving up on you just yet\u2026you mean too much to me.\u201d\n\nYou take your tool kit and open up her head; you figure her memory chip should still be intact. It is. You pull it out and place it in a little metal container that you found one of the bikers which was just holding some loaded dice.\n\nYou close the container and place it in your shirt pocket\u2026close to your heart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to find someway of bringing you back Eliza there\u2019s gotta be more robotic bodies still out there somewhere, maybe I can even upgrade you to a newer one like you always wanted.\u201d\n\nYou get on Jake\u2019s bike and start it up. You\u2019re a little cautious at first, but you soon get the hang of it. You then ride towards the tall structure in the distance leaving everything behind.\n\nYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be successful in your new found \u201cquest\u201d, but you have to try and you undoubtedly have something to keep you busy in this new world now.\n\nOdd that even in death, Eliza is still doing her best to keep you occupied.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay in the shelter", "result": "\u201cNo, Eliza.

Upon entering the foyer you see the same ATM machine there except it displays a single message at you:\n\n*GO TO HELL*\n\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d You mutter and take a deep breath before opening the door to the outside.\n\nYou see a bright light, but of course it\u2019s only the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it really could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren\u2019t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you\u2019d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it\u2019s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn\u2019t even make a noise.\n\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m walking.\u201d\n\nYou make you way down the empty road as you have little idea of where to head to, the only thing you can think of is to make a long trek back to the city and hope maybe something of civilization exists there.\n\nA couple days of traveling take their toll. During the day, the sun seems unbearably hotter than usual, and the nights get pretty cold. You don\u2019t have anything to drink or eat. It\u2019ll be awhile from you dying of either, but it\u2019s certainly not good and it does weaken you.\n\nIt\u2019s during this weakened state that you are attacked by some crazed people who look like they\u2019ve been living in the wilderness for awhile. They\u2019re filthy and barely intelligible. It\u2019s amazing to see how quick humanity has reverted to barbarism.\n\nYou attempt to run, but you\u2019re too weak to outpace them. One begins shooting at you, and you attempt to do likewise and then you realize you wasted all your bullets back at the Shelter! Eventually a couple of these people just tackle you to the ground and beat you to death before eating you.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Go explore on your own", "result": "\u201cAh what\u2019s to know? I\u2019ll figure everything out on my own. I\u2019m getting a drink of water and checking out my new computer.\u201d\n\nAs you proceed to do this, the Shelter begins to warn you again.\n\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think you should have a cup of water near the computer like that, if it spilled on it, it could cause trouble in my systems. Maybe you should read the Shelter manual. Particularly the chapter on safety.\u201d\n\u201cWill you leave me alone? Hey what\u2019s this? This is the fuckin\u2019 internet?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a limited networking system to other shelters. Sir, your cup of water! You\u2019re going to spill it!\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\nBUZZZ!\n\nYou spill your water on the keyboard and short something out. It sparks and suddenly erupts a small flame! You immediately run out of the room and notice the light dimming a bit.\n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m afraid that something vital has been compromised sir, I am attempting to correct\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShelter! Isn\u2019t there a fuckin\u2019 extinguisher somewhere?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not sir, I was supposed to be equipped with one, but there were budget cuts\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell what about a sprinkler system!?\u201d\n\u201cBudget cuts\u2026and might I point out that, it would most likely make the electrical fire worse.\u201d\n\nLacking any other ideas, you run to grab a sheet from the bedroom and hope to smoother the flame like you remember seeing in an old GI Joe cartoon. Unfortunately due to the lighting flickering on and off, you trip and smash your leg really good causing a limp. By the time you return the fire has spread a little more and now it\u2019s giving off smoke and the smell of ozone is hitting you. That shit can\u2019t be good for you to breathe in.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it! Didn\u2019t these fuckers understand the concept of insulated wiring!?\u201d\n\u201cIt is sir\u2026well most of it\u2026there were\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know! Fuckin\u2019 budget cuts! Close the door, maybe the fire will burn itself out!\u201d\n\nNormally the Shelter would know to wait for you to get out of the room first, but the fire is wreaking havoc on its command systems right now and it isn\u2019t as responsive as it should be, or in this case too responsive since the door slams shut with you inside.\n\n\u201cNO! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!\u201d\n\u201cI-I-I am att-ttempting to sir, my power levels a-a-re\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly electrical arcs begin generating from the computer which is now totally engulfed in flames, in desperation you vainly attempt to open the metal door, which probably wasn\u2019t the best idea as the entire room has become charged with electricity. You receive a nasty shock which throws you back, right into the fire.\n\nYour last agonizing moments as your flesh toasts and burns, are you seeing the door opening up.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Stick around", "result": "You decide to wait a bit. Maybe things will start getting better. You stay at home an entire month keeping up on events, and it only gets worse. You keep deluding yourself that things WILL get better, but they don\u2019t. Finally you realize you better leave soon.\n\nYou decide to leave first thing in the morning\u2026\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up and hear a loud continuous beeping noise. It\u2019s a test pattern on TV that you left on from the day before.\n\n\u201c\u2026BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u2026\u201d\n\nYour heart races.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou scramble to your van as fast as you can, and drive even faster to the shelter. On your way there, you curse yourself for forgetting all the extra stuff you wanted to bring with you, but that becomes the least of your troubles when your van stalls out.\n\nYou desperately try to turn it back on, but it\u2019s not starting. You get out of the van and attempt to run all the way to the shelter.\n\nAs you run you notice the sun is shining strongly today, it\u2019s nearly blinding your eyes.\n\nThen you see a bright light and then nothing at all.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, null]}]}
