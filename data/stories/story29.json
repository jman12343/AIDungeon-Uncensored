It\u2019s the middle of winter and you both are assigned to guard duty. Normally, the cold isn\u2019t an issue. However, due to increasing demon sightings, a few unlucky bastards have to spend the night outside the city walls keeping watch.\n\n\nSnow begins to fall, and your cheap leather armor offers little resistance.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, I quit.\u201d\n\n\nLars tosses down his sword and walks towards the city entrance.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the demons?\u201d you ask.\n\n\nHe turns to you and a slight grin appears on his face.\n\n\n\u201cDemons? I welcome them with open arms. The city could use some heating up.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he leaves. It\u2019s just you and the dead silence of the night. You try to stand still and focus on the dirt road leading away from the city. This road is where nearby demon sightings have occurred. A few minutes past and you swear you saw a red flash. Your hands shake and your heart beat slows down. Is your mind just playing tricks on you? Surely you\u2019re just reacting to the cold, right?\n\n\nMere moments after this thought you hear a laugh. Unlike what you were expecting, this isn\u2019t the laugh of some badass demon. No, it\u2019s the laugh of a female. You try to tighten your grip on your sword but can\u2019t move your fingers. Shit, maybe Lars had the right idea. Spending the night out here is a death sentence, regardless if demons attack.\n\n\nYou can\u2019t bear to stand any longer and lower yourself to the ground. You drop your sword and curl into a ball. You don\u2019t have the energy to move a muscle and your body becomes stiff. Your eyes shut close and you\u2019re out cold seconds later.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a strong soldier like you doing out here all alone?\u201d a soothing voice inquires.\n\n\nYou open your eyes to find yourself staring at barely clothed succubus. She radiates an intense heat, although it\u2019s not enough to burn.\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Catia and you never answered my question. Why are you all alone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy other guard, Lars, left. Look there\u2019s his sword right there,\u201d you say, feeling compelled to give more information than necessary.\n\n\nCatia walks towards his sword and picks it up.\n\n\n\u201cIs this supposed to kill me? Ha! Don\u2019t make me laugh. Why is your equipment so poor?\u201d\n\n\nYou see no logical reason to tell a demon this but find yourself doing so instinctively.\n\n\n\u201cEver since demons came near our city, trade has been impossible. We have no experience with a threat this large and thus don\u2019t have the weapons or equipment to deal with it.\u201d\n\n\nShe grins and salivates to your every word. You take a moment to stare at her figure. She looks more human than succubi are told to be. Still, there are a few stark differences. These being her bright red eyes, dark red curled horns, and pink tail. Oh, and she utterly beautiful. More so than any human you\u2019ve seen. Despite being face to face demon for the first in your life, you feel entirely calm. Dare you say, the calmest you\u2019ve ever felt.\n\n\nThis calmness is ripped away when she begins to leave.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm? You want me stay huh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 I do.\u201d\n\n\nShe grins again and starts chewing on her tail in a seductive manner.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, no can do. But if you want, I would love to see you again. Trust me, it will be the most pleasurable experience of your life. All you have to do for me is one small favor.\u201d\n\n\nYou feel an intense compulsion to comply with her every demand, but you stop yourself. Making deals with demons is serious business. You have enough willpower to at least ask what the favor is.\n\n\nShe explains how if you want to meet again you need to be a more suggestive state, like you are right now due to the cold. She recommends going to a bar and drinking for a few hours. Then, all you have to do is whisper her name and she will come visit, provided that you\u2019re alone.\n\n\nShe walks away leaving you all alone. As if in a trance, you make your way to The Drunk Tortoise Tavern.", "action_results": [{"action": "A few hours later...", "result": "\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m saying this Greg, immortality is not worth cutting off your cock.

No wonder he wants immortality if all he has to do his cut off an inch or two worth of pecker.\u201d\n\n\nGreg suddenly stands up, drawing your eyes to the bickering trio. They\u2019ve been arguing random hypotheticals since you\u2019ve gotten here. All you wanted was to get a quiet drink before meeting with Catia. As long as these buffoons are here, that\u2019s impossible.\n\n\nEven as Greg stands up he\u2019s shorter than the other two sitting. It\u2019s no wonder they pick on him, he looks pathetic.\n\n\n\u201cCan you both just shut the fuck up? I mean, god damn. All I\u2019m saying is living forever outweighs the downsides of not having a dick,\u201d he says in a whiny voice.\n\n\nThe other two laugh uncontrollably at his pitiful attempt of defiance. One manages to calm down and spits out,\n\n\n\u201cMaybe when it\u2019s smaller than a gnome\u2019s toothbrush, but for the rest us it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d\n\n\nQueue more uncontrollable laughter as Greg\u2019s face becomes redder than demon blood.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll shove a gnome\u2019s toothbrush up your ass if you say that one more time! C\u2019mon, let\u2019s move on to another question.\u201d\n\n\nThe trio quiets down and you zone them out. You take a swig of whisky and start to remember the reason while you\u2019re here. Oh yeah, the succubus. She wanted you to drink a bit before meeting her. You didn\u2019t necessarily jump at the idea of getting drunk before meeting with a demon, but she promised you she would make it worthwhile. You\u2019re pretty sure that means\u2026\n\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted by the thickheaded trio once again.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019d prefer your child be retarded and kind than ingenious and mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes Connor, I would.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod damn it, Greg! You want to spend an eternity with no dick while taking care of a retarded child? Pathetic. I would kill myself after a week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHar har har! I would kill myself in a week if I had to live Greg\u2019s life as it is. No, scratch that, a day!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck you Tom. I can\u2019t be the only one who thinks this\u2026\u201d\n\n\nGreg glances around nervously looking for a savior. Eventually he turns his gaze towards you and his eyes light up.\n\n\n\u201cHey you over there! What would you rather have, a dumb, but kind child; or a smart, but cruel child?\u201d he says while pointing at you.\n\n\nYou stare blankly ahead and breathe a deep sigh. This is beyond stupid. You briefly consider just ignoring him and getting the hell out of this place.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you think that man would agree with you? He\u2019s a soldier. Surely, he recognizes the benefits a genius could provide for society. Especially when you consider the need for mages regarding the growing demon problem.\u201d\n\n\nSoldier? Shit you forgot to change out of your uniform. So much for staying inconspicuous. You can thank your lucky stars none of the other guards are here to see you in this shithole.\n\n\n\u201cNow now, let the man speak. Just because he\u2019s a soldier doesn\u2019t mean he agrees with you,\u201d says Tom.\n\n\n\u201cFine, what do you think...and hurry up!

And to think, I used to respect soldiers.\u201d\n\n\nTom and Connor start shouting about how much of a dumbass you are. You don\u2019t bother to engage with such idiotic banter. Instead, you walk out of the tavern without a second glance. As you make your way outside you are hit with a rush of cool air.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet Catia,\u201d you mutter to yourself.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Catia?\u201d\n\n\nYou turn around and only see the entrance to the tavern.\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErmm down here sir!\u201d\n\n\nYou glance down and instantly recoil. It\u2019s Greg, what\u2019s he doing here?\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d\n\n\nHe begins to squirm uncomfortably and hyperventilate.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I\u2026erm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpit it out!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to thank you for agreeing with me,\u201d he says between irregular gasps for air.\n\n\nOh, that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. You normally wouldn\u2019t mind but you have plans tonight and have no time for conversation.  \n\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t agree with you often kid? That\u2019s too bad,\u201d you say while walking away.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, I\u2019m 20. But yeah, everyone I meet either ignores or makes fun of me. I almost prefer the latter as at least they keep me company,\u201d  he says while following behind you.\n\n\n\u201cDamn that really sucks,\u201d you stop walking and stare him in the eyes, \u201cLook I\u2019d love to keep you company, but I have somewhere very important to be.\u201d\n\n\nGreg looks at you with a face of disappointment. But he lights up to ask,\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you have to be? Maybe I could come with you.\u201d\n\n\nGah! As bad as you feel for Greg, under no circumstances could he come with you. She agreed to see you, not Greg and you.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod damn it. Can you at least tell me why? I don\u2019t want to be near Connor and Tom right now. They make me feel inhuman.\u201d\n\n\nDoes this guy ever shut up? You been trying to exit this conversation gracefully since it started. You should just tell him to fuck off and be done it. Of course, you could humor him and tell him what you\u2019re doing.

He starts speaking aloud slowly asking,\n\n\n\u201cDo you think she was immortal?\u201d\n\n\nImmortal? Aren\u2019t all demons immortal, unless killed? You\u2019re no expert, but you have never heard of a demon dying of old age.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue to be honest. I was under the impression that her actual age is much more than her physical appearance would suggest though.\u201d\n\n\nGreg gives a nod satisfied with your answer. You feel like you\u2019ve told Greg more than enough and decide it\u2019s time to go. You wish him goodbye and feel a hint of longing in his response.\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye friend.\u201d\n\n\nYou tuck your hands in your pockets and begin the walk to your home. You\u2019re going to have to get home fast as the cold is unbearable. You decide to take the alleys, as not only is it faster, but it also provides protection from the wind.\n\n\nCommon sense says going through alleys at night isn\u2019t safest, but Ashton is different than most cities. Crime is low, and poverty is uncommon as anyone can get a job as a guard as demand is higher than ever. The night\u2019s sky combined with the tight spaced alley nearly blinds you. When you finally get out you\u2019re relieved to have arrived at your parents\u2019 house.\n\n\nMost guards sleep in the barracks, however, since your parents never returned from their trip their house is all yours. If they ever return, you hope they don\u2019t mind you bringing a demon inside the house. Although, they were always bugging you about finding a girlfriend, this might not be what they had in mind. \n\nYou walk to your parent\u2019s porch and open the door. The wooden door squeaks loudly as you open it. \n\n\n\u201cSome things never change,\u201d you whisper to yourself.\n\n\nYou immediately start making yourself more presentable. You change out of your soldiers\u2019 uniform and put on a loose-fitting black tunic. You probably should take a bath but your too excited to see Catia that you forget to. Do demons mind odor? \n\n\nYou feel like this is your purpose. It\u2019s time to see Catia.\n\n\n\u201cCatia\u201d.\n\n\nA dark cloud appears in your room, dispelling a toxic fume. You start violently coughing as you vision blurs indiscriminately. Your eyes shut close and you feel you grip on reality slipping away from you. \n\n\n\u201cAh shit,\u201d you whisper before passing out. \n\n\nYour eyes jitter open and you\u2019re greeted by Catia stroking your face. Her palm flushes the coolness off your face. Beads of sweat drip furiously down your neck as she continues caressing you. \n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t wait a single day before seeing me again? How cute.\u201d \n\n\nShe crawls onto your bed and moves closer to you. Her aura is all consuming and you feel your free will being drained away. Yet, the whole process is extremely pleasing to you. She moves her mouth to your ear and whispers,\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to see everything I have to offer?\u201d\n\n\nYou bite your tongue to avoid instinctively shouting yes.

As she does so, she unties your tunic and throws it off. Her warm body pushes against your bare skin as you are filled with euphoria.\n\n\nSoon both of you are completely naked. Catia pleases you in ways no other woman has or will ever be able to. Afterwards you both lay in bed panting as one thought races through your mind.\n\n\nHow do you get more of this?\n\n\n1 Month Later\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a month since you\u2019ve started having sex with Catia on a regular basis. The first few times you felt great afterwards. However, lately she has been demanding more out of you.\n\n\nFirst, you no longer have to say her name to see her. She visits you most nights whether you like her to or not. Last night she told you she wants to introduce you to a group: The Order of the Inferno. She told you they are a group of demons who could give you unimaginable powers in exchange for your help.  You protested as you feared what could happen. Demon attacks are becoming more common and more lethal. Their reputation proceeds them and stomps out any curiosity you have of meeting one.  Tales of rape, human consumption, and slavery are a few of many horrendous acts they have committed.\n\n\nYet, as always, she managed to convince you. As much as your mind tries to resist, her presence is intoxicating. You embrace it as fighting gets you nowhere. She tells you to meet you in a nearby forest tonight. This is the first time you're seeing her outside your bedroom since the day you met. You sneak out the city walls when no one is watching and blend into the shadows.\n\n\nAlthough it is still winter, the temperature has unexpectedly risen. Some say its because of demonic power, others view it as being coincidence. Whatever it is, the cold will not be a hindrance. You reach the edge of the forest and feel your heart leaping out of your chest. While the city has many focused-on demons, other creatures lurk during the night. Just because Catia is on your side doesn\u2019t mean you are safe. You keep this in mind as you take cover in bushes and flora periodically.\n\n\nAn intense red light comes into view causing you to close your eyes. You begin to stumble and fall to the ground. When you\u2019re able to open your eyes, you find yourself staring up at a hooded figure.\n\n\n\u201cWho dares disturb me?\u201d she hisses.\n\n\nBehind a dark brown hood lies a demonic face. Compared to Catia, she is clearly not human. Although none of that matters now, you begin to explain,\n\n\n\u201cCatia told me to come here. Are you part of The Inferno Order?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe sent a human to the center of The Order of the Inferno! I guess she wants to make up for earlier. I could never turn down a good meal.\u201d\n\n\nShe begins advancing towards you as a snake-like tongue hangs out of her mouth.\n\n\n\u2018Wait! She told me you wanted my help and would give me powers in exchange.\u201d\n\n\nShe begins to laugh as she towers over you. You\u2019re helpless as she grabs your neck and leans in\u2026 to kiss you?\n\n\n\u201cMy kiss is to die for!\u201d\n\n\nYou surprise yourself when you send a punch flying at her mouth. She seems equally surprised as she falls backwards.\n\n\n\u201cI guess I can still resist,\u201d you say.\n\n\nYou get up and start running away but it's no use. She\u2019s much faster than you, especially considering she can fly. You don\u2019t have many options left but need to decide quick.

How would a bunch of misfits pose a threat to the elite empiric army? As you to reason through it, your brain aches with pain. Damn that hit from Lars got you good.\n\n\n\u201cWell if he doesn\u2019t want to go through with the ritual then my work here is done,\u201d says Jirzan.\n\n\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d says Catia.\n\n\n\u201cEh? Do you want me to kill him or something? I thought you could use the practice.\u201d\n\n\nCatia sighs and places her hand on hip whist saying,\n\n\n\u201cWhat about instead of turning him into a demon we make him a Doom Knight? All you\u2019d have to do is teach him a little dark magic and we should be all set.\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t even know what a Doom Knight is and still don\u2019t trust Jirzan to teach you.\n\n\n\u201cYou think this imbecile could handle learning the dark arts? You have truly gone mad! And to think, they call me the lunatic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Zan, you owe me this. Backing out will only lead to more consequences down the road.\u201d\n\n\nThis seems to shut him up real quick. He starts cursing as it becomes clear to you Catia has something he dearly wants.\n\n\u201cFine I\u2019ll do it, under two conditions. The first, I will need his full consent to do the initiation spell. Without it, there is no way he could become a Doom Knight. The second, you return Coyote back to me once I finish.\u201d\n\n\nCatia nods and agrees to his terms.

Think of them as some sort of reverse paladin.\u201d\n\n\nYou always thought paladins were self-righteous assholes. They claim to protect others from evil yet persecute the smallest of sins.

Some demons are content with wreaking havoc, but others long for home. Take Jirzan for example, he couldn\u2019t care less about the underworld. He thrives of chaos and enslaves all weaker than him.\n\n\n\u201cThe only reason he\u2019s helping is because he has no choice,\u201d adds Catia.\n\n\nIn Catia\u2019s case, she needs to others to do her own bidding to prove she does not have to relay on brute strength. Lucky for her, succubi are experts at having others do what they want. By having you kill the captain, she can prove just how capable she is.\n\n\n\u201cMaking Lars believe you are a demon, and constructing a fake deal with him, proves how I can bend reality to my whim,\u201d boasts Catia.\n\n\nRegardless of what you think of her motivations, it seems the only choice you have is to follow her.\n\n\nWhat else do you want to know?", "action_results": [null, {"action": "What if I refuse?", "result": "\u201cYou should ask Lars that question.

Catia senses your hesitation and points out,\n\n\n\u201cThere is no need to be scared. Whatever Jirzan could gain from enslaving you is not worth what he would lose from me. Plus, you have no choice anyway. It\u2019s either agree to the ritual or be sent back to Lars.\u201d\n\n\nYou gulp and shake nervously thinking of the possibility.\n\n\n\u201cFine, I consent.\u201d\n\n\nWith that out of the way Jirzan explains the plan. He will perform the doom ritual and you will do nothing. Any attempts at resistance could interfere with the ritual and have untold consequences.

Conjured using the 5th edition of Dark Magic for Dummies and performed by yours truly.\u201d\n\n\nAs the flash from darkness fades away you are greeted by a creature from your nightmares. It stands at twice your height, with unorthodox body proportions. Its arms drag on the floor as it walks. It\u2019s grayish in color and appears faceless. It starts speaking again despite not having a mouth,\n\n\n\u201cWhy have you come here mortal? What is it that you seek?\u201d\n\n\nYou explain your situation and how you were sent to become a Doom Knight. It responds with uncertainty,\n\n\n\u201cYou wish to become a Doom Knight? This is the first time a human has come for that purpose. For good reason too, the moral confines of humans make the process a death sentence.\u201d\n\n\nYou react with contention,\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t care about moral confines, I have no choice. The demon who sent me here will surely kill me if I fail. Is there nothing you can do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is always something I can do. The only question is, can you live with the consequences?\u201d\n\n\nYou remain silent.\n\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t rhetorical by the way, do you believe you are capable of surviving? Despite feeling as if you have no choice, your morality still limits you. Hell, have you even killed someone before?\u201d\n\n\nYou continue your silence as you can\u2019t argue.\n\n\n\u201cLook, I could always use more prophets of doom and it seems like you are set on going through with this. I could simply perform the incantation and hope for the best. However, if you don\u2019t want to take the risk, I\u2019ll transform you into a demon. Not a traditional demon, but one like a less powerful version of me. You\u2019ll lose your humanity, but you will be guaranteed to become a Doom Knight.\u201d\n\n\nYour skin crawls at the idea of looking like him.

The hue expands until it reaches you. Your body goes limp and you start to float in the air. It feels like something is being taken from you.\n\n\nYour fingertips start to tingle. This feeling spreads through the rest of your body. You have no control over your body and remember what Jirzan told you,\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t resist.\u201d\n\n\nYou focus on your breathing and ignore everything else. An itching sensation spreads across your face breaking your concentration. The intensity increases as the ritual draws to a close.\n\n\n\u201cHaha, it\u2019s working!\u201d\n\n\nYou gain some control over your body and stare at the creature. Then you stare at yourself, your arms have paled and begin to stretch out. Your back contorts as bones impale your flesh. Layers of skin form over your newly grown bones. As this is all happening your mind begins to slip\u2026\n\n\nYou forgot why you\u2019re here and what you\u2019re doing. You crave destruction and serve a purpose greater than yourself. The transformation is complete.\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit I did it! I mean, you survived! Welcome to being a Doom Knight, I\u2019ve infused your soul with dark magic, so it should come naturally.\u201d\n\n\nYou stare back at this creature with a newfound kinship. This is your brother in destruction and chaos, you serve the same master and the same purpose.\n\n\n\u201cI will embrace this new title and destroy all who get in my way,\u201d you say.\n\n\nThe creature happily agrees and begins the process of sending you back to where you\u2019ve came. He says a few words and you are enveloped by a dark mist. Instantaneous you find yourself in a room with two demons.\n\n\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?\u201d shouts Jirzan.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but it\u2019s abhorrent, and that\u2019s coming from a mistress of hell,\u201d Says Catia.\n\n\n\u201cI am a Doom Knight, I bring despair and misery wherever I go.\u201d\n\n\nThey look at you in shock as if a sudden realization has overcome them.

However, you can consider your debt repaid if you help me send him to Ashton,\u201d says Catia.\n\n\nWhy does that word sound so familiar? You ignore any thoughts and familiarity and focus on your one goal: destruction.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you but then I\u2019m done. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll begin the teleportation process.\u201d\n\n\nJirzan snaps his fingers and you find yourself transported to a dirt road. You look around and see that this road leads to a city. You crave destruction and find yourself instinctively walking towards it. Your long, slender arms drag through dirt and scattered snow.\n\n\n\u201cNot so fast! All you're supposed to do is kill the captain,\u201d says Catia.\n\n\n\u201cYes, I will kill him,\u201d\n\n\nYou continue marching to the city, Catia takes to the air to catch up with you.\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have people seeing you or they might alert the guards! Anyways, I want you to meet up with Lars first. We need him to think you\u2019ve been a demon this whole time.\u201d\n\n\nYou continue marching drowning out the sounds of Catia as you focus on razing this city to ash. She starts tugging on your arm trying to stop you. You ignore her as she realizes her efforts are futile.\n\n\n\u201cGreat, just great. How will I ever return home if I can\u2019t get a fucking human to follow my command.\u201d\n\n\nJirzan comforts Catia and says,\n\n\n\u201cThis thing is no longer human. Its beyond our control and we need to move on.\u201d\n\n\nCatia and Jirzan start walking away but stay close enough to watch what you do. You reach the city walls and send a beam of pure darkness into it. It obliterates a ginormous portion of the wall, allowing you to easily walk through. Stepping into the city you feel a rush of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Everything looks familiar but your craving for death and despair is too great to linger on it. People scream as you break into the nearest house.\n\n\nA family is cowered in the corner completely at your mercy. Another man stands with a sword and tells you,\n\n\n\u201cLeave my family alone, monster! You won\u2019t kill them without killing me first.\u201d\n\n\nYou're more than happy to oblige at least half this man\u2019s request. You raise your arms and slam them into him. The cracking of bone fills you with vigor.\n\n\n\u201cNever tell a demon your thoughts and desires. Watch as I take everything dear to you.\u201d\n\n\nThe man pleads through raspy breaths as you approach his family. It's a mother and her two daughters, you waste no time sending a beam of dark energy into the three of them. They die before having a chance to scream. You leave the man alive to suffer a slow, painful death. Your body courses with adrenaline as you find yourself surrounded.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a group of about 15 armed guards armed with swords and shields. Their attempts at appearing composed are laughable. Every one of them fears you and you couldn\u2019t be happier. You decide to play around with them a bit,\n\n\n\u201cDo not fear me humans. I will leave this city and never return.\u201d\n\n\nA few look all too happy to take you up on that, however one-man shouts,\n\n\n\u201cWe will smite all that is unholy! If we make an example out of you other demons will think twice before attacking Ashton!\u201d\n\n\nWhat a brave attempt at defiance, too bad it is also insanely stupid. You conjure a cloud of acid and begin raining it down on them. The sound of burning fills your ears with joy. Some run away and the stupider ones attack. Swords pierce your flesh and you start to leak a yellowish fluid.\n\n\n\u201cONLY I KILL TODAY!\u201d you scream.\n\n\nYou flail your arms around breaking the bones of all you hit. Anyone who hasn\u2019t ran away are lying at your feet. You set their bodies ablaze and grin as they are turned to ash. The city\u2019s first line of protection didn\u2019t pose a threat.

I was on the same shift as him before he left. The windchill was approaching deadly levels and he decided to head inside as a last resort. I stayed out only because I feared the repercussions. As I sat out there, my muscles began to freeze until I could no longer move. I passed out minutes later.\n\n\nI would have surely died had a traveling merchant not stopped by.

You decided against telling the truth as Captain Dario is a hard ass for rules. Not only would you have been fired, but also forced to undergo a purging to ward off any demonic influences.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, you decide to head to a local armory. Your city issued sword is no match for a demon, as Catia pointed out. Not knowing if your parents will ever return, you see no problem with using their savings for your protection.

I just need something to protect you and the Misses.\u201d\n\n\nYou zone out their conversation and take a look around. They have swords, maces, axes, and even a trident.

You look where he\u2019s running and something comes into view. It\u2019s a succubus, but unlike the one you met before, it no longer resembles a human. It has blood stained skin and humongous bat wings. \n\n\n\u201cDie beast!\u201d shouts Andy.\n\n\nYou unleash a flurry of arrows at the creature as Andy is tossed to the ground. It manages to dodge almost everything, but one arrow grazes its foot.\n\n\n\u201cHOW DARE YOU!\u201d\n\n\nThe succubus releases a bolt of dark energy at you. It hits you in the chest and you collapse. As you sit there about to pass out, a thought comes to you.

Last time I checked you\u2019re the only one in the army,\u201d says Tom.\n\n\n\u201cYeah plus it\u2019s different. Orcs are uncivilized barbarians who kill all those they meet. When\u2019s the last time a human killed a demon unprovoked?\u201d asks Connor.\n\n\n\u201cDid you forget how this whole demon war started?

Jeez Connor, you say orcs are barbarians, but I\u2019ve met orcs smarter than you,\u201d Greg says.\n\n\nConnor slams his fist on the table making everyone jump a little bit.

Oh, and the fact you could kick Connor\u2019s ass without breaking a sweat.\n\n\nThe three of you continue discussing the demon war and the implications it as on the empire. Recent news of the capital being overrun has set the whole empire into a panic.

Do you think the city guards could even kill a single demon? I know it\u2019s just rumors, but word says our army is ill-equip to fight in the winter, let alone against demons.\u201d\n\n\nHow the hell does a guy like Tom know that? You stare at him trying to gain insight into his mind, but all he does in shrug. Damn, might as well give him your honest opinion.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a demon. Well, other than that succubus and she wasn\u2019t fighting me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo, is that a yes or no you bitch?\u201d slurs Connor.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\nThere is an awkward silence as you all realize how up in the air the future of this city is.

He got caught abandoning his guard duty last night and has been let go. When he tried to argue how unfair that was because he lacked equipment to handle the conditions all he was told was.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your own damn fault! The other guard did it without complaint.\u201d\n\n\nHe came here to drink until he passed out. Without the money from his guard job he has no way to support his family. He appears a bit more unhinged than usual because of that.\n\n\n\u201cI fucking hope the demons break down the city walls and storm the captain\u2019s quarters. I don\u2019t care what happens next. All I want is for him suffer a slow and painful death. That\u2019s what he sent me to last night and blamed me for saving myself.\u201d\n\n\nYou sit in silence not knowing what to say. He continues,\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which how the hell did you survive last night? When I left it looked like you were about to pass out.\u201d\n\n\nWell he\u2019s got that right. You briefly consider telling him about your encounter with Catia but the rabid look in his eyes tells you that\u2019s not a good idea.\n\n\n\u201cJust lucky I guess.\u201d\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t second guess you and continues his rambling. You pay little attention to his words and when you do it\u2019s clear he\u2019s gone off the rails.\n\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019ll rape his family and have him watch. It\u2019s what he fucking deserves, and he deserves what he\u2019s going to get.\u201d\n\n\nAs Lars drones on and on you realize how late it\u2019s getting. You better go home and get the hell away from this guy. You tell him you must go, and he just continues on talking to himself. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re here.\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably for the best. As you leave you give him one last look, and he looks back at you with a huge smile and twitchy eyes. That\u2019s creepy. You make your way out of the tavern and are hit by the freezing winter breeze. You\u2019re going to have to get home fast lest you pass out again. Best to take the alleys as not only is it faster, but it also provides protection from the wind.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t even get a few steps before you tumble to the ground, but not because of the cold. You are whacked in the back of the head with a glass. You fall face first, mouth agape, breaking teeth instantly. Blood seeps out of your head as you press your hand on the back of your skull. It\u2019s more caved in than usual.\n\n\nYou start hearing laughter. This isn\u2019t your first time hearing it either.\n\n\n\u201cAs if I believed you survived by pure luck. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t just kill you now. Now tell me the truth, demon!\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s Lars and he looks completely unhinged. You try to say something but just start coughing blood.

I know you\u2019ve been possessed by a demon; how else could you survive the frigid cold?\u201d\n\n\nClumps of blood continue flying out of your mouth as you fail to speak. Lars crotches down next to you and strokes your face.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, calm down. Like I told you before, or at least the non-possessed you, the city could use some heating up.\u201d\n\n\nWhere is this going?\n\n\n\u201cI want to make a deal with you! Kill the Captain and I\u2019ll let you live. Hell, I\u2019ll even give you something in exchange. Perhaps a part of my soul?
