Your oldest brother, Bagig, appears in the doorway of the hut.\n\n\n\"Dag!\" he shouts, \"Come on! We have an appointment with Lurkhim Deathforge.\"\n\n\nBagig stands at 6'4 and towers over you. His green skin ripples with muscles that make his black tattoos of wolves and bears ripple as his sharp teeth curve into a grin. Despite being a fearsome monster that would make most men run in terror, he's the kindest of your brothers and probably one of the nicest Orcs in the village. You nod, and eagerly rush over to follow him as he begins walking towards the center of the village.\n\n\n\"Now, promise me you won't tell Mama what we're doing. I can imagine her shrieking. 'Oh, Bagig! What were you thinking, giving a sword and dagger to an eight year old!' She'd howl louder than a dragon that's lost its tail!\"\n\n\nYou giggle, smiling at your brother.\n\n\n\"Still, you're an Orc, for fuck's sake! What does she expect you to do? We were born to spill blood.\"\n\n\nEventually, you come across the stone forge. Rows of iron swords, axes and maces are stacked there. Lurkhim appears behind the forge, working on a large war axe. She's heavily scarred from years of battle and forging accidents, her face being so scarred you can barely tell if she's angry or cheerful.\n\n\n\"Hello! Look who it is, it's Dagden Youngblood! You're getting so big, aren't you? Big enough for a sword, hmmm?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Lurkhim.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right you are. I had a sword twice my height at your age. Ran it through a neighboring boy who tried to take my apples, I recall. Ah, the days of youth.\"\n\n\nShe leads you over to the weapons rack, and picks out a tiny dagger.\n\n\n\"There. Try it out. It should be well balanced for someone of your height.\"\n\n\nYou look at the blade, filled with disappointment, and Lurkhim bursts into laughter.\n\n\n\"Ha! I'd be ashamed to give that to a baby!\" she says, grabbing a much larger sword from a rack.\n\n\n\"Here. Stain it red, Dagden. May your life be long and your enemies' short.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Take a few practice swings", "result": "You take a few swings of your blade.

A promising start,\" Lurkhim grins.\n\n\n\"We're not called Red Blades for nothing,\" Bagig says, rubbing dirt into the cut.\n\n\n\"Sheath your blade, Dag, you're not in a battle yet, despite how much you may hope,\" she says, handing over a tiny leather belt that looks custom made for you. \n\n\nYou put the belt on and quickly sheath the weapon.\n\n\n\"Now, shall we get you a dagger? A dagger for Dag? Fitting.\"\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, as she takes you over to a row of knives. You look through them.\n\n\n\"Go ahead. Pick your favorite. You can tell a lot about an Orc from the dagger he picks. Whether it's gilded or plain, big or small, large or short...\"\n\n\nYou quickly eye your favorite.\n\n\n\"That one.\"\n\n\nLurkhim laughs, picking it up. It's a deadly sharp knife made of bone, simple yet elegant.\n\n\n\"Ha! I like your choice! So many boys your age pick the biggest or the shiniest. You know what you want, Dagden.\"\n\n\nYou smile, as she hands you the knife.\n\n\n\"Keep it in your boot, so you always have it. An Orc should never be caught without a blade handy.

I have a damn many axes that need to be forged. Go now, Dagden, and make sure that knife tastes a lot of blood in its life.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Lurkhim.\"\n\n\n\"Of course,\" Lurkhim smiles.\n\n\n\"Come on, Dag, let's go home,\" Bagig says.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head home", "result": "You walk out of the forge, your new sword swinging at your side and you bone dagger tucked away in your boot.\n\n\n\"Now, if Mama asks, I was taking you to practice milking goats.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Bagig,\" you nod.\n\n\nYou walk along home, the same time Dendar arrives.\n\n\n\"Bagig! Are we still taking the twins out hunting?\"\n\n\n\"Damn right we are!\" Bagig laughs, leaning into you. \"Do you think I could get Gruzub and Mazkil to eat deer droppings?\"\n\n\nYou giggle and nod eagerly as Dendar bursts into laughter.\n\n\n\"Damn right we're getting them to eat deer droppings.\"\n\n\nBagig pats you on the head, before leaving to grab his bow and head off to hunt.

I can't wait!\"\n\n\n\"Now, you're only nine, but I think you deserve to go. The twins weren't allowed to go until they reached double digits, but they're idiots.\"\n\n\nYou laugh, and rush off to your room. You grab your warmest, toughest boots and put them on, sliding your knife in the boots. You grab your sword and sheath and put it on, finally grabbing the brand new Oak Bow that you've been practicing with every day you've had it. You sling it over you shoulder, as well as your arrow sheath, and rush out to meet Dendar.\n\n\n\"Hey! Where are you going without saying goodbye?\" Mama yells. \n\n\nYou stop, pausing to turn around and rush off. Papa and Mama sit in front of a roaring fire. Mama knits as Papa polishes his blade, as usual. You give Papa and Mama a kiss each.\n\n\n\"I love you both.\"\n\n\n\"I love you too,\" Mama replies, sweet as always.\n\n\n\"I'll love you if you bring me home a boar,\" Papa says, which causes Mama to gently stab him with a knitting needle. \"Hell, we don't need to say it every thirty seconds for fuck's sake. My Papa told me he loved me when I was born, when he died, and the day I bit out the throat of Lark Ramshead for calling Mama a whore. I still knew he loved me 'till the end.

You can sleep once you've eaten some bear meat and I've bandaged your wounds.\"\n\n\nOver the next hour, Bagig puts strips of bear meat on the fire, bandages himself and you up, and pours alcohol in your wounds, a procedure you'd rather not have done.\n\n\n\"It prevents infection,\" Bagig chides.\n\n\n\"I'd rather have the infection than have done that!\" you moan.\n\n\nBagig chuckles, taking a spit off the fire and tossing it to you.\n\n\n\"Go, eat.\"\n\n\nYou eat eagerly, finishing off every last bit of delicious meat.\n\n\n\"Now you're a true Orc, Dagden Bearsbane,\" Bagig smiles proudly.\n\n\n\"Is my name really going to be Dagden Bearsbane?\"\n\n\n\"Damn right.

A cloaked figure stands above you, a sword clutched in its hands. Its rotting skin is peeling away to reveal a pinkish flesh that the rot has already set into. You almost cry out in fear when you realize that its a an undead monster. It seems to be a zombie, although you've no idea. You've never had undead this far, and the sight of one is terrifying. You see Bagig awaken out of the corner of your eye, with a similar cloaked undead monster above him. Bagig roars, grabbing his bow as the zombie above you stab downwards, at your heart. You roll to the side, the sword impaling through the ground next to you, the cold blade slicing through your clothes and just scratching you to draw a thin stream of blood. The zombie stares at you and growls.\n\n\n\"NO! My brother didn't deserve to be killed by a cursed corpse-fucker!\" Bagig roars, firing his bow.\n\n\nThe arrow flies through the air and through the rotting head of the zombie, killing it instantly.

You struggle not to scream in terror, as you're tossed into the cart. Your small body sinks between two freshly-killed corpses, and Bagig is thrown on top of you.

How many hours? Hell, it could be over a day by now. Eventually, the cart stops. You hear growls outside, before a shout.\n\n\n\"How many?\" a young man's voice cries.\n\n\n\"Twenty-seven. Thirteen Orcs, thirteen Men, one Dwarf.\"\n\n\n\"A dwarf? I wonder what that small little bastard was doing in that region. Ah, who cares. Prepare them.\"\n\n\nYou hear zombies yank corpses from the cart. One of them pulls Bagig off you and you close your eyes and go limp. The zombie yanks you forward, and quite gently lays you on the ground. You open your eyes slightly, to see you're being laid out in rows. You're in the courtyard of what appears to be a massive castle made from black stone. You're surrounded by undead monsters, with one exception: A human, wearing hooded black robes, holding a steel sword. His face is paler than bone, and his angular facial features tells you there's probably some High Elf lineage in him. His black hair is slicked back undead his hood, and he eagerly looks at the corpses like a warrior among battle. An undead knight who had been leading the pack rides forward, looking at the man.\n\n\n\"Are you raising them, or is the Grand Necromancer?\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer. Papa's told you about him. A cowardly mage who uses raises the dead to fight for him. You know he has some lesser Necromancers, which probably included the robed man.\n\n\n\"No, I shall raise them today.\"\n\n\nThe Necromancer turns and raises his hands.\n\n\n\"Rise, Minions! The Grim Reaper shall not take you today! Shrug off the eternal sleep and wake!\" he laughs.\n\n\nHis eyes turn black as his pupils consume his irises and corneas. A faint blackness appears to flow from his fingertips outwards, enrapturing the corpses. The corpses begin to shudder as the black, magical energy floods into them. Then, the dead begin to rise. Slowly, the corpses begin to stand, their eyes still as soulless as before. The Necromancer pauses, spotting you. You attempt to stand slowly, like the newly created zombies, but stumble and fall flat again.\n\n\n\"Ah, someone from the land of the living is here! Hello!\"\n\n\nCold hands grab you, and you are yanked up. You crane your neck to see Bagig, holding you in his rotting hands. No, Bagig is dead. Bagig was loving, friendly, funny and kind. This... abomination, has black, soulless eyes. You draw your blade and sink it into the side of his head. Bagig's corpse releases you, and falls to the ground. Bagig has always loved you. His body deserves to rest.\n\n\n\"Ah, a fighter!\" the Necromancer laughs.\n\n\nRotting hands grab you, and the knife is ripped from your hands. You see several Orcs, seemingly alive, approach.\n\n\n\"What's the issue, Trant?\" one of them growls.\n\n\n\"My title is Necromancer Trant, servant of the Grand Necromancer. I will not be addressed as simply \"Trant\" by some lowly mercenary!\"\n\n\n\"Don't make me ask again, Trant!\"\n\n\n\"There's a survivor.\"\n\n\nThe Orc, apparently the leader of a band of mercenaries, looks at you, and you get a good luck at him. He's quite a fair bit taller than Bagig was, although his body is covered with scars. Several scars run across his face, including one that's taken out his eye, leaving a disgusting hole in his face.\n\n\n\"He's just a boy. I doubt he's been on his first hunt yet.\"\n\n\n\"Well, he should be dead,\" Necromancer Trant says angrily.\n\n\n\"I ain't killing him...\"\n\n\nYou breath a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\"... for normal pay.

Alright then, it's your head,\" the Mercenary Leader says.\n\n\nYou're dropped by the undead, and the Mercenary Leader quickly kicks you in the chest, knocking you backwards. You fall on the ground, and he grabs your arms. You watch with terror as a chopping block is brought out. One of the Orcs binds your hands with ropes, tightening them behind your back. You're shoved to your knees, and the chopping block is dropped in front of you. Your neck is forced to the chopping block. A bucket is shoved in front of you, no doubt for your head to fall into.

The one in the lead is a tall, pale figure wearing hooded black robes with silver trim with short black hair. His face is gaunt and his eyes are sunken into his face, giving him the appearance of a skull. He is followed by a small girl, who looks to be only your age, wearing a dark red dress with flowing blond hair. She's considerably less pale than the man, and has bright green eyes. She looks worried at the sight of the execution, and she very well might've just saved your life.\n\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" the tall man asks angrily.\n\n\n\"Nothing, Grand Necromancer.\"\n\n\n\"Nothing?

I'm so sorry that you and your brother got confused with them.\"\n\n\nYou don't look at the Grand Necromancer, out of disgust and hatred. You grab a turkey leg, and eagerly begin chewing into it.

I bet you've never eaten a meal this big, coming from a tribal village.\"\n\n\n\"I bet you didn't catch a single thing on this table yourself, and got stronger men to do it,\" you retort. \n\n\nThe Necromancer laughs.\n\n\n\"It tastes better that way, I would imagine. I admit, I don't catch my own food. I'm not a strong person. My brothers were the strong ones. They wanted to be warriors. I wanted to be a scholar, but after I began to research magic, I decided to become a mage. I quickly specialized in Necromancy. It has a terrible reputation like all other forms of Black Magic, but I've never understood it. Necromancy, Blood Magic, Creating Life, Elemental Darkness, Demon Summoning, Demon Bonding, deals with demons... Anything with demons, really, all hated by fools and morons. We hate Blood Magic because we can't seem to comprehend a need for sacrifice, we hate creating life because we seem to think that's the place of the Gods who barely exist and never help us \"foolish mortals\", we hate Elemental Darkness because the dumbest part of our brain is scared of what we can't see, we hate dealing with demons because we're too scared about our ability to keep control over them, and most importantly, we hate Necromancy because we have respect for corpses because of what they once were and fear the dead. It's pathetic. Do you know the amount of good Necromancy could do? Imagine cities defended by armies of undead, so hunting bandits and defending from enemies will no longer risk any lives.

I have business to discuss.\"\n\n\nBlaise nods, and stands up from the table. You stand, and she walks over and grabs your hand.\n\n\n\"Come on. I'll show you my room,\" she says.\n\n\nShe begins dragging you to a small door at the back of the room, and opens it. You find yourself in a large bedroom, bigger than Papa's.

My name's Blaise. What's yours?\"\n\n\n\"Dagden. My friends call me Dag.\"\n\n\n\"Pleased to meet you, Dag. I'm Blaise. I have loads of toys, but I also have other stuff.

Do you want to go to the garden?\"\n\n\n\"Sure,\" you nod. \"But won't the others be annoyed or...?\"\n\n\n\"They're all far too drunk to notice. If we're back in time for the dinner feast, we'll be fine.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and quickly follow Blaise, exiting into her room.

You walk along the tunnels, then the hallways, before arriving at the garden.\n\n\n\"The flowers are looking good,\" you mention.\n\n\n\"Yeah, they are.

I haven't see the Dwarven Mines, I haven't visited towns or the Kingdom of Man, or went to a real school. I've only ever had one friend in my entire life.

You also spot Balok the Honorless drinking mugs of ale and Necromancer Trant having wine in a corner. You'll enjoy butchering them, eventually.

She was the most beautiful baby I'd ever seen. The most beautiful human being I've ever seen. She's even prettier than her mother, may her soul find peace. When I met Annabelle, I thought I could never be in love more than I was with her. Blaise proved me wrong. I love Blaise more than anything in the world.

He says he has a newborn empire to command, and its slowly growing through small military engagements and negotiations, giving him more and more jobs that need to be done. You and Blaise continue to bond, although at this point you've both explored pretty much everywhere and done everything there is to be done. You've found the mass grave hidden under the kitchens, you found the hidden room filled with paintings under Dante's bedroom, you've even discovered the escape tunnel that links through the tunnels through a hidden door. You find it odd that the hidden door is only accessible through going through tunnels that themselves can only be accessed through hidden doors. You also devise many, many plans and ways to butcher Necromancer Trant and Balok the Honorless, though boredom is the main reason behind that.\n\n\nAlthough the boring castle stays the same, as you hit twelve and then thirteen, you change. As you reach maturity, you grow in size. Puberty hits you especially hard and early, even for an Orc. You become taller, larger and stronger as your muscle mass rapidly increases. You teeth sharpen, your skin toughens and your strength. speed, endurance and stamina increase. Your maturity also heightens your abilities in Blood Magic. Mr Nilvos tells you that this is natural, and your puberty is awakening your dormant magic abilities. This further helps you become the killing machine you've become.\n\n\nBlaise also matures, in different ways. Her magical abilities increase substantially. She gains control of her lightning powers, but those are pathetic in comparison with her necromancy. Her necromancy powers awaken and allow her control over the dead and the ability to raise them on a level unknown to her before. She's improving so quickly that she'll outclass her father much sooner than expected. She also changes in some other ways, that may or may not affect you in new and weird ways and awaken some primal part of you.\n\n\nYou sit in Mr Nilvos' Class, watching Blaise work. She stands surrounded by a circle of dead corpses, lying around her. She closes her eyes and begins whispering to herself, and the corpses begin to stand. They growl, and turn to look at Blaise.

We'll meet back here tomorrow and see what other undead monstrosities can be raised.\"\n\n\nStitches runs into the room, barking happily.\n\n\n\"Perhaps we'll kill the mongrel tomorrow,\" Mr Nilvos says, staring disdainfully at the dog. \"Dagden, practice your blood magic. Try to see if you can master breaking through a door when powered by blood sacrifice.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and follow Blaise and Stitches out of the room eagerly, heading straight to Dante's private Chambers. Tomorrow is the day of the Ceremony of Pledging. The various Necromancers, Mercenary Captains, Lords, Ladies, Mayors and Politicians who hold positions of power among the new empire of undeath are going to meet at Reaper Castle to pledge their loyalty to the Grand Necromancer. This means there's going to be a massive celebration and people coming from across the land, which will draw powerful and rich merchants from across the globe and all the goods and valuables that they bring, which can only be good.\n\n\n\"Dad! Dad!\" Blaise shouts, rushing ahead of you and arriving at Dante's room, before sharply knocking.\n\n\nDante opens the door, dressed in his Necromancer Robes.\n\n\n\"Ah, Blaise! Is your class finished already? That Dark Elf is getting lazier. Well, what is it?\"\n\n\n\"Have any of the Merchant Caravans come to supply the Ceremony of Pledging?\"\n\n\n\"Not to my knowledge.

Now, go along, They're in James' Barracks. I need to be alone, I need time to prepare. Some of the guests are arriving today, I need to get ready.\"\n\n\nBlaise nods, and Dante closes the door.

Don't do that!\" Blaise says loudly. \"Dagden, make him stop!\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack him", "result": "You charge forward, swinging your fist.

Don't you have servants to...?\"\n\n\nYou lean in to Blaise, interrupting the child.\n\n\n\"Please, if you say they all tried to kill you, I'll back you up, and we can use this as an excuse for me to murder everyone here.\"\n\n\n\"Hush now, Dag.\"\n\n\n\"I'm so sick of them.\"\n\n\n\"I know, Dag.\"\n\n\nYou continue watching the other children playing and talking as time passes.

You see one of the Vampire Lords on her knee in front of him.\n\n\n\"I pledge my life, my body, my soul, my land and my people to you, King Dante, Grand Necromancer and Master of the Dead.\"\n\n\nDante nods, placing a hand on her shoulder. She stands, and goes to sit down. The Grand Necromancer stands as the room goes quiet.\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Living and Dead, Leaders and Warriors, today you have...\"\n\n\nAn undead, armored warrior bursts through the heavy double doors of the main hall.\n\n\n\"Sir! They've attacked!\" he roars in a deep, mangled voice.\n\n\n\"What's the situation?\" Dante asks.\n\n\n\"The Kingdom of Man, the High Elves, the Wood Elves, the Dark Elves, the Dwarf Clans, the Orc Tribes, they've all sent large forces to assault the edge of the Empire. They say you're an enemy of the gods and an unnatural monster that needs to be destroyed. They're invading!\"\n\n\nDante laughs.\n\n\n\"The Elves and the Kingdom of Man have joined forces? That shows how terrified of this new world I'm trying to create they are. We outnumber them. What is the issue? Have our armies sent out. I want all the undead guards of the towns and cities of my empire, including this castle, sent out with whatever mercenaries we can muster to wipe out these armies. Hell, it's easier, having them all in one place. Today we'll have a crucial victory to make my conquest certain.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Revenant says, before turning and walking out the door.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the undead soldiers and warriors in the room, as well as many of the mercenaries, stand up and begin marching out the doors, leaving behind a token guard force.\n\n\n\"Go forth and slaughter, my men!\" the Grand Necromancer laughs. \"Go, wipe out my enemies!\"\n\n\nYou look around, to see the room is much more empty now. Necromancer Trant and Balok the Honorless are still here, so at least they won't be killed by some human instead of you.\n\n\n\"Well... That destroyed my speech. Well, fuck. I'll start again, even though half the crowd has left.\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer clears his throat and starts again.\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Living and Dead, Leaders and Warriors, today you have pledged yourselves to me. Today you have pledged yourselves to my empire. We will build a better world. Through the Path of Death, we will create a new world of life. With one leader, we won't need war. With an army of undead, we won't need town guards to hunt down criminals and risk their lives. To protect us from threats we'll have an army that requires no food or rest. You children, your sons and daughters, will not be sent out to fight and die. In pledging to me, you've pledged to have your children protected! In death, your body will be raised again to protect your family, and if you wish, your soul may stay as well. There will be no corruption in me, for once I embrace undeath and become a Lich, I will have no need for physical pleasure, I will live on through death to carve this empire and keep it going for an infinite number of generations. We will have the perfect world. The homeless will be housed, the sick healed and the starving fed. The dead will be risen! We fight for the perfect world! Our Empire will become the envy of the living, the dead and the Gods! We will create the perfect world! An end to poverty, an end to starvation, at end to racism, at end to sexism, an end to suffering, an end to death! You have joined me, and I swear, the Reaper will take me from to the grave before I let that vision crumble! Follow me past the obstacles of death and the enemy! We will create the new world! We march down the Path of Death towards a future of living and joy!\"\n\n\nThe room breaks into applause, and you follow through. You have to agree, Dante paints a fair picture of the perfect world. You understand why so many people are following him.\n\n\n\"Alright, bring out the food! Let's feast!\" Dante shouts, before pausing. \"Oh, yes... Most of the servants are gone. Curse the Gods, this isn't going as well as I had planned. Are there any servants even left? Oh, here's a few. Go, bring food.\"\n\n\nSlowly, the few undead remaining fetch massive plates of food and bring them out.\n\n\n\"So, did you like my Dad's speech?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, it was good. I liked it.\"\n\n\n\"Good. I hope he gets to achieve his dreams of the perfect world, though I am realizing I'm not really the heir to his throne if he does become immortal.\"\n\n\nThe food arrives, and you begin to eagerly dig into a plate of chicken. You gobble it down happily, before chugging down several mugs of ale. After about an hour of feasting, you feel sick, bloated and drunk.\n\n\n\"I don't feel great,\" you moan.\n\n\n\"You're drunk,\" Blaise says.\n\n\n\"No I'm not. You're drunk. Stop lecturing me, you drunk!\"\n\n\n\"I've had one cup of spiced wine. You've had loads of mugs of ale.\"\n\n\n\"I've been drinking water. You're drunk. Stop drinking.\"\n\n\nBlaise laughs, as you decide to rest your head on the table.\n\n\n\"You're not even fun drunk. You're sad drunk,\" Blaise says. \"You're only thirteen. You shouldn't be drinking this much.\"\n\n\n\"You're only thirteen. You shouldn't be so mean.\"\n\n\nBlaise pats you on the back. \n\n\n\"Come on, let's get you to bed.\"\n\n\n\"It's only Six O'Clock!\"\n\n\n\"It's Eleven O'Clock, Dag.\"\n\n\n\"Oh.

The community\u2019s large enough that there\u2019s always something new to do unlike back with Reaper Castle, and you begin to learn all of the town\u2019s secrets. The hidden stash of hallucinogenic mushrooms that you learn belongs to old Mrs DeAngelo, the old scouting tunnels that were used to spy for enemies, the barred off Dwarven Mines that lead to a nesting ground for bats, even the secret room behind the school that\u2019s being used as a distillery of a cheap knock off of Dwarven Mead. The heat for Blaise lasts for longer than expected, with some light patrols and even some wandering Heroes arriving in search for two refugees. Still, they\u2019re easy to hide from with the help of Tholi. As time passes on you begin reading some of the many books that fills the great library that Tholi has collected over the years, with your interests including the making of a fine ale to the history of the Orcish Tribes off towards the cold, inhospitable Northern mountains. You practice with your weapons and Blood Magic everyday, and Blaise eagerly collects any bandit corpses or dying carcasses to bring back to life and train with, before eventually allowing them to depart from this realm once she\u2019s finished. The time flies incredibly quickly. You wait patiently as fewer and fewer faces arrive looking for Blaise, and to a much lesser extent, you. The large WANTED: NECROMANCER posters that once plastered the town slowly give way to newer and more important issues, such as WANTED: BANDIT CHIEFTAIN or WANTED: FORGER as Blaise\u2019s name fades from the headlines. As well as this, you can tell from Newspapers that the so called \u201cAlliance\u201d has fallen apart without a threat to unite against. Orc Raiders attack human communities, humans expand into Orc territory, the Dwarves stay as xenophobic and isolated as ever and tension flares within the Elves as the Wood Elves demand peace, the Dark Elves embark on business ventures and mercenary works for the enemies of the Elves and the High Elves try to expand their empire. This quickly leads to infighting, before the Alliance falls apart. Minor skirmishes break out as soldiers class along changing borders. Not only is the Alliance dead, it\u2019s only a matter of time before wars break out. Still, this has little effect on the tiny community of Kashin, which continues to act as a home for the various Undead, Exiled and Scum of this plane.\n\n\n\u201cDagden! I need you to head out with Blaise to the market!\u201d Tholi yells from across your stone home.\n\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d you reply with a shout.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new shipment of flowers, fertilisers and seeds. I need you to pick it up from Mr Tabernius. There\u2019s coin and breakfast by the table. I\u2019ve left some extra money for whatever you feel like doing, around 100 coins.\u201d\n\n\nOf course it\u2019s flowers and other gardening stuff. What else could it possibly be? Tholi is, quite ironically, a Plant and Life Mage. Blaise\u2019s love of gardening, which again is incredibly ironic for a master of death, has only got them to get along better than ever. The massive greenhouse, which is one of the few buildings that goes above ground in Kashin, is an impressive thing to behold. Through magic, skill and a lot of hard work, she\u2019s made an incredible and very impressive garden. From what you\u2019ve heard, Tholi\u2019s made quite a bit of coin selling impossible to find herbs to the Merchant Caravans. You clamber out of your bed and quickly get dressed in a rough woolen tunic, before walking downstairs. Blaise sits there, eating a bowl of grapes. A second, untouched bowl sits next to her, which you eagerly grab and begin to dig into. You toss one to Stitches, who lies on the ground off to the side, half-asleep. You shovel the plump purple grapes into your gob, as Tholi appears.\n\n\n\u201cGood morning,\" she says cheerfully.\n\n\n\u201cWhat flowers are coming in, Tholi?\u201d Blaise asks eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s some Purple Dragon Tongue, Silver Bells, Sunshine Pitchers, Black Roses and some Daffodils, I think. You\u2019d be surprised how hard it is to find good daffodils.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCool,\" Blaise says, pushing her empty bowl away. \u201cAre you ready, Dag?\u201d\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, your mouth full. You stand, pop on your boots, and begin heading out the door. Blaise grabs the bag of coins, and you walk with her. At this stage, you both know the town like the back of your hand. You pass the Grave, an Inn who\u2019s primary market are the many undead who once served Dante and now hide, scared to lose their \u201clives\u201d for a second time in their existence. You pass the Silver Chalice Tavern, Da\u2019qiq\u2019s General Store and several large stone homes build into the caves. You look up at the stone roof that would\u2019ve plunged the cavern into darkness without the massive and numerous torches that covered the cavern walls and every building inside. You eventually find yourself at Mr Tibernius\u2019 Master Store. The building is unoccupied nine months of the year as Mr Tibernius travels across the world and, according to some, visits other planes of existence, collecting everything from ornate candlesticks to dark tomes that speak the name of creatures that could burn this world to ash if they simply noticed it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go inside", "result": "You walk inside, pushing open the dusty door.

Massive glass walls enclose a large room filled with every plant imaginable. It makes Blaise\u2019s garden look like a weed growing out of a clump of dirt. Rows of roses, various small trees, endless amounts of shrubs, berry bushes, flowers and other fine pieces of greenery. In the center, standing perfectly still and fast asleep, is a Life Elemental. The massive, nine foot figure seems to be a massive talking tree with wooden arms and legs, with leaves and flowers growing from it\u2019s body. It\u2019s face, which looks like a master wood carver has carved it into the bark, is closed and asleep, with leaves growing across its chest that go up and down as it snores. An Elemental is a creature that is the embodiment of a magical element, in this case life, that has no morality besides the spreading of its own element. Because of this, Life Elementals are relatively pacifistic, although the issues they cause, such as destroying buildings to make room for plant life, digging up corpses for fertilizer and wiping out any loggers in the area make it an unwelcome guest to all but the Wood Elves. Still, since Tholi has managed to keep this one relatively tame, she\u2019s allowed to use it as a gardener and a last line of defense should the house be attacked. You stare at the horrible be plant-beast, having some hate for it, but Blaise simply walks up to it and rubs it\u2019s side. It\u2019s eyes open, pure black, and Blaise slowly checks the various plants that make up its body for infection or disease, before letting the Elemental sleep again.

Topics ranging from how Kai\u2019s transformations were going to how Sir Trent was coping without necromantic power being given to him by the Grand Necromancer to the state of Kashin. Eventually, Blaise asks a question.\n\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Blaise asks, and Sir Trent launches into the long explanation he told you.\n\n\n\"So... where are we going?\" you ask once Sir Trent finishes.\n\n\n\"Lady Blaise is in charge.\"\n\n\nBlaise nods, thinking.\n\n\n\"We don't have time to think.

You grab your Blood Stone, your sword, Mort and his bronze cage, you dagger, your boots and everything else you have, cramming it into a leather satchel and popping Mort on your shoulder. You walk downstairs again and fine Blaise, tears streaming down her face while she embraces Tholi, with a leather bag at her side and Stitches licking the side of Kai's face.\n\n\n\"I'm going to miss you so much!\" Blaise cries, now having to bend down to cry into Tholi's shoulder.\n\n\n\"I'll miss you too, sweetheart.

It has sharp, dark green thorns curving upwards coming from the stem, and beautiful black petals forming an intricate cupping shape, with a beautiful blood red pistil. Light reddish brown pollen gently lifts from the anthers into the air around it, carrying a scent like cooked meat, which is odd for a flower.\n\n\n\"It's...\" Tholi begins.\n\n\n\"It's your Death's Head Flower!

Since parts of the Dead Empire were given to all who fought and none could agree on who to give Reaper Castle to, they simply left it abandoned. Still, in this recent time of friction they each have large forces nearby, ready to take Reaper Castle in the event of war or another race trying to capture it. The Castle itself should still be structurally sound and mostly fine, it\u2019s only been two years. Still, between the various bandits staying there, the few undead that were left behind and have no doubt gone feral and any other scum that\u2019s taken up residence there, it will be some effort to take back,\u201d Sir Trent says.\n\n\n\u201cWe can do it,\u201d Blaise says, looking uncertain.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we will,\" you reply.\n\n\n\u201cYou two better get some sleep.

He pushes open the gates, which are unbarred. Kai tosses his machete aside with a laugh. He lets out a long laugh, which turns to a yell as his body begins to twist and break. His bones snap as his limbs stretch wider and his head and body grows. His face is torn apart as his teeth grow and sharpen past their usual point. Hair sprouts from his body. The Werewolf howls, and immediately bursts into the castle, sprinting straight down the halls of one of the barracks.\n\n\n\"Stay away from Kai until he changes form.

Any Alliance Soldiers who died are gone, having been taken out and buried, burned or eaten as per their cultures tradition, leaving only the undead, necromancers and mercenaries' corpses. Blaise pauses, and through the hall four of the dead stand.\n\n\n\"I can't raise any more. Most have been stabbed through the head and heart by the Alliance to make sure they can't be risen.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and walk along the wall.

Nailed to the black, obsidian throne is the rotting, cloaked body that you recognize is Dante only from the cloak. His head sits in his lap, a bloody iron crown with nine black gems built into it resting on his head.

He looks terrified as he listens to the roars of Kai as he tears through whoever's in the next barracks, as well as the moans and gasps of Blaise's new undead group.\n\n\n\"FUCK! We're under attack!\" he shouts.\n\n\nHe retreats inside, and you hear yells, shouts and calls to action from inside the barracks. A minute later, two dozen Bandits rush out wielding swords or knives. A particularly small one, one of the few clean-shaven Dwarves you've seen, steps forward.\n\n\n\"Who the fuck are you?\" he says, quite elegantly in your opinion.\n\n\n\"Blaise.

A bolt of lightning flies from it, hitting the Bandit leader in the stomach. He screams, shudders, and collapses backwards. There's an awkward moment of silence, before the Bandit leader rises.

He pants are torn and he's covered with blood.\n\n\n\"That was fun,\" he smiles.\n\n\nYou stare at him for a moment, before the final bandit screams.\n\n\n\"Now that that's done, into the final section of Reaper Castle,\" Sir Trent says.\n\n\nYou look at the final section.

Sir Trent quickly opens the door, raising his sword to protect himself from any unknown attack. You look inside, and see a fascinating and terrifying sight. Two figures are in the room. The first is kneeling in a circle of candles. He's a large, light green creature whose large, muscular chest and both sharp and rough features indicate he is a Half-Elf, Half-Orc. His body is covered with large, deep scars, and he looks like he's been torn apart before. His hair is bound into a large lock, the rest of his scalp bare. The other figure you recognize immediately.

Then we got barricaded in here by two Paladins, and the demons turned on me. There's one of them,\" he says, pointing to Soren. \"The only demon who stayed loyal to me was Malign. The demons decided to punish Malign, so they forced him into the Paladin's body and trapped him in the circle, knocking me out and using my energy to keep it going.

Eventually, you manage to understand the situation. Mr Nilvos has been unconscious, all his energy being put toward the circle trapping Soren/Malign, so you give him some time to gather his thoughts.

No one must have found it during the looting. The armor was in one of the abandoned rooms.

Six are around your age or a bit younger, with eight being just into their teens, and a final six who have barely passed Blaise\u2019s set age limit. Most are humans, with a few exceptions; there\u2019s a Wood and High Elf who are both barely passing the age limit, an Orc slightly younger than you, a High Elf that\u2019s your age and two Dark Elves just into their teens as well as one your age.

I\u2019m impressed you notice, so you can keep yours. Everyone else, line up.\u201d\n\n\nYou manage to scare off another three kids, bringing the total down to thirteen. You draw your dagger, and are faced with the tiny Wood Elf boy. He has short, combed brown hair and bright green eyes.

You have to admit, he has balls. You draw your bone dagger, holding it to the Wood Elf\u2019s ring finger. He doesn\u2019t flinch.\n\n\n\u201cFuck it, kid. You\u2019ve got a pair on you, you know that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA pair of what?\u201d\n\n\nYou roll your eyes with a snicker at his naivety.\n\n\n\u201cGo stand with the other Elf. You can keep your finger.\u201d\n\n\nThe Wood Elf smiles and happily bounds off. You\u2019re then faced with a tall girl around your age.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to cut off our fingers.
