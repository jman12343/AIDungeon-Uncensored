Or was it something else?\n\nIt's easy to blame the humans who live beneath you, blame them for every little thing that goes wrong in the world.

No wonder the wind was so strong up here: you must be hundreds of metres above sea level...\n\nYou\u2019ve never been on an airship before, but you have seen plenty of them at the island where you lived all your life. Some sky races use these aerial vessels to transport goods and cargo between islands, others simply for transporting passengers. However, they can be slow and unwieldy to operate, and they are not especially durable; a fierce lightning storm can easily put an airship out of commission.

They are not human, but then again...neither are you. Each of them appears to be armed to the teeth. Only now do you realise that they must be part of the ship's crew.\n\nAfter a few minutes, your guide leads you to a brass door which lies at the top of a final flight of stairs.

One device consists of two gyros oscillating in synchronisation with each other, surrounded by a shimmering coil of energy; another instrument is similar to a telescope upon first glance, but appears to contain three lens of varying sizes at set intervals within its interior; a third device resembles a sundial, but is set into the ceiling and is covered by an array of round discs. Evidently, these instruments must be related to the operation of the airship. You\u2019re not sure whether they are lifelike models of the real thing or not, but they do fascinate you.\n\nFrom the look of the place, you must be in the captain\u2019s room. Sunlight pours in through two bay windows at the front, and a plain-looking bed is situated in the corner next to a pair of filing cabinets. This cabin seems to function as both a workspace and as living quarters. A large number of medals and trophies stand upon one of the cabinets.\n\nThe captain herself stands at the other end of the cabin behind a large desk, dressed in a red and purple uniform covered by various badges to indicate her high status. Much like the other crew members you saw earlier, she is not human and is vaguely reptilian in nature.

She turns towards you haughtily and clears her throat.\n\n\u201cHow about\u2026this?\u201d she says irritably. \u201cYou do not speak Common Tongue, or even Uncommon Tongue. A mix of Skylandish and Common Comorrah? Is this really how you talk to your brethren? You Unworthy ones are nothing but a constant pain.\u201d\n\nSeeing that you understand her, she sags back against her chair with some relief. \u201cI see that we have some communication in place at last. I am the captain of this ship. I will make a few things clear right now, Unworthy \u2013 I do not tolerate stowaways who drop out of the damn sky, taking up additional resources than I can spare for my crew.

She must be quite tired after her ordeal. Her island is not the first to plummet towards the ground, nor will it be the last. An exchange of information is required.\u201d\n\nThe captain glares at you, but reluctantly acknowledges her words. \u201cVery well,\u201d she says. \u201cUnworthy, you are free to ask me questions about your situation.

These vessels are not built for long journeys, as you may know. Although the Tenurs work on the advanced mechanisms, it is not mandatory to employ them as members of the crew and we carry no Tenurs aboard at this time.\u201d\n\nShe appears to be referring to the races which populate the various sky islands.

Unworthy, we carry a decent amount of cargo on board and I will not have your presence contaminate the merchandise further. I will be glad to be rid of you.\u201d\n\nThis news brings you some hope. It sounds as if you might have a chance to reach an island not unlike the one you left behind. That seems a sensible way to proceed right now: move on, rebuild, and re-settle upon a new island.

Not the safest choice, but we are already stretched to full capacity here.\u201d\n\nYou recall the mutant you saw in your room. \u201cPrisoner?\u201d you repeat.\n\n\u201cCargo is not the only thing we transport on this airship,\u201d she states. \u201cOccasionally we are given the task of transporting valuable and dangerous criminals to far-off locations \u2013 some islands are used for prisoners alone. \u201cPrison islands\u201d, we call them. Leave them there to rot away, stranded, where they can\u2019t hurt anyone. Better than any of those primitive human jails, in my opinion.\u201d She sits back in her chair. \u201cI\u2019m sure the prisoner didn\u2019t bother you at all. It would be a pretty big problem if that one managed to escape. A single mutant has the means to contact many others of its kind, and those creatures carry grudges against their captors for years. Downright murderous, they are. That's why it's essential that we keep every single one of them locked up.\u201d", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Ask her about the falling of the islands", "result": "The captain stares at you in amazement for a few moments. \u201cYou want to know why the islands are falling?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre you serious?

None of you Unworthy ones take the time to explore your surroundings. You\u2019re so satisfied with little things instead.\u201d\n\nStanding up from her desk, she strides over to the door of the room and beckons to you with a single talon. \u201cMother Ghared. Unworthy. Both of you, follow me. We\u2019re going up to the balcony so that I can educate this girl a little on the world around her.\u201d\n\nCurious about what she has in mind, you start to follow the captain out of the cabin. Mother Ghared is just a step behind you. \u201cWhy are we going up to the balcony?\u201d you ask. \u201cWhat's this got to do with the - \u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted to know why the islands are all falling, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she interrupts. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to tell you. it would take too much time to explain and I can\u2019t remember all the fancy words that you Unworthy ones use. No, I\u2019m going to show you instead.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow her up to the balcony", "result": "You follow the captain back onto the upper deck, onto a raised platform protected by a thick metal railing. Up here, you can see that a mystical crystalline device has been installed into the top of the airship. It seems to be made out of hundreds of tiny pieces of metal, interwoven together in a blend of silver and black. You cannot guess at its purpose, but the whole thing is humming with energy. Surely it must power the ship in some way.\n\n\u201cThe lens here will magnify any singular point on the surface, within a set range,\u201d the captain explains. Behind you, Mother Ghared scrambles up next to her. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s focused on one of the human-inhabited regions far below us. Think of it as a giant magnifying glass, except that this one takes about two hours to realign the location. Not very practical, in theory. Usually, we just use it to pinpoint any turbulent weather conditions coming our way, but we don\u2019t have a lot of contact with the people on the surface anyway.\u201d She stands back, allowing you to take your place in front of the device. \u201cStep up to the lens, Unworthy. Take a look for yourself at what\u2019s happening on the surface!\u201d\n\nWarily, you move forward as she requests and peer into the giant lens.\n\nThe first thing you notice is just how much detail the instrument is showing you. You can see houses down below. People. Trees. In fact, if you look in the right location, then you can see exactly what people are doing. To be honest, it makes you feel a little uncomfortable to be using a device that could technically be used to spy on people. You adjust the lens using the controls on the side, coming out of focus in order to try and look at something else in the same region.\n\nA black spot shows up on the lens.\n\nAs you focus in on the spot, you realise with alarm that you are looking at the ruins of a whole cluster of buildings. No, not just buildings. That\u2019s\u2026that's an entire town. Big enough to be a city, even. It\u2019s just a burned-out hole in the ground. More black spots appear on the lens now, hundreds and hundreds of them, like termites crawling through the earth...\n\nThat isn\u2019t all. Some of the black spots are surrounded by a sea of red. You move into sharper focus now, going a bit further up, and see that a red river is flowing from a\u2026a mountain? No. it can\u2019t be. That\u2019s a volcano. That means\u2026\n\nYour heart skips a beat as you swiftly scan the rest of the surrounding region, looking for any signs of life down there. There are still people there. They\u2019re alive, but they\u2019re not living. The earth has cracked all the way down the middle, right across the centre of the entire continent. It\u2019s a crack which extends far and wide, beyond what the lens can see at this position.\n\nThe patch of red is accompanied by orange\u2026and then blue. Are those flood waters? Just what is going on here? There\u2019s so much going on at the surface that you can\u2019t make head or tails about what you're really looking at, let alone grasp the bigger picture. Is it just a constant stream of natural disasters? All at once?\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for a specific, detailed explanation on what has happened,\u201d the captain says, \u201cthen you are all out of luck. Nobody can tell you what happened at the source. If you were close enough to know for sure, then you would already be dead. What you can see before you is what's going on right now.\u201d She gestures to the crack running down the middle. \u201cThat\u2019s not the result of a normal earthquake. Nor do we believe that a number of volcanoes erupted all at once, purely by accident. Mother Ghared has offered her views on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible that there was a split in the energy flow between the human nations,\u201d Mother Ghared ventures. \u201cEverything feeds off energy. Input and output; produce, waste and conservation. Energy is what keeps your islands suspended in the sky. It\u2019s what breathes new life into you. When there\u2019s too much of it in one place, and too little in another\u2026\u201d She shakes her head sadly. \u201cThe Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn call it a \u201ctemporal discharge\u201d, although that kind of phrase is largely inaccurate. It\u2019s a measure of great force which saps an enormous amount of resources from the planet itself. The planet, of course, reacts accordingly.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s my theory, but there are others. War could be the trigger. Mass deprivation of world resources. It was always going to happen one day. All we know is that there are no outside forces at work. Everything\u2019s that happened\u2026is something that we did nothing to avoid.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, the effects upon the sky islands have been disastrous. The tremendous energy drain has disrupted the gravitational pull to an extreme, causing many of the islands to fall out of the sky. Countless airships have been leeched of their power, stranding them in open sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d the captain growls. \u201cI make my own preparations. When our energy cells were depleted, I immediately had the helmsmen switch to our back-up source and keep us airborne. We should survive until we reach the next island. I don't care what those humans did on the surface, but they're not going to bring an Auvahr ship down.\u201d\n\nMother Ghared's words swim through your head, but you are still staring at the scenes before you in a state of utter shock. Is this what\u2019s happened to the world? Why? What could be worth this? But at the same time, you remember the experiences you had just days before the island started falling. Changes in the wind. Abstract extremes of temperature and air pressure. Unexplainable disturbances in the atmosphere which were thought to return to normal within the year.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what to make of this. You don\u2019t know what to make of any of this. How can you survive in a world like this, so chaotic and constantly at war with itself? Will you really be safe up here in the sky? The only plan you can think of is to find a new island to settle on, somewhere that you can start again. That would be nice. Wouldn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice?\n\nWhere do you go from here?", "action_results": [{"action": "Proceed", "result": "Abruptly, the captain switches off the lens completely.

Who are you, and where do you come from?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t see any reason to lie. \u201cWe do not name each other,\u201d you say truthfully.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d The captain frowns distastefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a name?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody is born with a name,\u201d you answer. \u201cAmong humans, the parents name a child at birth regardless of whether they ask for it or not. It is not customary to use names among my people. Giving yourself a name only makes it easier for someone to gain power over you.

Her island must be at the bottom of the sea by now. Very few survived the fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Maybe you\u2019d just like to say that when I tell my superiors that I took in an Unworthy on board my ship. Gender? Female. Name? Non-applicable. Place of birth? Some island that fell out of the sky.\u201d She stares at you angrily. \u201cListen, girl, you\u2019re not making it easy for me to fill out the required paperwork. I\u2019m not even going to ask how old you are, because you\u2019d probably tell me that you only count backwards using the constellations at a certain time of the year. Can I at least get an iota of cooperation from you, Unworthy?!\u201d\n\nAs she talks, your gaze is drawn to a strange sight upon the horizon.

It's rare for a lightning storm of this size to appear without any warning, but...\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this to do with what's happening on the surface?\u201d you ask worriedly. There was no sign of any such storm until now. The change in pressure was simply so drastic for this to happen naturally.\n\nThe look in the captain's eyes tells you the answer to that. \u201cUnworthy, you\u2019d better get yourself below deck where it\u2019s safer,\u201d she says grimly. \u201cJust stay out of trouble. That way I won\u2019t have to worry about protecting your neck.\u201d\n\nWith that she rushes down the steps, still shouting orders as the storm draws closer.

The water comes up to your waist.\n\n\n \n\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, O traveller of the skies,\n\nDrink from the water, and burn out your life;\n\nOur singing shall ease all your worries and fears,\n\nCome closer, young traveller, for all you hold dear\u2026\n\n\n \n\nThe voices fade away, and you are immediately struck by the impact of the silence all around you. Desiring to break the silence, you wade deeper into the lake\u2019s waters. You haven\u2019t heard the voice of another soul on this isle for nearly a month. As much as you hate to admit it, the loneliness is starting to get to you. It would be cruel to deprive you of such company.\n\nYou push further into the lake, not caring that your clothes are now drenched. From afar, you can hear the singing voices again. The water level comes up to your chest.\n\n\n \n\n\u201cRejoice, rejoice, O traveller of the skies,\n\nNo need for emotions, to laugh or to cry;\n\nSing with us here in the depths of the lake,\n\nNaught but your soul and your spirit shall we take\u2026\n\n\n \n\nA strange feeling passes over you, and the singing cuts out. The water level comes up to your neck, turning into a murky green.\n\nDespite yourself, you do not feel that you are in any real danger. A low hum echoes from all around you, almost seeming to resonate from the waters of the lake itself. You can no longer see the edge of the lake anymore. You swim forward impatiently, still searching for the source of the voices\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\nThe face of a young woman emerges from the water in front of you. She appears to be vaguely human-like in appearance, but when she speaks, it sounds as if you are hearing her voice from underwater. Green hair flows down her back, and you see scales dotting her cheeks. An aquatic lifeform of some kind, perhaps. You didn\u2019t know there were such people living in these waters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not one of us,\u201d she says, a surprised look on her face. \u201cWhy are you alive? How can you possibly survive here?\u201d\n\nHer questions baffle you. Before you can answer her, a second woman appears from the water, rising up to surface besides her companion.\n\n\u201cLook, sister,\u201d she whispers, pointing towards you. \u201cIt\u2019s not a male this time. The men usually drown themselves trying to hear the song, but she\u2026\u201d She smiles faintly at you, pulling back a lock of matted grey hair to one side. You see the hint of fangs protruding from inside her mouth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a female come here before. Maybe she could join us. Our song has more effect with greater numbers\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother sister?\u201d the green-haired woman sounds dubious. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never done that before. Is she\u2026safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not, but we can easily change her.\u201d The other woman looks at you curiously. \u201cTraveller of the skies, we are the inhabitants of this isle. Everything you see before you is our property and ours alone. Those who visit our land are drawn into the dark waters and consumed by our sisters and children, giving us new life. We share the energy among us and channel it into the land itself, replenishing it. We do not die. We do not perish. Settlers sometimes come here and seek to drain the resources from the island, but no man cannot resist our song. We take from them what they seek to take from us.\u201d\n\nShe holds out a slim hand towards you. \u201cWould you like to join us, traveller? Another female would be a welcome addition to our circle. If you become one of our sisters, you too will enjoy the privileges afforded to us all. However, I will not force you. Should you refuse, we will do you no harm, but please think very carefully before you answer.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Agree to join them", "result": "\u201cWonderful,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cThen let me welcome you in the tradition of our people. A kiss is necessary to seal the agreement of mutual acceptance.\u201d\n\nBefore you can do anything, the grey-haired woman moves swiftly through the water towards you and embraces you tightly. Her lips move onto yours in a surprisingly intimate fashion, and you can't quite keep the shock out of your eyes. You can feel your body changing as an effect of the kiss, as if your internal organs are slowly undergoing alterations of their own\u2026\n\nScales appear upon your face, and the tone of your skin deepens to a pale blue. Your vision begins to go fuzzy, and a small measure of panic starts to take root in your mind. What's going on? What exactly have you agreed to do here? Before you, the woman mouths a single word before disappearing into the waters of the lake. You feel her grip your ankles tightly from under the surface...and pull you underwater with her.\n\nYou struggle to break her grip, but in moments you are forced under the surface. With a start, you realise that you can actually breathe underwater. What has happened to you? You feel as if you have gills in place, rather than lungs, and that your body has altered to that of an aquatic being. Fins and scales grow down your body, and any prior hunger or fatigue has lessened as a result. You don't know what significance this has, but\u2026\n\nThe two women from before are swimming underwater with you and watching you closely. You see now that their bodies are just like yours, and that instead of legs they have a fish-like tail. Nothing of the sort has happened to you, however, so you are able to keep your legs for now.\n\n\u201cCome, sister,\u201d the green-haired woman says to you, much warmer to you now. She isn't a woman at all, you realise. A fish? A mermaid? \u201cCome and meet the others. Let us share this land together, all of us.\u201d\n\nYou swim after her, deeper and deeper through the pleasant waters of the lake. More and more of these mermaids appear from around you, watching you with interest and chatting amongst themselves. You didn't know that so many of these creatures were living down here. You thought the entire island was empty of any intelligent life...\n\nRight at the bottom of the lake, you discover a curious sight. A stone altar of some kind has been built into the lake bed, upon which a human body is tied. He seems to have been dead for some time. You watch as the mermaids surround him in a tight circle, singing in unison. It's almost as if they're singing to his corpse.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d your companion whispers to you, beckoning you forward. \u201cYou should join in too.\u201d\n\nCurious about this strange ritual, you stumble into the circle with her. The beautiful singing echoes all around you, and there is an addictiveness about the harmony of voices which is almost ethereal. You find yourself singing along, too, singing to the human corpse strapped upon the altar. It's mesmerising, hypnotic, and you soon lose yourself in the sound...\n\nYou don't know how long you've been singing for, but before long you start to feel a form of energy take place in your stomach. The feeling is not unpleasant. Euphoria washes over you as the energy grows and grows, giving rise to a greater volume of voices than before. Somehow, you and the other mermaids are leeching away the human's composition, converting it into something which will benefit everyone. The other mermaids are feeling it, too. You can see it in their faces. One of them smiles at you, understanding that you are with them, and you can't help but smile back.\n\nThe ceremony soon ends, and a new day starts anew. You spend all of your time with the community of mermaids around you, exploring the lake and occasionally going up to the surface when any new settlers think to land upon this island. Each time they do, you join in the singing with your sister mermaids, and watch as the men have no choice but to come deeper and deeper into the waters of the lake. They cannot resist the lure of your singing, and drown in the process.\n\nEvery week or so, you participate in another ceremony among one of the drowned men, devouring their body in order to give life back to the island. You feel that you are doing wonderful work here. The bodies of these humans can keep you living forever, really. This is a life that you can look back upon without feeling any regret.\n\nYou ultimately remain here with the other mermaids, here upon this seemingly deserted island, feeding upon any explorers foolish enough to try and settle here. The words of your sisters ring true. This is your land. You will not let anyone take it from you. This island belongs to you.\n\nYou live here in contentment, oblivious to the chaos going on in the surface.

The greatest wonders await you beneath the surface of this lake. I will withdraw my offer.\u201d\n\nWith that, she turns away from you and disappears into the water with a small splash. Her companion stares at you for a moment and also vanishes underwater with her. You wait there for a few minutes longer, but neither of the women re-emerge. It seems that they have gone for good.\n\nCurious about her words, you try swimming underwater yourself to see if you can find them again. Unfortunately, you find that the waters here are too murky to see much at all, aside from a few schools of fish swimming near the surface of the lake. The singing has stopped, and only dead silence greets you. You swim around for a while longer, but nothing else happens.\n\nFeeling as if you might have missed out on something, you decide that there is nothing else here for you and leave the waters of the lake behind you.

You work on cutting down trees to build a basic shelter, although the natural climate here means that sleeping rough isn\u2019t really a problem. Over time, you improve your skills and modify the shelter into a small cabin for all of your needs.\n\nYou never see anyone else land on this island, not even the Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn.

Not that you\u2019re going to become a crazy cat lady or something, but it\u2019s better than talking to yourself all the time. You start growing fruit and vegetables, using the resources of the island to your advantage.

Someone saw you using the flying ability \u2013 or sensed it, detected it, whatever \u2013 and decided that you\u2019d breached some kind of unspoken law of theirs.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d you protest. \u201cThe airship \u2013 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou were caught using a long-distance Flight scroll,\u201d the official says, his tone rather hostile. \u201cUnless you have a very good reason for doing so, Unworthy, you will face the penalty of breathing the laws of Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn. The island of Majeruk is under the jurisdiction of the Auvahrs of Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn, and all must abide by our rules. A lifetime upon a prison island will do a world of good for scum like you.\u201d\n\nSurely, if you were to explain yourself rationally to the man, then he should understand that this is all a big misunderstanding and let you go.

You continue talking about how you activated the scroll, gaining the ability of flight for a temporary basis, but the official abruptly holds up a hand to stop you.\n\n\u201cI have heard quite enough,\u201d he says sharply. \u201cYour story is an unlikely one to begin with. Whilst there have been reports that many islands have been falling due to the effects of the chaos on the surface, it is inconceivable that a high-ranking member of the Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn would choose to save your skin. You are an Unworthy. Your life is not of equal worth to a normal person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d you protest. \u201cMother Ghared saved my life!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d He folds his arms. \u201cAnd where is Mother Ghared now?

If Mother Ghared truly acted as you claim, then it means that the rules and regulations of the Gahl\u2019vuhr Sehn have not been followed correctly. I see no reason to trust your word. Rather, it seems far more likely that you were a stowaway on board.\u201d\n\nWith that, the official turns away and issues a sharp command to the men on either side of him.

Normal citizens are not permitted access to such privileges, let alone an Unworthy like you.

Two more men enter the front of the vehicle. The engines start to fire up.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you demand, fearful of what they intend to do with you.

Agony rushes through your body at every little movement, prompting a scream deep within your throat that nobody will hear. You grit your teeth and keep swimming upwards, your lungs burning. You need to survive.\n\nYou break the surface at last, hacking and coughing as you take in fresh oxygen into your lungs. Air. Fresh air. From here, you can see the coastline isn't too far away. You should be able to make it as long as you tread water and take it nice and slowly. You've survived this far and you're determined to keep going, despite the mind-numbing pain tearing through your limbs.\n\nIt takes several minutes for you to get to dry land, but you can already tell that something is very wrong. You do not feel well. Perhaps it's the effect of swallowing so much sea water, but you are unsteady on your feet and you can feel a surge of unnaturally dark emotions rising up inside you. You do not feel like yourself. Grimly, you force yourself to suppress such thoughts and concentrate on reaching safety.\n\nThe coastline is littered with corpses.\n\nYou stagger forward and see people shambling across the beach. They do not look like people. Humans, yes. You haven't seen a human being for a long time, but you know what a rational person look like and these are different. Their clothes are ripped and torn, their skin covered by a mesh of angry black spots which suggest the telltale designs of disease, and there is a frenzy in their eyes which frightens you beyond anything you have witnessed so far.\n\nThe people have not reacted to your presence. They are screaming at the top of their voices, wielding vicious blades in their hands, and killing each other on sight. Countless bodies cover the blackened ground as far as the eye can see, like the gruesome remnants of some kind of battlefield. It's as if a war is going on, but you can see here that the war is purely internal.\n\nYou see two men beating another to death with a hatchet. A crowd of children have surrounded a woman and are stabbing her repeatedly, all with the same murderous frenzy in their eyes. Three girls are gouging out the eyes of a bystander. A strange haze has settled upon this place, this peaceful village that saw no such violence before. Everything has gone out of control. You knew the situation on the surface was dire, but you had no idea that it had escalated to such extremes...\n\nSomething snaps inside of you. Something wild. It's the same feeling you had just minutes ago, not long after you accidentally swallowed some of that seawater. You turn to look at the ocean curiously for a moment, and can't help but notice that the water is...a different colour than it's supposed to be. It's certainly not blue...\n\nYou drop to the ground, retching, as a new pain takes hold of you. You can't see anymore. Blood fills your eyes and you buckle forward, clutching at the ground in a similar frenzy to the people around you. You hear yourself scream aloud as every thought going through your mind is crushed into nothing, nothing but a maniacal desire for bloodlust. The world feels like it's revolving around you all of a sudden, revolving in a sea of haunted faces\u2026\n\nThere is no need to think anymore. You snarl and shriek like a wild beast, pouncing forward onto the nearest human being to pluck out their eyes and beat their face into a bloody mess. The man is holding a knife of some kind, and you immediately wrest it from his cold dead hands to take for yourself.\n\nGleefully, you charge at your next choice of prey. Two girls covered with blood from head to toe shamble towards you, half-blind. One of them is practically dead already, but she hasn't realised it yet. Both of her arms have been savagely torn off, and her head has been bashed in from one side. You slash at her with the knife and blood spurts out of her throat in a red fountain. The other girl lunges at your neck. You stab her in the stomach. She doesn't react.\n\nA man is clubbing you from behind, but you don't feel a thing. More people are here now. More people, more violence, more chaos. You twist out of your assailant's grip and kill another person, doesn't matter who it is. You're having fun, and every part of you loves it.\n\nThis is your place now. You're part of the neverending chaos on the surface, just another victim of the shambling horde drifting across the planet in your insatiable desire to kill every living creature you see.

It would not do to frighten him.\n\nStill, you\u2019re just glad that he speaks your language, unlike the captain\u2019s entire crew on board the airship, who mouthed off in Common Tongue to no end.\n\n\u201cI mean you no harm,\u201d you say to him.

That confuses you at first, until you recall that purple refers to sexual attraction. His eyes are still fixed on you. Well, this is just brilliant. Your first time on another island and the first native boy you meet is attracted to you.\n\n\u201cWe have heard about the falling of the other islands,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYou have my sympathy.

You hear murmuring amongst them, and more than a few glares directed towards the emblem of the Gahl'Vuhr Sehn, in full view for everyone to see. People are beginning to whisper to one another, calling for you to be thrown out from the island altogether.

Too long. I want you to get me out of here. That vehicle of yours can support another passenger, so long as you don't go too fast.\u201d\n\nHe takes another step towards you, eyes burning into yours. \u201cI don't weigh much. Not anymore.

Smoke billows out from the front of your vehicle, and you see that the exterior has been completely ripped apart. At the same time, it has cushioned the blow for you.\n\nYou are alive. You can hardly acknowledge the fact, but you are alive. Sparks fly from the dashboard, igniting another smaller fire within the interior, and you force yourself to get to your feet.

Humans, yes. You haven't seen a human being for a long time, but you know what a rational person look like and these are different from that.

They are screaming at the top of their voices, wielding vicious blades in their hands, and killing each other on sight. Countless corpses litter the blackened ground as far as the eye can see, like the gruesome remnants of some kind of battlefield. It's as if a war is going on, but you can see here that the war is purely internal.\n\nYou see two men beating another to death with a hatchet. A crowd of children have surrounded a woman and are stabbing her repeatedly, all with the same murderous frenzy in their eyes. Three girls are gouging out the eyes of a bystander. A strange haze has settled upon this place, this peaceful village that saw no such violence before. Everything has gone out of control. You knew the situation on the surface was dire, but you had no idea that it had escalated to such extremes...\n\nDesperately, you run for the safety of your aerial vehicle, even though there is no chance of getting it off the ground anymore. You can't take this. This is not an atmosphere in which you can survive.

No semblance of reason remains in their minds. Not anymore.\n\nThe last thing you see is the irrational hatred and rage burning in their eyes, before your body is hacked to pieces by the inhabitants of the surface.

Money is no problem here; rather, Tenurs value work and resources to trade rather than currency, and you work to secure a steady job for yourself. The island is in need of miners, couriers and helpers for building work and you soon find an available position.\n\nAfter that, the rest of the week passes quite quickly. You become close friends with the Tenur man and become acquainted with many people in his circle, as well as other Tenurs at your place of employment. A settlement has been reached. Before the end of the week, you even procure a name for yourself so as to fit into Tenurian society. Annabel. That's what you call yourself now. Annabel. It has a nice ring to it, and you refuse to answer to anything but that. Nobody can call you Unworthy anymore.\n\nAn entire month passes, and you find that you are enjoying month here with the Tenurs. The vehicle you used to travel here is found smashed up just a week after that, turned into scrap metal. Apparently, the locals here really don't like the Gahl'Vuhr Sehn. It's a good thing you didn't associate yourself with the organisation, because the people here seem so friendly otherwise.\n\nMonths turn into years, and you soon forget about the chaos happening on the surface far below. There's nothing to fear here. There is frequent news about the other islands which have fallen, but the Tenurs are a proud people and often talk about how the humans have destroyed themselves. It's nothing for you to be concerned about, really, so long as that kind of destruction doesn't affect your daily life.\n\nYou amass enough resources to improve your place of residence, and even start moving in with a few Tenur males who are interested in you. In fact, you become quite popular upon this island. You spend your resources wisely and save when you can. You have much to look forward to. You start to think about the future, about marriage and children and what prospects you have for them upon this island. The future is bright. This island is not going to fall, after all.
