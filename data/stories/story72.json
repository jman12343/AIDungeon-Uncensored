Powell and his mother Olivia Powell, aged 40, were volunteers for the National Group and both lived and worked on the Island. Powell, who took the ferry to and from the mainland to attend and leave Poole Grammar School every morning and evening was described by one classmate as a \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d student.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Dorset Police Force it was confirmed that \u201cA teenager died during a fall from a clifftop on Blacksea Island sometime between the hours of 10pm and 6am last night. At this time no foul play is suspected as the part of the island on which the deceased and his mother were living, known locally as \u201cThe Wetlands\u201d, is enclosed by a high spike-topped wall and barred gates, making entry by a third party extremely unlikely.\n\nThis paper was able to speak with Barry Guest, owner and operator of the Blacksea Ferry. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told us in a statement. \u201cRobert was a happy boy and just about the last person I would have expected to top himself. I reckon it was an accident, a fall from the cliffs though Robert would have known better than to go up there at night. I feel sorry for his poor mum, she\u2019s been left all on her own now.\u201d\n\nRobert Powell\u2019s suicide is the third such to happen on the island within living memory: on 25 December 1920 island owner Colonel Augustus Foster shot himself in the Hall of Blacksea Castle and on 5 July 1960 Castle Housekeeper Gwen Green apparently drowned herself in a Lily Pond on the island following a devastating fire on 30 June that had claimed the lives of her husband, butler Jack Green, and the island\u2019s owner, Lord Marcus Van Raalte.\n\nBlacksea Island has a history of death and madness and indeed the eccentricity of a number of the island\u2019s owners, most notoriously \u201cThe Mad Doctor\u201d William Benson and the much-reviled Lady Mary Bonham-Christie, who closed the island to the public during her ownership of the island from 1960 to 1980, has done much to bear these suspicions out.
