All flash and nothing to back it up. (Though you don\u2019t mind looking at the young females that are there) That\u2019s why they hang out in packs. You never did that even when you were young.

I\u2019m also glad to see you\u2019re still as anti-social as usual Wolf.\u201d Mary says as you finally get off of your misguided heckler and approach her.

So primal. Maybe later I can dress in a little red cloak and we can reenact a fairy tale.\u201d\n\u201cSome fairy tale, as I remember you loved a lot of beings.\u201d\n\u201cHey I can\u2019t help who I am. I was created this way.\u201d\n\u201cJust like Frankie eh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you compare me to that sicko! Yes we are controlled by our genetics to a certain degree, but as you damn well know I rose above them! I made my own identity. I\u2019m a successful director and writer now, so what if I have a healthy sexual appetite? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree given all the beings you had your way with before, after and DURING your marriage!\u201d\n\u201cLook never mind all that.

It makes a mockery of werewolves! You even named one of them fucking Benji!\u201d\n\u201cWell comedy is popular now.

You hate to coin a pun, but she literally is one hot l\u2019il bitch.\n\n\u201cErm, not you. You stay in your human form; I kind of like the whole teenage slut look you got going on.

It seems Victor has been keeping himself very busy in recent years.\n\nAs it begins to rain, a familiar voice calls to you from one of the towers.\n\n\u201cIts you. Vic always knew you\u2019d return one day. I never believed him though. I guess I owe him fifty bucks.\u201d\n\nYou look up and see Igor, he looks different too. He has a lot of clumsy cybernetic implants, one of them being some sort of gun in place of an arm. More of Vic\u2019s \u201chandy work\u201d no doubt. He\u2019s still got that damn hump on his back though.\n\n\u201cIgor? You still alive? I thought your ungrateful master would\u2019ve just let you die of old age and get himself another assistant.

Mary\u2019s little movie is made purely for exploitation, but its GOOD exploitation. It\u2019ll show everyone who we are and that we\u2019re NOT to be fucked with! This isn\u2019t some shitty family movie. This is raw footage of werewolves doing what they do best, kicking ass! We couldn\u2019t ask for better publicity.

As you jump down into the courtyard you half expect yourself to be overwhelmed by vampires, or even ghouls, but nothing happens. This is weird, there aren\u2019t even any guards patrolling or even at the door. In fact it sounds like a party is going on inside. You hear lots of laughter and music. Suddenly someone comes outside and sees you. It\u2019s some Vampire chick.\n\n\u201cOhhh, a Werewolf! Wow, I didn\u2019t know any of you types were invited to the party; I thought Drac hated you guys. Well what\u2019re you doing standing outside? Come on in the party\u2019s just starting!\u201d she says waving you in.\n\nA bit of a different approach than you were preparing for, but you enter. You entrance to the ballroom is immediately a big event. You\u2019re the only Werewolf there. Everyone else is either a Vampire, a ghoul, or even a human \u201cservant\u201d. Everyone is staring at you, some with wonder and interest, most with hatred, a few in awe. Most probably haven\u2019t encountered a Werewolf like you before. The staring would probably continue if another slightly out of place being didn\u2019t come shuffling up to you to talk you in a friendly manner causing the bloodsuckers to go back to partying. It\u2019s Im-Ho-Tep. You\u2019re surprised to see him here.\n\n\u201cWolf?! YOU got an invitation to this thing? I can\u2019t believe it! What the hell did you and Dracula kiss and make up?\u201d he remarks with his scratchy sounding voice.\n\u201cNot in this life time Teppy. What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\n\u201dMe? Oh you know Vlad, he\u2019s always gotta put on a show. Likes to play up the whole royalty thing to the other bloodsuckers, so he always invites me to these things to prove he\u2019s got connections or something since I was a Prince. I always keep telling him, it\u2019s a meaningless title since the Egyptian Empire fell thousands of years ago, but he insists on flying me out here, making a big fuss and everything so what the hell, it\u2019s not like I got anything better to do plus I get a kick out of watching the bloodsuckers get drunk and make idiots out of themselves, well that and I like to look at some of these Vamp chicks. Heh, guess that makes me a voyeur, but again what the hell, its one of the few pleasures I get in this world anymore. But enough about this dirty old man, what brings you here if you weren\u2019t invited?

All I can say is\u2026 what took you so long? I thought this day would come long before now. Lost some bets because of it, oh well easy come easy go. Well you know your secret\u2019s safe with me, though I suppose it won\u2019t be a secret for too much longer! You\u2019re still the craziest sonofabitch I know, but then you always did know how to liven up a party! Ha ha! Ol\u2019 Vlad will probably be making his grand entrance soon, so just wait awhile. He threw this party for some kind of special announcement he has to make. I still got a bet with Erik that you would win if you and Drac ever got into a battle to the death.

It isn\u2019t enough to knock you out, but you fall off of Renfield and roll over feeling very woozy. In your bleary vision you can make out the form of that cocksucker Dracula standing over you. Another figure stands there as well, you don\u2019t know who they are, but they look somewhat familiar.\n\n\u201cWolf, I don\u2019t believe I invited you to this party, but it was good of you to come anyway. It only makes festivities more enjoyable! I think you\u2019ll give Jacob a good chance of testing himself.

You see the figure that kicked you in the face on the other side, it is Van Helsing\u2026or someone that looks like him since his name was Abraham, not Jacob. You find out soon enough, when he begins to speak.\n\n\u201cWolf, you\u2019re up. Good. I\u2019m anxious to test my new skills on you. Renfield certainly wouldn\u2019t have been much of a challenge, but you should prove to be. Even my foolish grandfather couldn\u2019t kill you. He couldn\u2019t kill Dracula either, but then Dracula was always superior in everyway. I have no idea why he pursued such an idiotic quest of trying to kill Vampires, they really are the supreme life form on this planet and certainly the most lovely and sensual. Vladimir has shown me such pleasures since our time together.\u201d\nYou shake your head and snicker. This must\u2019ve been the \u201cother\u201d defeated enemy that Renfield was on about.\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s how it is now? The Van Helsing bloodline finally defeated not through violence, but through seduction? Never thought I\u2019d see the day come. I had my problems with your family and especially your father, but I could at least respect their dedication. You\u2019re a fucking disgrace kid.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m merely ensuring the survival of my family name. What was I supposed to do, carrying on some pointless family tradition of monster hunting, and get myself killed? Fuck that. I want to live forever.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?

The top of it has a ton of garlic hanging from it. Sitting and looking utterly defeated is an ugly distorted looking humanoid, who is yet another face you\u2019re amazed to see. This revenge trip has just been one surprise after another.\n\n\u201cOrlock? Heard you were dead.\u201d you say.\n\u201cI wish I was, unfortunately Dracula insists on keeping me alive\u2026feeding me rats\u2026tormenting me\u2026reminding me of my shameful defeat by his hands\u2026I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re happy that he\u2019s torturing you? Sheesh, all you Undead are fucking masochists.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy that he\u2019s torturing me you ignorant dog, I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s proven to be so ruthless, despite his foppish ways. I must admit I had my doubts about him when I first created him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I see that really worked out well for you.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) True. But it\u2019s my own fault for having a soft spot for him I suppose. I should\u2019ve been more watchful of him. You\u2019ll be lucky, he\u2019ll just kill you, or rather have his new conquest Jacob do it.\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s killing me, I\u2019m getting the fuck outta here right now. These bars aren\u2019t going to hold me.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t that be difficult Wolf? Seeing that the bars are made of silver?\u201d\n\u201cSo fucking what? Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t touch them! As long as the things aren\u2019t going into my body they don\u2019t mean shit! Thought you bloodsuckers knew that. See that\u2019s the problem with you Vampires, always underestimating your enemies and being melodramatic. If Fagula and his bitch boys were smart they would\u2019ve killed me when they had the chance. That\u2019s what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cYou and I actually have more in common than you think. We both are the last of the old ways. I must admit that I too would\u2019ve killed you immediately, rather than toy with such a dangerous enemy.\u201d\n\nYou ignore Orlock and concentrate on the bars. You easily pry the silver bars open and step out of the cage; you then rip one of the bars out to take with you. Orlock looks at you with interest.\n\n\u201cWhy are you taking that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause unlike you Vampires, we Werewolves try to learn everything we can about our enemies. I know for a fact that silver hurts you fuckers too, though you guys like to try to keep that shit quiet.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Tis a shame we never clashed Wolf, you would\u2019ve been a worthy opponent.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well when I kill Drac, I can come back to finish you off too.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! Glad to see you have such confidence. However, if in the unlikely event that you do defeat Vlad, by all means come back and finish me off to put me out my misery. I would gladly welcome everlasting death at this point.\u201d\n\nYou leave the room and find yourself in a corridor made of dull stone; you\u2019re guessing you\u2019re probably underground. Nobody\u2019s around, but you can still hear the noise of the party above. You\u2019re about to head back up when you hear a voice close by.\n\n\u201cPsst! Wolf! Over here! Quick!\u201d\n\nYou turn around and at one end of the corridor you see Mary. Now what the fuck is SHE doing here?! You rush over to Mary.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTrying to prevent you from getting yourself killed, you stubborn macho asshole! When the Wolflings returned to the studio, I asked them where you went, and they told me, so I went after you. What the hell did you think you were doing coming here to kill Dracula?\u201d\n\u201cJust that! Kill his bloodsucking ass! How\u2019d you sneak in here anyway?\u201d\n\u201dI didn\u2019t, I got an invitation about a month ago to the party, so when I arrived I was expected. Then I heard you were taken down here by some of the guests.\u201d\n\u201cOh I can see you and Drac are still chummy with each other, figures, all you Undead stick together. You\u2019re probably here to help him not me!\u201d\n\u201dGoddammit Wolf, will you stop being so fucking paranoid! I wasn\u2019t even going to this thing; the only reason why I\u2019m here is because of you! Because maybe you don\u2019t want to believe it, but I do love you, you\u2019ve always only been the one to make me feel complete. After all the searching and traveling and trying to discover myself, it was our time together that I always held dear to me and stayed in my mind. Please, Wolf don\u2019t go through with this, we lost a lot of years already; now that we\u2019ve been reunited I don\u2019t want to lose you permanently. This is isn\u2019t worth it. You don\u2019t have to prove anything. I\u2019m familiar with the secret passages in this place, we could leave right now without any trouble.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s face does show expression of concern, and her voice does display worry. She may or may not be telling the truth. If she isn\u2019t then she\u2019s done a good job of fooling you.

Your pride in the past is what got you into a lot of trouble, and most of it was unnecessary. With age comes wisdom, and maybe its time you started to act your age. Your past accomplishments have spoken for themselves; you don\u2019t need to prove you still have \u201cone last fight\u201d in you.

Eventually you move in with Mary and live out the rest of your life with her.\n\nYou always expect Dracula to attempt to get you somehow for escaping, but he never does. In fact that whole event is never even brought up or made public, since you were also expecting slanderous attacks about how you ran away to show up in magazines or something. Maybe it was because he was too busy having trouble with his new lover Jacob attempting to get palimony, or maybe he didn\u2019t think the feud was that important either.\n\nYou still always will wonder what might\u2019ve happened\u2026", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Kill Dracula", "result": "You stare deeply into Mary\u2019s eyes, grab her and kiss her long and passionately.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going anyway aren\u2019t you?\u201d she says.\n\u201cI have to.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?!

Actually you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019re getting out of this alive, but this is something that you have to do, win or lose. You leave Mary to head back upstairs, while she goes off through one of those passages she was talking about.\n\nAs you\u2019re heading up the twisting staircase, you run into Renfield, who was coming down to get you no doubt. His eyes widen in shock and he turns to run.\n\n\u201cMAST\u2026\u201d he begins to shout and you smash the back of his skull with one of the silver bars. You then turn him over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s correct way of killing you Ghouls so I\u2019m not going to take any chances.\u201d You say placing your hands around his head and giving his neck a quick snap.

It takes some doing, but eventually you fish out the long slimy body part.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about where this has been.\u201d You say and throw it away.\n\nAs Renfield helplessly hisses at you, you plunge one of the silver bars through his chest. He begins to melt, he\u2019d probably shriek if he could. When he quickly becomes nothing but bloody bones, you remove the skull and throw it into the wall where it shatters and take back your silver bar.\n\nRenfield won\u2019t be coming back.\n\nYou finally reach the ground floor again and follow the sounds of the party. The guests have already heard about what you did earlier, and when you run into a few of them in the hallway they give you some problems. Fortunately they\u2019re a lot of flash and no substance. Three vampire guests attack and you quickly use your silver bar to smack them around. After knocking them all to the ground, you disable one by breaking his neck, while you\u2019re doing that, one of them attacks you from behind where upon you grab and flip him into a small table which splinters into pieces. He tries to get back up, but you kick him in the face, grab one of the table legs and shove it into his chest.\n\nYour last would be attacker seeing what you\u2019ve done runs off. You shake your head.\n\n\u201cSheesh, what happened to the days when you bloodsuckers actually put up a good fight?\u201d you say and shove another table leg into the chest of the vampire whose neck you just broke.\n\nYour little rumble in the hallway has most definitely been heard, but the rest of your journey to the ballroom continues with no other interruptions. Upon your arrival, the rest of the guests just watch you. Dracula lounges on a fancy couch on the far side of the room while his followers to grovel over him, Jacob being the most fawning.\n\n\u201cSo is Jacob going to be the next Renfield?\u201d you shout which gets you his attention and a very hostile look from Jacob.\n\u201cAh Wolf, you\u2019ve arrived. Where is Renfield anyway, I sent him to fetch you. I do hope you didn\u2019t hurt him too badly.\u201d Dracula, says without even looking at you.\n\u201cI regret to inform you that your favorite jizz jar is no longer among the living or the undead. He\u2019s just plain dead.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Ah well, it was bound to happen eventually, but still I will miss his\u2026enthusiasm. But this is no time to morn past losses, tonight is a time of celebration! Jacob, a member of the Van Helsing family. The mortal enemies of vampires everywhere, and the source of the notorious Abraham Van Helsing, who nearly ended my life. A family of murderers, yet Jacob has abandoned his homicidal family tradition and become one of us, proving that even the most implacable of foes can one day become friends\u2026and more.\u201d Dracula says giving Jacob a lecherous stare, but then finally looks over in your direction and his demeanor changes to that of anger as he points at you the whole time.\n\u201cBut some foes always remain. These types are the OLD, the JEALOUS, the BITTER, and the HATEFUL that are so miserable with their own pathetic existence that they feel they must ruin other people\u2019s happiness to make themselves feel better. This\u2026this ANIMAL that stands before us is attempting to do just that! He is the pinnacle example of everything that\u2019s wrong with his kind! The animals have always been jealous of us, and that will never change. Every now and then when a dog runs wild, it becomes necessary to slap it down and put it back in its place, but there are other times when it becomes rabid and needs to be destroyed. And that\u2019s what you are Wolf and rabid dog that\u2019s too stupid to know when to bow before your masters. Jacob, prove your love for me, destroy this animal.\u201d\n\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Jacob says to Dracula and steps towards you baring his fangs.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fight offensively", "result": "You charge at Jacob with your silver bar, but you miss and he swiftly grabs it from you.

You cough up blood as Jacob stands over you.\n\n\u201cMaybe my father failed to kill you, but I won\u2019t.

With a burst of speed, he leaps next to you and punches you three times in the face, the fourth time however his hand goes into your open mouth. You sink your fangs in, grab his arm and pull back with your head as hard as possible, biting it off at the forearm. Jacob reels back in shock as he stares in horror at his spurting bloody stump.

The crowd looks on in captivated awe.\n\n\u201cWell looks like I get to kill two Van Helsings, that\u2019s already one more than Fagula over there. Though I have to say, your father put up a better fight and he was only human. You sure you weren\u2019t adopted? You put up a poor showing boy, even for an overgrown leech.\u201d\n\u201cYou dare call me a leech you fucking animal?! You haven\u2019t won, look at what I found here!\u201d Jacob reaches into vest pocket with his one good arm and pulls out a pistol. You already know what it\u2019s loaded with.\n\nHe fires haphazardly at you, while you roll out of the way. Luckily he\u2019s as bad of a shot as his father was. Guests start running out of the way after a few silver bullets start hitting them. He doesn\u2019t care, who he hits, he\u2019s too busy trying to make sure one of the bullets hits you.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fail where my father did, I will kill you! I WILL KILL HIM!\u201d he screams. Of course in the chaos of everyone running around he doesn\u2019t seem to realize you\u2019ve appeared behind him.\n\n\u201cWrong again junior.\u201d You say, turning him around and shoving the silver bar cruelly through his chest, hearing that satisfying crack of his upper ribs and the squishy sound of the bar hitting his heart.\n\nHe falls to the ground dropping his pistol and clutching the bar which you dig in deeper as he starts to melt.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to hell, say hello to your dad for me\u2026and I sincerely hope he and the rest of the dead Van Helsing clan kicks your pansy ass for all eternity you fucking traitor.\u201d\n\nAs he releases one last death screech, you rip his head off and throw it at Dracula who hasn\u2019t left his couch. He just looks at the melted skull and shrugs while you take your silver bar and prepare for the final battle.\n\n\u201cWell I see your skills haven\u2019t deteriorated, but there has been a great deal of luck involved here tonight as well. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll find that your luck has run out. Do you actually think I\u2019m going to dirty my hands on an animal such as you? Please. It wouldn\u2019t be a contest anyway. My guests, I now give you the honor of fighting for me! That fool Van Helsing obviously wasn\u2019t worthy of my love, but for any of you that lands the killing blow on this mangy dog, you shall know the pleasures that only I can show you.\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta be fuckin\u2019 kidding me Vlad! That\u2019s supposed to be an honor? You\u2019re just trying to get out of this shit because you\u2019re fucking scared.\u201d Im-Ho-Tep pipes up from the back ground.\n\u201cStay outta this Tep!\u201d Dracula exclaims.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not in this little feud, but I\u2019m calling it like I see it. You\u2019re not willing to fight an old and tired Werewolf who\u2019s supposed to be inferior to you anyway? Now you do whatever, but if you\u2019re seriously going to let your followers do your dirty work, then you really are a big pussy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence as Dracula looks at Tep and then back over at you.

Just then it looks like Drac was wrong, your luck hasn\u2019t run out yet. Werewolves crash through the windows, and attack! They look like the ones from the studio! Then Mary comes rushing into the room smashing a Ghoul in the head, and stands fighting by your side while you fight off an attacking vampire.\n\n\u201cMary! What\u2019re you still doing here?! And how\u2019d you get them to help?\u201d you shout, twisting the vampire\u2019s head completely around.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I came here by myself did you? I figured you\u2019d insist on killing Drac. So I had the Wolflings come with me and told them to stay back until the appointed time.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?! I tried to get them to come and they didn\u2019t listen to me! And I\u2019m a fucking Werewolf!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m a people person, while you\u2019re mean old bastard, so of course they\u2019d be more willing to listen to me.

You\u2019d actually like them, had they not hunted Werewolves as well.\n\nThe Van Helsing family had a long standing tradition of hunting Vampires, they eventually stretched out to hunt other monsters as well, but Vampires were always their main target. They first got their start sometime during the medieval ages and each generation just continued the tradition.\n\nOddly just as monsters had to adapt to the changing times, so did the Van Helsings. No longer could they just barge into a house and kill someone because they were a Vampire, indeed most of the people who were bitten by Vampires claimed it was consensual and there for the Van Helsings had no right to intrude on what two beings did in private. Subterfuge abounded as Vampires in high political offices or positions of power manipulated laws to encourage more \u201cliberal\u201d policies. This still did not deter the Van Helsing family, but it did cause disillusionment and less of them enthusiastically took up the tradition of monster hunting.\n\nAbraham Van Helsing is probably the best known one for his continual hunt and battles with Dracula. Despite his best efforts he could never defeat him and ultimately lost all his friends and his life in the finally confrontation. (Yes, the movies like to give the \u201chappy ending\u201d to the tale, but reality is always much darker) His son Ishmael Van Helsing took up the mantle next, but fearing to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps he didn\u2019t pursue Dracula. Instead he hunted less powerful Vampires and other monsters, including you. There were a couple times he attempted to assassinate you, but the last time he tried, you managed to catch him and rip him limb from limb.\n\nJacob would be the next one to take up the mantel, but he showed little interest in it, and that would seem to be the end of Van Helsing tradition.", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Memories (Orlock)", "result": "Nosferatu: Count Orlock\n\nThe bloodsuckers are big on keeping secrets. Nowadays, all Vampires have a \u201ccool\u201d look about them which fits in with their youthful image. Even the ones that are \u201cold\u201d are still regal and respectable looking. Its part of the whole \u201cLet\u2019s get stupid humans to serve us and be like us\u201d routine that they like to employ. You keep telling the masses something long enough and they believe it and the past becomes forgotten.\n\nHowever even a secret slips out every now and then in movies and the hideous Nosferatu appear, but this is usually quickly dismissed as \u201ccreative license\u201d and not based on any kind of fact. Vampires deliberately attempt to destroy any evidence of their ugly pasts. One old movie was actually supposed to be based on Count Orlock, but this movie was quickly ordered to be destroyed through Vampire string pulling.\n\nThe truth is Vampires weren\u2019t always the \u201ccool\u201d MTV movie bullshit propaganda that that\u2019s churned out now. In the past there were the Elders or the first Vampires who looked as repugnant as any rotting corpse, they are also known as the Nosferatu. You rarely had any encounters with them as most of them were dead by then, but you heard many stories from your grandfather about them. They hid in the shadows, striking from the darkness, and returning to isolation, they used no servants. They did not mix and carry on a charade of \u201chumanity\u201d. They were true monsters.\n\nOver time however, things change and so did Vampires, there became an \u201cevolution\u201d of sorts (Though you\u2019re loathed to use a word for such unnatural creatures). In time it became necessary for trickery, to fit in, to blend with humans to prevent mass extinction from vampire hunters. Later generations started to retain their human looks, and the Nosferatu began to die off through various means. Most of them by the hands of their own younger kind. The younger generation saw the Nosferatu as a threat to their own survival, not to mention cramping their style. How were they supposed to get humans to willingly serve them, if these ugly Nosferatu were going around snatching children in the night? No, their time had come and gone, a new era must be ushered in. Eventually the Nostferatu were all hunted down and killed save one.\n\nCount Orlock was the last of the Nosferatu, he was by no means an Elder, but he was still old enough to not retain his humanity. Sensing his time was coming to a close, decided to create a servant to protect him. He sensed Vlad would be able to do this. The instant he made him into a Vampire, he attempted to instill loyalty into him and it worked\u2026for awhile at least. Eventually Dracula realized that Orlock was more of a burden than a teacher, and he turned on him.

As a royal Prince he didn\u2019t have as much freedom as he would\u2019ve liked, he basically had to stay in his palace and carry the responsibilities of an Empire which wasn\u2019t as much fun as one might think. He used to read a lot about all the places his advisors and soldiers all traveled to, but he couldn\u2019t ever go. So he decided that he would extend his life through magic so he could do and see all the things he couldn\u2019t while he was alive. When he died at the ripe old age of 33 (Humans didn\u2019t annoying live as long back then like they do now) the spell took effect and he snuck out of his sarcophagus at night.

His willingness to completely debase himself in everyway imaginable for Drac, is probably one of the reasons why Drac kept him around.

You ended up running off with that half a fag Dracula while I was getting all my shit taken away from me by my bitch ex-wife and sued by your goddamn no talent father!\u201d you say and move your hand away.\n\u201cIt was a confusing time for me Wolf! You know how I was, I had all these hormones injected into me and I was initially created for the sole purpose of being a sex toy! Yes, I managed to overcome, but I couldn\u2019t fight all of my initial feelings, I was also so curious about everything and anything! Dracula was a well traveled person and yes he WAS charming, I learned a lot while I was with him. I saw the world and more. You think I wanted to leave you? I loved you! Yes and I know you find that hard to believe that something Undead is capable of love, but I LOVED you!\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, well if you loved me so fucking much, why the fuck did you leave?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I had to! You were stuck in your own little world, never wanting to mix with anyone, never wanting to do anything that didn\u2019t interest you, I\u2019m a social being! I need to be around people. I don\u2019t know, maybe its because I was originally made to just stay locked in that fucking castle for that sicko Frankie and I spent so much time alone that I never wanted to be alone again. If stayed with you EVEN after your divorce and mine, I would\u2019ve been trading a neglective mate, for an overly possessive one. Come on Wolf I know you. You would\u2019ve been alienating everyone who looked at me with a hint of attraction. I had to let you go so I could be independent and find myself.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re the fucking victim as always right Mary? Tell someone who gives a shit. Fuck this, I\u2019m not working on this movie with you, I don\u2019t care what rewrites you do. I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nYou storm off, but as always Mary gets the last word.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be a victim, because you\u2019ve already taken that job! You carry a chip on your shoulder the size of Gibraltar and act like the goddamn World owes you something, well it doesn\u2019t! You can\u2019t let shit go! It\u2019s why you\u2019re all by yourself! Okay Wolf, fuck me then, I was no good fucking cheating bitch that did you wrong. Fine. You talk to any of your children lately? At least the ones you know about? You got fucking sons and daughters Wolf and you\u2019ve alienated ALL of them with your inflexibility and assholiness! Even Lawrence, who you once were so proud of remember? He was following in your footsteps remember? But what happened? He disappointed you by following his heart instead of YOUR bigotry!\u201d\n\nThe name \u201cLawrence\u201d is one you haven\u2019t heard in a long time and one you hoped you\u2019d never hear again. You have to stop yourself from seriously damaging Mary for even mentioning him. Instead you just slowly turn around and attempt to calm yourself.\n\n\u201cMary, you will NOT fucking utter that name again. He\u2019s fucking dead to me. You got that? He\u2019s as fucking dead as your fucking flesh! He\u2019s not a son, he\u2019s not a relative, he\u2019s not a friend!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I knew you\u2019d say something like that, I told LAWRENCE that when we talked the last time and it\u2019s so sad because he\u2019s always just wanted your approval.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell? What is Mary doing talking to your fucking no good disappointment of a son who dishonored the family by marrying Irena\u2026one of the Cat People.", "action_results": [{"action": "Question Mary", "result": "Your interest is overriding your loathing; you decide to question Mary further.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing talking to Lawrence?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s a complete stranger to me you know, we did meet several times on the set when you and I were seeing each other. We got along remember?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I remember, so what, were you fucking him too at the time?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) No Wolf, though I wouldn\u2019t have minded that since he was less of an asshole and a more open minded sort than you! In fact had he not been so in love with Irena, I might\u2019ve tried, but I saw theirs was a true love and I wasn\u2019t going to break that up\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHold just a goddamn minute! He told YOU about Irena before me?! You were keeping secrets from me?!\u201d\n\u201cNo! In fact I was the one who told him to tell you about Irena because I knew you\u2019d find out eventually, though he should\u2019ve picked a better time than in the middle of your divorce to do it. I didn\u2019t tell you because it wasn\u2019t my place and it was between you and him. He wanted to keep it secret since he was so afraid that you\u2019d be disappointed in him\u2026\u201d\n\u201dHah! Disappointment isn\u2019t a strong enough word!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess that was a mistake on my part. I figured you\u2019d be able to look past it and I told him you would because he was your son and you were so proud of him\u2026huh. I see your mind hasn\u2019t changed on the subject though.\u201d\n\u201cNever will either, now that was fucking years ago what the hell are you doing still talking to him?\u201d\n\u201cWolf, just because I wasn\u2019t with you, doesn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t talk to Lawrence! Maybe by staying in contact with him, I felt like I was still in contact with you. Goddammit Wolf, I\u2019m a free woman, I can talk to who I want! Besides, you disowned him anyway, what do you care?! I always kept in contact with Lawrence AND Irena. I even see them both every now and then\u2026I bet I know more about Lawrence now than you do\u2026hell I bet you don\u2019t even know they have children! You got MORE grandchildren you don\u2019t even know about!\u201d\n\nYou stand in utter shock; you didn\u2019t even know such a pairing would produce off spring. You didn\u2019t really want to think about it really.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got children?\u201d you say dumbfounded.\n\u201cYeah a few of them, they\u2019re a bit funny looking, but they\u2019re very cute! (Sigh) I always wished I was able to have children\u2026\u201d Mary says wistfully. \u201cYou know Wolf you really should see Lawrence. It would mean so much to him.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know, maybe all this information has bewildered you a bit, maybe Mary laid down the lovin\u2019 really good, maybe you\u2019re getting soft in your old age or maybe, just MAYBE you do want to see Lawrence.\n\n\u201c\u2026Alright\u2026alright Mary, I\u2019ll go see him, but I\u2019m not promising anything!\u201d\n\nMary smiles and hugs you.\n\n\u201cYou will?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but if his cat bitch starts anything, I\u2019m outta there!\u201d\n\u201cOh Irena\u2019s nice! You should get to know her too! She isn\u2019t at all like you think Cat People are! I\u2019ll go get ready!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re coming too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, someone\u2019s gotta keep you on a leash so you don\u2019t end up destroying something, besides I know where they live and you don\u2019t, so I\u2019m going with you.\u201d\n\nSoon you and Mary get on your Harley and are on your way. Mary tells you how to get your son\u2019s house. You didn\u2019t even realize he lived in the same state. You park your bike outside a fairly nice looking house. Your son\u2019s been doing something right.\n\nYou take a deep breath when you get to the door and stand there for a few seconds preparing yourself, and then ring the bell.\n\nThe door opens almost immediately and a feline face stands before you, this must be Irena. It\u2019s obvious she recognizes you, but predictably she doesn\u2019t look happy to see you.\n\n\u201cYou? What do you want?\u201d she demands, while Mary looks at you a little concerned about what you\u2019re going to say.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ask for Lawrence", "result": "\u201cLook Irena, I\u2019m not here to fight, I just want to see Lawrence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of whom, Lawrence arrives at the door; he\u2019s very surprised to see you.\n\n\u201cDad?! What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, you can thank Mary here for even convincing me though\u2026 look we need to talk in private, I can\u2019t be doing this shit in front of everyone.\u201d\n\nLawrence nods understanding completely and invites everyone in, Mary and Irena go off together while you and your son enter a study of some sort, where you have a fairly long talk. You find out that he runs his own security business, and is his own boss, which is something you can certainly respect. He excitedly tells about everything that\u2019s occurred in his life since you \u201cdisowned\u201d him. Its weird, he doesn\u2019t seem to hold any kind of grudge or anything towards you. He\u2019s just so happy you\u2019re here. Must be a trait he picked up from his human mother\u2019s side, because you know damn well he didn\u2019t inherit it from you. If the roles were reversed, you\u2019re certain you would\u2019ve slammed the door in your own face.\n\nFor once you\u2019re glad Lawrence isn\u2019t completely like you. You also realize that you have been unreasonable for all these years. You still don\u2019t approve of your son\u2019s choice in mates, but like Mary said, you need to get over it.\n\nJust then a couple of little furballs come wandering into the room, they look like Wolf cubs, but the unmistakable feline features are there. They look at you with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cHey, Tom and Isis. Come closer, I want you to meet someone.\u201d Lawrence says.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that Daddy?\u201d Tom asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your grandfather.\u201d Lawrence says picking one up. \u201cDad you\u2019ve never even seen your own grandchildren. You want to hold them?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026erm\u2026I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet Lawrence.\u201d You say\n\u201cOkay, I understand\u2026hey! We\u2019re having dinner soon, you should stay!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno it might be weird.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense! Look if you think you\u2019re going to get into it with Irena, I can tell you it won\u2019t happen if you don\u2019t say anything to her. She\u2019ll keep quiet if you do. I hope you can be a little civil, I know it sucks when I have to be civilized to clients for my job, but you know how it is.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know how it is. Alright I can do it. Hell, I\u2019ve come this far. This is a whole new experience for me. I hope just hope you\u2019ve got some good food.\u201d\n\u201cOf course! We\u2019re not vegetarians here you know!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good, or else I would\u2019ve had to disown you again!\u201d you badly joke.\n\nThere\u2019s a period of silence, and you think you might\u2019ve stepped over the line, however Lawrence begins to laugh.\n\n\u201cDisown me? If I become a vegetarian, just put a fucking silver bullet in my head! Ha ha!\u201d\n\nYou laugh too, and breathe a sigh of relief. You remind yourself that you\u2019ll have to do a better job of your words at the dinner table!\n\nDinner is a pleasant affair; Irena certainly is an excellent cook. In fact it looks like she\u2019s an excellent housewife in general. You\u2019ve noticed the house is spotless. She might be a house cat, but she\u2019s certainly not a lazy one. Maybe there are exceptions to Cat People. She doesn\u2019t talk to you, but she doesn\u2019t start anything either. Everyone eats except Mary who doesn\u2019t require it, but she looks happy that you\u2019re here making an effort to get along with everyone. You can\u2019t be sure, but you get the impression that she did this for herself as much as she did for you. Mary\u2019s own \u201cfamily\u201d is pretty fucked up and she\u2019s unable to have children of her own. Maybe in some ways she hoped to create a \u201csurrogate\u201d family that she could be apart of instead and all that was missing was you.\n\nThe doorbell rings.\n\n\u201cWho could that be?\u201d Lawrence asks Irena.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll go check.\u201d\n\nIrena gets up to answer the door and you can hear a loud voice in the next room.\n\n\u201cSis! It\u2019s so good to see you! How about a hug for your brother?\u201d\n\nYou hear some muttering and whispering, but can\u2019t quite make it out. A few seconds later, another Irena and another Cat Person enters the room. You don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s fat and scruffy. He looks like scum and smells like scum. All your previous good feelings immediately start to dissipate. Mary looks over at you.\n\n\u201cUncle Oliver!\u201d the furballs say in unison.\n\u201cHey, kids! It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you! I\u2019ll be staying here for awhile so we\u2019ll have lots of time to play!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like him.\n\n\u201cHey Lawrence\u2026I hope you\u2019ve been taking good care of my sister.\u201d He says with almost a hint of distain.\n\nYou really don\u2019t like him.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s this couple?\u201d he asks when noticing you and Mary. He gives you an unmistakable hostile stare.\n\nYou hate him.\n\nYou immediately whisper to Mary. \u201cWho the fuck is this shithead?\u201d\n\u201cIts Irena\u2019s brother, Oliver. I don\u2019t know too much about him, this the first time I\u2019ve met him in person.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave", "result": "There\u2019s a limit to your tolerance and you\u2019ve just reached it.

Remember all those rewrites?\u201d you give her hand a squeeze and look at her while moving your head slightly in the direction of Oliver. She gets the hint.\n\u201cOh yeah, we have to go.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well okay. I hope you\u2019ll come by again soon though!\u201d Lawrence says.\n\nAs you and Mary head towards the door, you turn back around and look at the house, look at his wife, look at his children and then look at that other\u2026 cat person. You can only change so much. You can\u2019t see yourself being \u201cpart of the family\u201d This is your son\u2019s life not yours.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see each other again someday.\u201d You say.\n\nLawrence looks a little disappointed, but understands.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a good time then.\u201d He replies.\n\u201cGoodbye and good luck son.\u201d\n\nYou and Mary get on your bike, wave goodbye and zoom off.\n\nDuring the ride you feel like you should say something to Mary, who you think is probably just as disappointed as your son was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mary, I just can\u2019t change that much.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I suppose it was too big of a step. You did really make an effort though, and you at least reconciled with Lawrence.\u201d\n\u201cHey I reconciled with you too\u2026so are we like moving in together or should we still keep our own places?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me? What\u2019s all this? Are you suggesting that we should get back together?\u201d\n\u201cWell you were the one who brought it up first, and yeah you were right about a lot of stuff. I probably should have someone special in my life at my age. And since you\u2019re about the only one who\u2019ll put up with me on a long term basis, you\u2019re the best candidate.\u201d\n\u201cWow, Wolf with words like that, you REALLY make a girl feel special!\u201d\n\u201cYou know I like everything else about you. I don\u2019t need to say it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, what makes you think I still want to be with you?\u201d\n\u201cOh please, you know you want this. Besides your hands are supposed to be around my waist, not fondling my crotch every five minutes.\u201d\n\nMary laughs at your remark and kisses you on the cheek.

Meanwhile you see Irena bring Oliver some food, Lawrence isn\u2019t paying attention as he\u2019s talking to his children, but you notice Oliver is lecherously looking at Irena the whole time. Then he begins stuffing his bloated face when Lawrence turns back around.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be staying here awhile Lawrence; I had a couple of job set backs. Might be awhile before I can find another one. Irena said it was okay.\u201d Oliver says while food hangs from his mouth.\n\n\nYou knew it. You goddamn well knew it. Typical fucking Cat Person. Fucking sponge.\n\n\u201cSure Oliver, you\u2019re family after all, your home is my home.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you have my thanks Lawrence. My sister is so lucky to have such a highly motivated well to do man such as yourself. Don\u2019t know why our family disapproved so much of you, but hey at least I was at the wedding, right Irena? There to give you away, right Irena?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yes Oliver.\u201d Irena says nervously and quickly goes back into the kitchen.\n\nSomething is seriously WRONG here. You\u2019ve hung around with some shady characters and known several creepy ones, and Oliver is just oozing with both traits. Even his sister doesn\u2019t seem to like him; she seems more scared of him than anything. Like an abuse victim. You don\u2019t understand why Lawrence is letting him talk like that.

Why are you letting Oliver talk shit like that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat Oliver? He\u2019s harmless. That\u2019s just how he is. Don\u2019t pay any attention.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m having a very hard time doing that.

Besides Oliver\u2019s the only family member on EITHER side who supported our wedding you know. He even paid for it. He might make comments every now and then, but I know he\u2019s supportive of us.\u201d\n\u201cLawrence, I know about letting things go, I\u2019ve been doing it all damn night, but I\u2019m telling you I can sense that he\u2019s up to no fucking good. He\u2019s been staring at his sister\u2019s tits and ass since he got here! It\u2019s like he\u2019s a psychotic stalker ex-boyfriend.

She\u2019d know the signs; after all she was married to that equally depraved fucker, Frankie.\n\n\u201cBut Wolf, shouldn\u2019t we try to do something else? I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat else can we do Mary? I already said what I thought and kicked Oliver\u2019s ass. Lawrence and Irena are going to have to take it from there. If I meddle anymore it\u2019s just going to make things worse, if you meddle, it\u2019ll just look like you\u2019re siding with me. Its Lawrence\u2019s family, it\u2019s his life, it\u2019s his choices, he\u2019s gotta be the one to sort it out. Hopefully he makes the right one. Come on Mary let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\nMary hops on the back of your bike and you zoom off. On the trip home Mary rests her head on the back of your shoulder while holding you and giving you a bit of a hugging squeeze every now and then. It\u2019s not really spoken, but it\u2019s apparent you and Mary are back together again, and hopefully Lawrence listens to your warning so you can someday reunite with him again as well.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay for the night", "result": "You\u2019ve come this far, you might as well go a little further.\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026alright\u2026I\u2019ll stay around, but just direct me to your spare bedroom or something because I refuse to be in the same room with Oliver. His mere presence sickens me.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, just go upstairs turn left and straight ahead. It\u2019s a blue room. I hope you\u2019re in better spirits tomorrow, I want to talk with you some more.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I hope you heed my warning Lawrence. See ya tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou head to the bedroom, which is a fairly large one. You stretch out on the bed thinking about everything that\u2019s happened today. It was going pretty well until fucking Oliver showed up. He just makes you want to rip his guts out and hang him with them until his tongue turns purple and sticks out. You\u2019ve never had to hold in your anger like this before, but you\u2019re trying to change. For the sake of Lawrence you\u2019re trying damn hard to change.\n\nAn hour passes and Mary enters the room.\n\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t sleep, or am I correct in assuming you\u2019re just isolating yourself so you don\u2019t kill someone? Lawrence told everyone you were tired, but I knew better. You don\u2019t like Oliver.\u201d\n\u201cCan you fuckin\u2019 blame me? I mean come on Mary, you fuckin\u2019 saw how he acts and how he is! Tell me you don\u2019t find SOMETHING wrong with the fucker.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know what you mean, I\u2019ve been down there talking with everyone, and assessing him as well, and he is creepy. Especially with Irena.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I tried to tell Lawrence, but he thinks I\u2019m just a bigot.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026you are, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to fucking do massive harm to that fucking cat\u2026\u201d\n\u201dWhoa, easy there. We don\u2019t actually know anything or have any proof of anything, he could just be harmlessly weird.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need proof when I\u2019ve got instinct! Arrgh! Why the hell isn\u2019t Lawrence using his?!\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, you\u2019re pretty tense, I think you need to work off some of that excess energy. Come on we worry about this tomorrow, for right now let\u2019s continue to discuss those movie rewrites.\u201d\n\nMary seductively hops on your lap and begins to kiss you all over.\n\n\u201cMmm, I was wondering if you still wanted to be with me after what happened back at the studio.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you mean that little argument we had? Please, I\u2019ve heard worse from you remember? I know you were just doing a lot of prideful macho posturing, which is kind of sexy actually. Beside I know damn well you want to be with me again, your actions of changing your views on Lawrence have proven that, not to mention your body is telling me right now.\u201d\n\nFour hours later, Mary is fast asleep, but you\u2019re still wide awake. This pleasant diversion still hasn\u2019t calmed you down. You slide out of bed to get a drink and go for a walk. On your way to the bathroom, you hear to whispering and mumbling from another bedroom. You listen closely.\n\n\u201cYou know Isis, you\u2019re growing into a pretty young feline, thank God you take after your beautiful mother.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Uncle Oliver, but why\u2019d you wake me up?\u201d\n\u201cJust to tell you that and to play a game with you. You see me and your mother used to play a game when we were younger, but it was a secret game. We didn\u2019t tell anyone, and you can\u2019t tell anyone either, especially not your Dad.\u201d\n\u201cUm I don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re rubbing my leg Uncle Oliver...\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s how the game is played, now let me just\u2026\u201d\n\nYou immediately burst through the door; Oliver\u2019s fat frame is lurching over Isis when he turns his head in your direction. His eyes wide open like a deer caught in the headlights.\n\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE DEAD, YOU SICK PIECE OF SHIT!\u201d you bellow and grab Oliver and throw him against the wall. Isis goes running and screaming from the room while you pound Oliver\u2019s face into a bloody pulp. He tries to bat you with his claws, but they don\u2019t even phase you, you\u2019re too angry and you\u2019ve been wanting to do this all fucking night. You throw him out of the room and into the hallway where you kick the hell out of him as he coughs up puke and blood. Mary arrives wondering what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cWOLF! STOP!\u201d\n\u201cNO! He was trying to molest Isis! I caught him right in the fucking act! I knew I was fucking right!\u201d you bend down and speak in his ear. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna make sure you don\u2019t ever try that shit on my granddaughter again, you fuck!\u201d\n\nYou begin shredding his balls and dick into pieces and howl of pain is sounded throughout the house, Tom at this point has woken up, but Mary takes him back to his own room and tells him to stay there.\n\nNow you\u2019re lurching over Oliver\u2019s bloody body ready to deliver the killing strike, when Lawrence and Irena arrive from downstairs. They look at you, they look at Oliver, then Irena says something you don\u2019t expect, but the look in her eye doesn\u2019t entirely surprise you.\n\n\u201cDo it Wolf.\u201d\n\nAnd you do, you drive your claws deep into his throat effectively decapitating him. After the deed is done, you and Lawrence dump the body (and head) in a nearby woods where nature can take care of it. Lawrence then speaks.\n\n\u201cWhen Isis told us what happened exactly, all I could think about is that I should\u2019ve listened to you. I\u2019m a fucking idiot, and failed you and my children.\u201d\n\u201cLook nevermind all that now son, what\u2019s important is the problem has been dealt with. YOU, just be on guard more in the future. Remember, you\u2019re the protector of this family, you have to suspect everything and everyone. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, trust your fucking instinct, its never wrong. Let\u2019s get back home, I gotta wash this cat blood off of me, I think he pissed on me too, ugh.\u201d\n\nThe following day you decide to leave, Lawrence wants you to stick around, but you tell Lawrence he needs to spend time with his family right now, not you. This time he listens to you. You and Mary get on your Harley, while Lawrence, Irena, Isis and Tom all say their good byes to you.\n\n\u201cBye Grandpa!\u201d Isis and Tom say in unison.\n\u201cBye you two. Remember, if someone starts trying to do something you don\u2019t like to you, scratch their eyes out!\u201d you reply patting them both on the head.\n\u201cThank you Wolf, for what you did\u2026you don\u2019t know how much it means to me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Irena, but you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cBye Dad, I do hope we\u2019ll see you again.\u201d\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\n\nYou start up the cycle and you and Mary zoom off.\n\nOn the trip home Mary rests her head on the back of your shoulder while holding you and giving you a bit of a hugging squeeze every now and then.\n\n\u201cSo are we going to actually get to those rewrites when we get back home, or are we going to just fuck our brains out again?\u201d you ask Mary jokingly.\n\u201cHow about we do the latter, I don\u2019t think the movie needs any rewrites now.\u201d\n\u201dWhat?! Dammit I told you I\u2019m not playing that cranky old grandpa part!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? You do an excellent job of it in real life.\u201d Mary taunts.\n\u201cHey don\u2019t joke like that! I got a public image to maintain!\u201d\n\u201cHa ha! Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019re still making the changes. Your image of being a distrusting combative asshole will be maintained\u2026and don\u2019t ever change that trait.\u201d Mary says while kissing you on the cheek.\n\n\u201cNo need to ever worry about that Mary, some things will never change.\u201d", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Be an asshole", "result": "So much for civility\u2026\n\n\u201cPeeyew!

Its true some of your other sons and daughters have disappointed you in some way for your strict ideology of how a \u201cTrue Werewolf\u201d is supposed to act, but Lawrence stepped over a line that can\u2019t be dismissed as simple weakness, if anything its treason at worst and perverted mental illness at best, especially since you had such high hopes for him.\n\nWhen Lawrence was a cub, he did everything he could to emulate you. You weren\u2019t in his life growing up of course since you\u2019d long moved on before you even knew he was born, but he did everything he could to learn about you and eventually seek you out when he grew up. You remember he first arrived on one of the sets he punched out two security guards who tried to escort him off. You knew then he was one of yours. He was very excited to finally meet you and for your part you liked him too. Here he was, wanting to model his life after yours, as opposed to complaining and whining about how you weren\u2019t there for him. Truly the survival instinct mindset was strong in this one. You spent time with him when you could. Indeed you wanted to. He didn\u2019t ask for hand outs either, he wanted to prove he could do everything himself.

Even the young pups today who you normally frown upon as being spoiled go around trying to hone their skills and maintain that fighting spirit. Cat People do no such thing.

Because you see that Cat People USED to be like Werewolves but then they completely gave into civilization and allowed themselves to become soft, fat and weak, and as long as you draw breathe on this shitty World you will NOT allow the Werewolf race to follow in their paw prints.

For the most part he comes across as a typical unflinching bureaucratic tight ass that does everything his superiors tell him to the letter. However he does have his own ambitions and plans but he\u2019s never competent enough to carry them through, since he can barely carry out plans of his superiors.\n\nThe incident that really destroyed his career was his failed invasion of Earth. After seeing that the Martians were so interested in the planet he convinced his superior called \u201cThe Great One\u201d that they should invade it and that he should lead the invasion force. He said he just needed one ship to do it too. The Great One up to that point wasn\u2019t too impressed with Ro-Man, but he indulged the fool and said he\u2019d get a promotion if he pulled it off. Ro-Man had it all planned out, he was going to WIPE out humanity (As he liked to say) and make the way clear for his own people to colonize. He developed a big death ray and everything.\n\nWhat happened next made every failed invasion by the Martians look like military genius in comparison.\n\nAfter he did all his long winded speeches, the governments of Earth pretty much dismissed him for the long winded blowhard he was and ignored him as a potential threat. Ro-Man was incensed and unleashed his \u201cDeath Beam\u201d and destroyed every Earthling on the planet\u2026\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what he thought happened, what really happened is when he turned the damn thing on he caused a power outage in his ship due to his bad wiring. After fumbling around in the dark for awhile and putting in a new fuse, his lighting came back on. Unfortunately for him not all the rest of his controls went back on line, but of course this genius didn\u2019t think to make sure. When he checked his scanners they didn\u2019t detect any life on Earth. It never occurred to him that all Earthlings hadn\u2019t been WIPED out and his scanners just weren\u2019t working.\n\nThinking he\u2019d succeeded in his plan he landed on Earth to check things out, but instead of landing some place that would\u2019ve tipped him off right away like a major city, he landed in the boondocks, where he ended up running into some very frightened humans who he figured were the only survivors on Earth. He spent the next few months chasing them around trying to kill them, until he started to get a hard on for some of the young human girls and then he was just trying to commit intergalactic rape at that point.\n\nWhat ultimately happened was some hunter caught sight of him and shot him in the ass with a heavy duty tranquilizer, thinking he was Bigfoot. (He wanted to capture him alive for a reward) When he woke up he was on the first saucer back home and deported in great shame. His planet was humiliated for his spectacularly idiotic failure. He was demoted several ranks after that and eventually just kicked off his planet and his citizenship revoked.

All you can do is deal with it head on and make the best of it. What\u2019re you going to do Gil? Move when the Martians arrive? Then move again when some humans build yet another factory by your new home and just keep going like that until you die? You got a chance here to pretty much live your dream of a relatively peaceful undisturbed life here. It\u2019s not going to get any better Gil. All you gotta do is stand up to the Martians.

Most of Moreau\u2019s citizens were killed in the cross fire of this battle. Dr. Moreau was found dead from a self-inflicted beam blast to the head (A weapon he picked up from a dead Martian no doubt) Some of the survivors claim his last words were \u201cSuch destruction\u2026 Why? Why? Why didn\u2019t they tell me?!\u201d\n\nThis massive devastation continued even after Godzilla killed all the Martians, apparently from some of the other survivor reports, he was tearing the place apart searching the entire island for something or someone.

Ordering you around, living on your hard work.\u201d\n\u201cShut up Wolf! Guard, I changed my mind! Kill this furball!\u201d\n\u201cWhen I said Janice wasn\u2019t your kind, I didn\u2019t mean the fact that she was a Wasp, I meant the fact that she NOT an insect! I mean look at her, she wasn\u2019t born that way! YOU were born an ANT! She became a half Wasp freak due to a failed human experiment!\u201d\n\u201cWell we know that, but still\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStill nothing! She\u2019s just using you for whatever twisted purpose she has and to make life easy for herself, just like she did when she was human! Think about it, who does all the work around here? It looks like you Ants! She only has you around because no human wants to work for her! AND even if she WAS all for making things better for insect people why is she so against Andre? Shouldn\u2019t HE be allowed in too? I mean sure he\u2019s a half freak, but so is Janice! Sounds like a double standard to me!\u201d\n\u201cThe mammal has a point\u2026you really aren\u2019t one of us, in any sense of the word. A Queen is supposed to breed to keep the colony alive, in all these years, you haven\u2019t even made that attempt, you\u2019ve just been telling us what to do with promises of a so called glorious future for our kind.\u201d\n\u201cUm, I haven\u2019t found the right guy\u2026erm\u2026Well what the hell do you want me to do mate with a pathetic mammal?

Granted he might be part human, but then as Wolf pointed out, so are you. We would look past that though since the children of such a pairing could be indoctrinated to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence! I will not fuck Andre! Andre is unfit!! He\u2019s a disgusting insect, who belongs in the trash! Now you Ants know your fucking place and kill this asshole! Your place is to serve your superiors!\u201d Janice says in anger.\n\nThat statement didn\u2019t go over to well. The Ant guards begin to look at Janice and click their mandibles. They then advance on her.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?! Stop! I command you! OBEY!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s orders go unheard, she attempts to escape out the window, but one of the guards grabs her legs before she can take flight. She stings one of them, but is ultimately ripped apart. There\u2019s bug guts and blood all over the place. The Ant guard you were speaking to earlier addresses you.\n\n\u201cYou can take whatever you like from this mansion; it was never our style, just more of Janice\u2019s human vanity at work. We prefer the tunnels we\u2019ve built Thank you for opening our eyes to reality. (Sigh) We wish it hadn\u2019t been true though, now we don\u2019t have any purpose once more, as strange as it may seem we prefer to serve in a hierarchy, it\u2019s just our nature.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, can\u2019t argue with nature. I know I for one, would love to be stalking humans on the foggy moors, but adaptation can be a bitch. I do have an idea though\u2026.\u201d\n\nYou gather as much money and valuables you can from the Mansion and head back to the bar where Andre\u2019s been waiting, he buzzes excitedly.\n\n\u201cWolf!

But she was my love and...\u201d\n\nYou smack Andre upside the head and then shove your paw in a nearby patron\u2019s beer to wash it. \u201cHey!\u201d the patron says and then sees you scowl causing him to retract his statement.\n\n\u201cAndre shut the fuck up and listen, I got you a better deal! You\u2019ll be set for life, with all the sugar and whatever else you want. You know all those Ant guards, Janice had? Well they\u2019re all willing to serve YOU, under a couple of conditions. You\u2019re in charge, but you can\u2019t think yourself inherently superior, you have to understand that you need them. You can\u2019t suddenly start thinking you\u2019re better than THEM just because you\u2019re technically the king.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Well, yeah sure I can do that. Being a fly has made me pretty humble. I\u2019ll be grateful more than anything.\u201d\n\u201cOkay second, TAKE A FUCKING BATH! Stop smelling like a garbage dump!\u201d\n\u201cTake a bath? Gee I dunno, that\u2019s a pretty big step Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cYou goddamn well better, if you want to score with all the Ant bitches there.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! Are you serious?!\u201d\n\u201cFucking dead serious. None of them have ever mated, given that in the past only the Queen is supposed to, but now most of them want to feel what its like before they die. Hell, some of them hold out hope that they\u2019ll produce offspring, to make their race thrive again. So, what\u2019s it gonna be? A shit eating bum, or a smooth pimp Superfly that gets to be serviced by a bunch of virgins?\u201d\n\nAndre doesn\u2019t even answer; he just thanks you quickly and runs out the door. You doubt if you\u2019ll ever see him again.\n\n\u201cLucky bastard.\u201d You say as you sit down and order a drink with your newly gained loot.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Antagonize her", "result": "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be taking me anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cOh and why not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026well let\u2019s just say, I\u2019d tell you, but only in private.\u201d\n\u201cSave your veiled threats, I\u2019m not impressed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat.

Guards leave us, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to handle this dog if he tries anything.\u201d\n\nAfter the guards leave Janice backs away from you, close to the window in case she has to make an escape. She\u2019s obviously intimidated by you, which is good.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re alone, speak.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just occurred to me that you\u2019re talking a lot of rhetoric, but not doing a whole lot about it. A so called Queen would be mating with SOMETHING to produce offspring. Surely you could\u2019ve used Andre for such a purpose, even if he was a so called lower class bum. As long as they\u2019re bugly and indoctrinated to the insect cause you shouldn\u2019t have any problems right? In fact I question this whole insect supremacy thing. While I don\u2019t doubt that YOU think you\u2019re superior, I wonder if you feel that way about THEM. I think you\u2019re just using THEM, to make your life more comfortable, and their dumb enough to believe your lies because they\u2019re a bunch of good little Ants that mindlessly follow a hierarchy because that\u2019s what they know best. However, they have been exploited in the past, namely by humans in their little wars. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d like to be suddenly reminded that something similar is going on here, because after all, when it comes down to it, you\u2019re not really one of THEM, you\u2019re just a half freak insect human who\u2019s taking advantage of the situation. You\u2019ve been lucky to get away with it so long, without any return investment on your part.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Okay, assuming that\u2019s all true\u2026and I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t\u2026what are you proposing?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. I delivered the letter to you; I expect a little something for it.\u201d\nJanice buzzes displeasingly, but she realizes she has little choice. She goes over to a wall safe and hands you everything in it.\n\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got your money, now get out of here!\u201d\n\u201cThanks, now what do you want me to tell Andre?\u201d\n\u201cAndre? Tell him to fuck off! I still don\u2019t want anything to do with that bum!\u201d\n\u201cYou know, maybe I\u2019m keeping quiet about your scheme, but that doesn\u2019t mean your Ant slaves won\u2019t catch on eventually. Maybe you should take precautions by considering Andre\u2019s offer, just some free advice.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. What\u2019s the big deal?

Not when there are all those young human girls to seduce and consume. Not to mention the eternally youthful Vamp girls. I think its time you lowered your standards. And as for your comments to me, I\u2019m a guy; the lowering of my standards doesn\u2019t apply to me. Maybe it\u2019s sexist and all that unPC shit, but that\u2019s the way the world works.

Along with giant spiders and mantises, the biggest problem was when an ant colony was struck by massive radiation and went undetected in the desert for a couple of years and wasn\u2019t discovered until giant ants began carrying off small children from nearby towns to their colony.\n\nGranted they were never as big as people saw in the movies (Such a size would cause them to collapse underneath their own weight) but they did grow to be as big as humans. In fact they took on the look of \u201cAnt centaurs\u201d. A torso with two arms and a back end with four legs, still all very antlike though. Initially they weren\u2019t very intelligent, but they grew smarter as time went on. This caused even greater problems for humans later.\n\nNow the \u201cAnt people\u201d weren\u2019t malevolent per say, but they just had a different outlook on life just like any other culture, and they saw humans (And anything else that went near their colony) as a source of food. Naturally humans and insects have never gotten along so it was only a matter of time before all out war was declared. The war might\u2019ve lasted longer if the Ant people were able to adapt a little better, and if humans hadn\u2019t had a severe tech advantage. The humans were determined to wipe THEM out before they could get the numerical advantage. This of course was done by blowing up their queen thus ending any chance of THEM ever conquering the Earth. The remaining Ant people would\u2019ve probably been mopped up, but by this time it was the 60s and civil rights and shit came about. Hippies started saying that they had the right to exist on their own land and such, so the remaining ones were eventually allowed to live, and in time they assimilated into society like everyone else. Nobody was sure of their life span, but the government still perceived THEM as a legitimate potential threat and didn\u2019t really want to take the chance that one of those ants could turn into another queen somehow, so a lot got drafted into the Vietnam War to \u201cthin out\u201d their population.

Still others just have some very bad luck. Andre falls into that category.\n\nEveryone knows the story, Andre was working on a teleportation device and when he tested it out a fly got in the thing with him and turned him into the big bug he is today. Contrary to what the movies say, there was NOT a fly buzzing around with his head on it after the accident! It was more like \u201cremake\u201d where his DNA combined with the fly\u2019s DNA, just one being, not two separate ones. (Though he did still have a big ol\u2019 grotesque fly head afterwards.) Needless to say his career as any kind of scientist was over, while his intelligence hadn\u2019t been reduced to that of a fly, it certainly lowered it from what it was, and tended to make him more focused on simpler things like eating.

His last hope was working in the \u201cSanitation Engineering\u201d field, which he thought would be perfect, but the problem was he spent too much time eating garbage rather than picking it up. He was fired within the week. Eventually his money ran out and he became a bum which probably wasn\u2019t that bad for him, indeed he was more \u201cfree\u201d now; ironic, since he started out from poverty and worked his way up from the gutter when he was a human and stated he\u2019d never want to be poor ever again.\n\nYou always avoided him for the same reasons everyone else did.

As with all humans they can\u2019t stop the ravages time without a little help, either supernatural or scientific. She attempted supernatural first, and tried to get one of those parasitic bloodsuckers to turn her. It would\u2019ve been perfect for her; the problem was no vampire was willing to do it.

(Which might explain why crosses don\u2019t really work so well in real life as opposed to the crap they show in movies) and since Fagula is the head cocksucker\u2026erm bloodsucker in charge, no vampire was going to defy him, even if they wanted to.\n\nJanice resorted to scientific means, so she hired some mad scientist type who was working on a youth serum based on wasp jelly.

They are a technologically advanced race which is amazing considering how stupid they actually are. It makes you wonder if natural selection even occurred on the dismal red planet.\n\nThe first Martian invasion was impressive since humans weren\u2019t prepared for it. Unfortunately for all their advanced weaponry their medical science was probably in the fucking toilet\u2026literally. They have to be the only galactic race of \u201cconquerors\u201d that lost a war because of dysentery. All the \u201cWar Machines\u201d in the world couldn\u2019t protect them from all the air born germs that infest humanity (They really are filthy when you think about it). You\u2019d think that they\u2019d take this information and try to combat it with\u2026uh you know inventing fucking vaccinations and penicillin. But did they do that? Nope. They tried to invade again this time they figured if they never got out of their machines at all they\u2019d be safe. Unfortunately in order to invade a planet you HAVE to have ground troops to do it. So while they blasted the shit out of the Earth again they couldn\u2019t properly conquer it. So these geniuses spent the rest of the time arguing about what they should do until all their flying saucers ran out of fucking fuel and started falling out of the sky, crashing into shit.\n\nAt this point you\u2019d think they\u2019d just give up, but they didn\u2019t. The next failed mission involved them stealing human women to breed with them. They figured two things:\n\nOne was that they could replenish all their soldiers again that they\u2019d lost in the last two invasions. The second idea was they figured they could create a hybrid that was more resilient to human germs.\n\nThe plan was doomed to failure in its typical Martian idiocy and this was a particularly spectacular one that nearly wiped them out permanently as well as effectively destroying them as a potential threat.\n\nFirst of all the Martians had to get OUT of their machines in order to kidnap these women. Sure they finally developed protective suits at this point, but they were made of a thin and easily ripped material. Many Martians died attempting to steal away feisty housewives. Second of all they would\u2019ve had to steal a lot more housewives than they did in order to replenish their severely depleted military (And male population in general) to say nothing of the fact they had to put up with the human women for at least 9 LONG months before they got a return on their \u201cinvestment\u201d. The third problem was for some reason it didn\u2019t occur to them that the germs would still be ON these human women! Many Martians died after mating with these kidnapped housewives, not to mention an \u201cEarth\u201d plague hit the entire planet now. More dead Martians and lots of them. The kicker of all this, was most of the \u201chybrid\u201d Martians that grew up tended to be very interested in their human heritage and would go back to Earth. (With their moms of course)\n\nThe only good thing that occurred was the survivors were now finally resistant to human germs. Little good it did now since half the planet died, and was in no position to invade anyone. (Luckily for them, humans were too busy fighting each other, or they would\u2019ve surely been defeated had humans invaded Mars).\n\nThe Martians tried a few more stupid invasions later, but they never were really serious and by that time humanity had caught up to them technologically. (Thanks to salvaging the technology from all those immobilized war machines and flying saucers that fell out of the sky) Nowadays Martians are considered the intergalactic equivalent of rude hillbilly neighbors with lots of guns.\n\nThey bring a whole new meaning to term \u201cREDneck\u201d.", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Memories (Henry)", "result": "The Split Personality: Dr. Henry Jekyll/ Mr. Edward Hyde\n\nHenry Jekyll was a typical bookworm human nerd that couldn\u2019t get a girl.
