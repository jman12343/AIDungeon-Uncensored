You are the lowest form of life in Carney society. You\u2019re not a real performer; what you do can\u2019t really be considered a skill. You\u2019re not even a real freak. At least a deformed freak can evoke an emotion of horror, or pity, or even admiration for overcoming their condition. You weren\u2019t born \u201cthis way\u201d. You chose to do this. All you evoke is disgust and revulsion. At best you\u2019re laughed at and not in the good way like those pervert clowns you work with.\n\nFuck all that \u201cWildman of Borneo\u201d shit that the Ringmaster tries to tell all the rubes. You\u2019re little more than a bum with a \u201cjob\u201d. A degrading job that involves you to debase yourself, all for the amusement and shock value of others, but hey it keeps a \u201croof\u201d over your head and you pleasantly drunk enough to just barely forget how utterly pathetic your life is.\n\nYou are the GEEK.\n\nYou wake up to a bucket of piss being thrown in your face. Not the first time and certainly won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\u201cYou like the taste of that Geek? Get up Geek! The Ring Master wants to see you!\u201d Charley orders then he throws the empty bucket at your head. The comical sound it makes hitting your skull and the pain it causes makes Charley laugh.

You smell even more disgusting than usual! I guess that\u2019s one way to keep Ajax from killing you, he\u2019d probably vomit his guts out before he could lay a hand on you\u2026then you could lick it up for the rubes! Ha ha! Move it Geek!\u201d\n\nCharley prods you with a sharp stick periodically on your way to the Ring Master\u2019s trailer until you arrive at which point, Atlas stops the both of you.\n\n\u201cStop! What business do the both of you have here?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit you fuckin\u2019 one eyed freak! We go through this all the fucking time and its getting REALLY old! You just saw me come out of the Ring Master\u2019s trailer earlier today when he sent me to get the Geek, you know damn well what we\u2019re both doing here!\u201d\n\nIgnoring Charley\u2019s comments Atlas looks down at you and points.\n\n\u201cYou may enter, but the Ring Master doesn\u2019t need to see you again, so you may not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, whatever enjoy the smell.\u201d Charley says and mumbles something to himself while leaving the area.\n\nYou barely make it up the little steps to the trailer, but you do. You\u2019re finally starting to gather your wits together; your head still hurts though and you\u2019ve just realize you haven\u2019t had a drink yet. What a terrible feeling. You open the door.\n\n\u201cClose the door, you\u2019re letting all the sunlight in.\u201d the Ring Master orders from behind his desk. She\u2019s siting in his chair, but has her back turned to you.\n\u201cUh you wanted to see me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u2026(Sniff sniff) you really haven\u2019t been taking care of yourself. If anything you\u2019ve become even more repulsive than when I first took you in. Remember that day?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah I think\u2026no, no I don\u2019t. I mean kind of\u2026 I forget things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised; you\u2019re constantly drinking that swill Charley makes. I am surprised you haven\u2019t gone blind yet though. Oh well what you insist on doing to yourself is of little concern to me, all I require is your obedience. You are thankful for all I have provided for you aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. Sure I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be one of the few nowadays then. There are some though that are ungrateful for things I\u2019ve done for them, they plan to betray me and everything this carnival stands for. They plan to change the natural order of things. Can you imagine what might happen to this carnival if I wasn\u2019t here? What might happen to you?\u201d\n\nYou attempt to think about this scenario, but instead you just stand there because you can\u2019t really form anything in your mind because it hurts really bad, you\u2019ve been sober too damn long, and it\u2019s about to get even longer as the Ring Master seems intent on bombarding you with talk as he finally swivels around in her chair. That pale androgynous face of the Ring Master\u2019s is displaying a look of seriousness as usual.\n\n\u201cNothing good I can assure you. Which is why I\u2019m putting YOU in charge of this task.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What task?\u201d\n\u201cWhy ensuring the survival of the carnival of course.\u201d\n\u201dWhat!? Me?! Why? How!? I\u2019m not qualified! Can\u2019t you or Charley do it?\u201d\n\u201cI fear I\u2019ve done all I\u2019ve can. I mean I\u2019ve provided all of THIS to everyone here. I\u2019ve given them purpose and a life. If that isn\u2019t enough for them, then my words aren\u2019t going to make a difference at this point. And as for Charley, well\u2026I\u2019m sure even in your usual state of drunkenness you\u2019re aware that he has his own plans for this carnival.\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026but agh, it\u2019s too early for all this\u2026why me? I mean what am I supposed to do? I\u2019m just the Geek.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m choosing you. You have no motive, you have no agenda, you have no friends, and as such you would probably be the best candidate to convince others to resist change and keep the status quo.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to be joking! Nobody\u2019s going to listen to me! I\u2019m the fucking Geek!\u201d\n\u201cYou might be surprised, you have far more potential than you give yourself credit for\u2026perhaps you\u2019ll even change some perspectives, or maybe not. The choice is yours, because the fate of THIS carnival is resting solely on your actions, you can no longer afford to hide from the world in a bottle and a cage if you wish to keep your current life. It is time for you to take some responsibility, its time to repay the debt you owe me. You have until show time.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow leave me, I wish to be alone.\u201d\n\nThe Ring Master swivels his chair back to its original position. You head back outside, where upon Atlas blocks it again with his massive body.\n\nNever before in your life have you been put in this kind of position of responsibility, (Not that you can remember anyway) but you\u2019re going to have to do something, the question is what exactly?", "action_results": [{"action": "Obey the Ring Master", "result": "You feel you don\u2019t really have a choice in this situation.

What a terrible thing. Now you have to figure out who you need to convince.\n\nThe Freaks are firmly on the side of the Ring Master, so you don\u2019t need to talk to them. That just leaves the Midgets and the Normals, both of those present some problems.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to convince the Midgets", "result": "Charley leads the Midgets and you doubt if he\u2019s going \u201cfall in line\u201d and even if he claimed he was, he\u2019d just be lying. You might even be putting yourself in great danger by speaking to him directly about this, however you know the Midgets don\u2019t really care for Charley, so if you could get him out of the way somehow, they might be more willing to ally with the Ring Master.\n\nYou decide to \u201ctest the waters\u201d by speaking to one of the few Midgets (Actually the only one) that\u2019s somewhat less hostile towards you. You see Bob working on hammering tent stakes in the ground and go up to him.\n\n\u201cHey Bob, can I talk to you?\u201d\n\u201cAw hell Geek, I ain\u2019t got no money for you to get fucking drunk! Just go steal the liquor from that sonofabitch Charley and take your goddamn chances!\u201d he says barely paying attention to you.\n\u201cNo, its not that\u2026so you uh think Charley\u2019s a son of a bitch huh?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it, I know it. Everyone does.\u201d\n\u201cSo why do you guys follow him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he does make things better for us. Better than the Ring Master did anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but what if he\u2019s not the best choice to lead you guys, I mean\u2026\u201d\n\nBob raises one eyebrow and focuses all of his attention on you now.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talkin\u2019 about Geek? You seem to be awfully interested with matters that don\u2019t concern you.\u201d Bob states raising his hammer menancingly.\n\u201cWell um\u2026I just heard that\u2026um Charley\u2026I mean\u2026look there\u2019s some shit gonna go down and the Ring Master wants me to get people on his side!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re unsure of what Bob\u2019s going to do about your revelation. You expect the worst, but for once luck is on your side.\n\n\u201cLook Geek, I ain\u2019t gonna lie to ya, not many of us like Charley, and sure, he\u2019s a fucking tyrant, but he gets things done, I dunno he\u2019s kinda like that guy in Germany, except shorter. However, if he wasn\u2019t around, we\u2019d go back to being second class citizens again and why? We DO keep this place running. The Ring Master claims he cares about us, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way to us. We\u2019re under appreciated. And if Charley does have ideas about taking over, then we\u2019re behind him. Maybe the whole place would be run a lot better with him in charge anyway. AND I suggest you don\u2019t talk to any other dwarves about this, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get the same answer and they might just feel the need to tell Charley about the discussion and I don\u2019t think that would be very good for you.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do or say to change your mind?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn it, weren\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 listening Geek? I said no! Not unless you found someway of replacing Charley with someone a little more even tempered and with his business savvy.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t one of you midg\u2026I mean dwarves do it?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Because most of us are simple laborers. We just wanna do our job with as little hassle and relax when we can, we don\u2019t wanna be worried about extra shit. Let Charley worry about it since he wants it so bad. Besides if you haven\u2019t noticed he\u2019s got a mean streak a mile wide and that fuckin\u2019 muscle bound freak Ajax around him all the time.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nobody who\u2019d want to take Charley\u2019s place?\u201d\n\u201cNope. The only one I can think of who\u2019d even have the intelligence of running the criminal activity here smoothly anyway would be his overgrown girlfriend Salina. Now her I wouldn\u2019t mind working under if you know what I mean! Hah! Now get the fuck outta here Geek, I got work to do and your smell is gonna stick to my clothes for days! Get!\u201d\n\nYou back away from Bob before he hits you with his hammer or kicks you in the shin.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t what you expected, but perhaps Bob has subtlety shown you a way to get the midgets to ally with the Ring Master, but of course this means talking with Salina. That could be even more risky though, considering she\u2019s the object of Charley\u2019s \u201clove\u201d. Not to mention she doesn\u2019t particularly like you.\n\nBut then again, who does?", "action_results": [{"action": "Go talk to Salina", "result": "You cautiously approach Salina\u2019s trailer, you\u2019re nervous as hell. You stop and hide behind a nearby barrel when you see someone coming out. It\u2019s Sasha. She looks like she\u2019s been crying, probably about Ajax no doubt. Salina seems to be telling her something and then hugs her before closing the door. When Sasha leaves you knock on Salina\u2019s door. She answers.\n\n\u201cLook, I told you\u2026UGH! Its you! Get the fuck outta here Geek! No amount of money is gonna make me degrade myself for your festering ass! And you\u2019re upsetting my snakes with your odor!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, I really gotta talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say that I wanna waste my time OR my sense of smell on, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease it s really important! It\u2019s about Charley and the future of the Carnival!\u201d\n\nSalina raises her eyebrow.\n\n\u201cHmm, very well, but you\u2019re not coming in here, let\u2019s go someplace secluded where nobody can see me associating with you.\u201d\n\nYou and Salina walk to a nearby spot in the wilderness (Separately of course) to talk where you explain the situation to Salina.\n\n\u201cYeah, so what does all this mean to me? If Charley takes over I win and if the Ring Master stays in power I still win. I don\u2019t see why I should get involved in this power struggle.\u201d Salina says unemotionally.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at the big picture. As it stands now you got some measure of freedom, but if Charley wins, this place will cease being a Carnival and become a crime ring. And while you might do alright gift and money wise, you\u2019ll be Charley\u2019s girlfriend full time at that point with little freedom. You know he\u2019s never going to let you do anything without his approval if he\u2019s in power. And if the Ring Master wins, chances are the criminal activity here is gonna be severely diminished without Charley to run it, meaning you\u2019ll probably be making less money.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026but don\u2019t you want the Ring Master to win?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but she needs allies and I\u2019m trying to get the midgets to ally with him and they won\u2019t if Charley\u2019s in charge of them.\u201d\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t understand, what exactly are you proposing? You\u2019re kind of all over the place here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I want YOU to take over Charley\u2019s position. You run all his business dealings.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re crazy Geek.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You\u2019re intelligent; surely you probably know all of Charley\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\u201cWell THAT\u2019S true. The little fucker insists on bragging about everything after sex, but what makes you think the midgets will follow me? I mean I\u2019m a Normal.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019re a tall beautiful woman, the midgets will love you, didn\u2019t you see Wizard of Oz? Just as long as you promise to uphold all the things Charley did like protection from being bullied by rubes and keeping their payment the same, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll mind you in charge instead of Charley. Think about it, YOU could be in charge of the whole operation, and it\u2019s not like the Ring Master will bother you as long as you don\u2019t try to screw with the everyday Carnival workings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never do that, the Carnival has been like a home to me\u2026I\u2026\u201d\n\nSalina seems to stop herself before she displays too much emotion to you.\n\n\u201cAlright Geek, I\u2019m willing to entertain this idea, but you have to do something for ME first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, what?\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta get rid of Randal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why? What did he do?\u201d\n\u201cTo me? Nothing, but he\u2019s competition and I can\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\u201cCompetition for what?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind, just get rid of him. Think of it this way, if you get him out of the picture, you\u2019ll also eliminate the leader of the third faction here which would really cement the Ring Master\u2019s supremacy here. Surely that should be incentive enough?\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to kill him?!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care HOW you get rid of him, just get rid of him before show time. If you do that, you can tell the midgets that I\u2019ll be taking over Charley\u2019s position when the time comes. Now don\u2019t speak to me again until you do this.\u201d\n\nLooks like you got MORE work ahead of you and you really don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to get rid of Randal. You doubt if just asking him to leave is going to work, and while killing him would solve the problem, it\u2019s not really that simple to just kill a man even if you had it in you.\n\nYou could really use a drink\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk to Randal", "result": "You can\u2019t kill Randal, so you\u2019re going to have to just try to convince him to leave\u2026somehow.

Now leave me, we must prepare.\u201d\n\nYou leave Madam Orbec\u2019s tent and go find Randal.

Atlas, if you would be so kind to escort this former employee of the premises\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the Ring Master says that, it typically means \u201cAtlas, after you break his neck make sure the body is properly disposed of.\u201d\n\nAtlas grabs Charley who attempts to defend himself with his sharp stick, but instead it\u2019s taken from him and broken. Then Charley\u2019s spine is taken from him and broken. Atlas lumbers off in the darkness to get rid of Ajax and Charley\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, I trust we\u2019ll have no problems Salina?\u201d The Ring Master asks.\n\u201cNo problems from me, I have all I need, or I soon will have.\u201d\n\u201cGood, I suggest you and your new friends get some rest, we got a big show tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhile Salina and the munchkin brigade leave and the freaks disperse as well, the Ring Master calls you out.\n\n\u201cGeek, you may come out of hiding, I\u2019m sure you can see the danger is over, not that there ever was any.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually worked. Everything\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSee? I told you, you underestimated yourself. Not only did you save the Carnival, but you stabilized it even more. I told you, I saw potential even when there was none apparent. Do you still want to be a Geek? You could be so much more if you just put in the effort. Charley used to do all my leg work, but now that he\u2019s gone I need someone else to fit that role\u2026would you be interested? Keep in mind that this new job would require a whole lot more responsibility and significantly less drinking as I would need you in a better frame of mind.\u201d\n\nAt one time you\u2019d balk, but after seeing what you accomplished first hand, maybe you DO have potential. You accept and you\u2019re given Charley\u2019s old trailer.\n\nTime goes by and you stumble along the way with the first few months as you still have a really bad drinking problem, but fortunately the Ring Master is slightly understanding about that, and only sends Atlas to remind you ONCE to get it under control. (That incident really sets you on the straight and narrow) you get yourself cleaned up and actually become presentable. You\u2019re more of an organizer than a main event now, but you still go ahead and bite some chicken heads off every now and then for the kids.\n\nSalina is a pretty fair and even handed business woman when it comes to the being new leader of the midgets. Much more than Charley, and she also has Pervus and his clown crew eliminated during one night. Apparently they got rough with one of her girls. They were all found dead the next day. Nobody said anything outright, but the fact that little snake bites were found on their bodies was a pretty good idea who was responsible. However, the Ring Master said nothing since Pervus and his friends had it coming for a long time, not to mention with them gone things actually improved morale wise. (People tend to work better when their aren\u2019t evil demented clowns lurking around)\n\nYou also see Salina and Sasha get very close in a way that makes you tingle in the nether regions. Now you know why Salina wanted you to get rid of Randal. Without Ajax to kick her around anymore, Sasha probably would\u2019ve fell for Randal (You also found out Madam Orbec told him he needed to leave the Carnival to find some magic book in some Mayan ruins that the spirits commanded him to retrieve\u2026he never returned) but since he wasn\u2019t around, she ended up with Salina. They seem to be happy though.\n\nActually everyone at the Carnival seems to be a lot happier and more relaxed and it\u2019s all due to your actions.\n\nThe Ring Master has given you a second chance at life, a life with a whole hell of lot more meaning.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten respect at last.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Kill Randal", "result": "You\u2019ll have to kill him.

There\u2019s also a black leather mask covering his face now and some sort of ball gag\u2026he looks completely docile and broken.\n\nSuddenly Charley seems to get a little less hostile, the rest of the midgets also look less than willing to fight now, though he\u2019s still not backing down completely.\n\n\u201c\u2026so that\u2019s what happened to Ajax\u2026(Sigh)\u2026alright Ringy you win.

Charley was right they have more in common with him than they do the Ring Master. Charley leaves with his midget gang. The Ring Master looks like he\u2019s going to order an attack, but decides against it. Instead he just assigns some Normals to do the job of the midgets and orders the rest to seek out new recruits in the next town.\n\nEveryone disperses leaving just the Ring Master, Atlas and you alone.

The Freaks seem to dislike the fact that the Ring Master isn\u2019t \u201cfavoring\u201d them as much anymore, but she\u2019s just trying to keep things fair so his Carnival stays together. The criminal activity goes down quite a bit. (Though someone\u2019s always still making hooch so happily you still have a steady supply of booze to grab)\n\nWith Ajax out of the way Sasha grows closer to Randal who returns these feelings. This new relationship makes him a little less \u201cuptight\u201d and more willing to take chances and less likely to go running to Madam Orbec before he does anything. His \u201cthreats\u201d of taking over start becoming more likely. Another rift in the Carnival is expected to occur and finally does, starting with the fiery death of Pervus and his clowns.\n\nSince the Ring Master was always looking for more help, Pervus and his clown crew took it upon themselves to start \u201crecruiting\u201d unsuspecting townies and rubes to come work for the Carnival, this causes them to start engaging in debauchery on a bigger scale than before, to an extent that they become a liability and more obvious. Randal, still having a great sense of ethics and morality could not stand by and let it go on any longer. He and several other Normals set fire to the entire tent in the middle of the night killing them all. (And putting the \u201cGimpjax\u201d out of his misery.)\n\nThe Ring Master was furious that Randal would take such a liberty. Another battle comes close to occurring, but fortunately for the Ring Master,(Who would\u2019ve been greatly outnumbered) Randal doesn\u2019t want to fight over the Carnival, instead he convinces his followers to leave while they started their OWN Carnival. One that was more family friendly and without Freaks all over the place. He leaves with Sasha and most of the other Normals in tow.\n\nThe Carnival becomes much smaller and is little more than a traveling Freak show as they are practically the only ones still left. The Ring Master doesn\u2019t seem to mind though, as he said, the Carnival would survive, maybe not in the same way, but its still around.\n\nAnd you still remain the GEEK.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, null]}, {"action": "Get a drink", "result": "If you\u2019re going to do anything you have to get a drink first, you head over to Charley\u2019s still, you can only hope Ajax isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that smell?

Normal, Midget and Freak alike.\n\n\u201cCome on come Geek, we ain\u2019t got all fuckin\u2019 night.\u201d Charley says while kicking you in the ribs.\n\nYou pull down the underwear\u2026\n\n\u201cEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWW!\u201d the crowd shouts in unison.\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d you say falling back.\n\u201cHa ha, I knew it!\u201d Charley chuckles before continuing.\n\n\u201cAlright you lot, I want all these bodies cleaned up and disposed of before we head out to the next town, and Salina I want YOU in my new trailer to help me celebrate this glorious victory!\u201d\n\nAnd so begins the reign of Charley the Ringmaster.

While regular carnival activities still abound, they\u2019re more of a cover than anything. In time, most of the high maintenance acts are done away with and eventually only thing that stays completely the same is the freak show, just to upkeep the front for what\u2019s really going on. The Pinheads get their own special attraction since they take up the clown vacancy.\n\nYou do somewhat better under the new management. You still do your act as it\u2019s still a big draw; you get lumped in with the Freak Show. You don\u2019t need to put up with Ajax\u2019s abuse anymore so fearing for your life isn\u2019t a factor. (Though the Pinheads still verbally warn you every now and then to ensure your secrecy) Charley uses you as a gopher, so you\u2019re actually making money now (If little).

So you\u2019ve all decided to throw your lot in with petty criminal activity. I\u2019m glad to see your hypocrisy show its true face Randal, and Geek, I\u2019m very disappointed in you. Very well, if I die this day, it\u2019ll be beside those who are the true heart of Carnival! ATTACK!\u201d\n\nThe battle ensues, though it\u2019s not really a battle. A few of the Normals side with the Ring Master, but most of them are on Charley\u2019s side. The only thing that makes the battle last longer is the fact that the Freaks are fierce fighters. Atlas and Ajax lock horns, and while Atlas nearly kills Ajax, Randal does a couple of his magic tricks and blinds Atlas with a bright light, giving Ajax enough time to kill him.\n\nOn the side lines watching, is Pervus and his clown gang masturbating to the carnage.\n\nFinally in the last moments Charley laughs as he stands over the Ring Master\u2019s body which is now lifeless with Charley\u2019s sharp stick through its heart; the last \u201cFreak\u201d to die.

While regular carnival activities still abound, they\u2019re more of a cover than anything. In time though problems occur. Randal and Charley begin to come into conflict as Randal begins to regret his decision to side with him as well as his disapproval of what\u2019s become of the Carnival. Another division begins to occur, but one on a smaller scale as Charley\u2019s corrupting influence has infected most of the remaining Carneys at this point. Things really come to a head when Ajax suspects Sasha of having an affair with Randal. Eventually Randal, a few of his remaining \u201cfollowers\u201d AND Sasha are all killed in the middle of night and their bodies dumped in the river. Lacking any more \u201ctrue talent\u201d or even sideshow freaks, the Carnival is disbanded entirely and Charley and Ajax set up headquarters permanently in a sleazy small town where they primarily run the place. Proving that crime does pay.\n\nYou on the other hand don\u2019t do so well. While the Carnival was still around, you were routinely abused by Charley or Ajax more so than you normally were. When the Carnival disbanded you didn\u2019t really have anywhere else to go, so you became the town drunk. Not really needing you anymore and having moved on to more important things, Charley forgets all about you, which leads to one dark rainy night when Ajax comes across you sleeping behind one of his bars.

And yours is an easy read indeed, such as it is\u2026perhaps our meeting has its purpose however. After reading your soul I can see something within you that may be worth saving. I never thought it possible, but I think I may be able to help you and your situation Geek.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cYes you do. Maybe you try to block it out of your mind with that swill you drink from Charley, but deep down you hate what you are and your retched life. And you should.

And I\u2019ll help you, if you help me.\u201d\n\u201cHow am I supposed to help you?\u201d\n\u201cA simple task really. All I want you to do is go get Madam Orbec\u2019s black book. She keeps it by her bed. You\u2019ll know it when you see it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You want me to steal from her? I thought she was supposed to be your mentor or something!\u201d\n\u201cShhhhh! Keep it down Geek! Look. Madam Orbec IS my mentor and I\u2019ll always be grateful for what she\u2019s taught me. I\u2019ve always believed in magic, but without her teachings, I wouldn\u2019t be a magician, I\u2019d only be an illusionist.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d you interrupt.\n\u201cOh yes, Geek. Oh yes. Anyway, you\u2019re not stealing the book, I just need to borrow it for awhile because its time for me to learn more. I think Madam Orbec is afraid I\u2019m not yet prepared to learn the secrets that lie inside her black book. But I know I am, and its time for me to prove it to her.

I\u2019m not helping you do that! I\u2019m supposed to be helping the Ring Master anyway!\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Seriously, what has the Ring Master really done for you? Given you a job? The Ring Master is exploiting you for his own personal gain. She cares nothing for you. He just saw a useless dreg of society and turned you into something that could somehow make money for her. Assuming you helped the Ring Master and were even successful, think about it, you\u2019d just go back to your living your miserable life. Is mere existence just enough for you?

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do to improve myself at this point.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, there\u2019s always a way and your first step is by helping me. Look. Maybe you are what you are and I don\u2019t like it, but I do see that underneath it all you ARE a Normal. You should be on my side anyway; I can help you be something more than a geek.

You can understand why people do tend to want to follow him. Maybe things would be better if he took over.

I\u2019m just winded from trying to get out there without her seeing me!\u201d\n\u201cWell you better make yourself scarce until showtime anyway.

Now go.\u201d\n\nYou leave and linger around the edges of the Carnival, staying out of sight until show time. What happened back at Madam Orbec\u2019s tent still has you unnerved a bit. You know it\u2019s only a matter a time before everyone finds out, before Randal finds out. She was basically like a mother figure to him. You didn\u2019t think Pervus would kill her, unless he didn\u2019t mean to and more likely he was just so overwhelmed with lust that he didn\u2019t care at that point.\n\nIn fact you\u2019re a little worried about being here by yourself with no one around. You half think Pervus is going to leap out somewhere and kill you too to shut you up. It would be exactly like him to do something like that. In fact now you think its weird to you that he HASN\u2019T shown up to kill you.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lot of potential enemies right now, Pervus, the Ring Master, not to mention plain old Ajax who always wants to kill you. Randal is pretty much your only hope for survival now.\n\nEventually you wander back to the Carnival around show time. Everything goes as normal with a few exceptions. The Ring Master looks pre-occupied, Randal\u2019s act seems to be a lot more spectacular than usual, the clowns nowhere to be seen and all throughout the show you have a dreaded feeling that something really bad is going to happen.\n\nAnd you just may be right.", "action_results": [{"action": "Because the real show occurs afterwards", "result": "A dark moonlit night.\n\nCharley confronts the Ring Master with his army of midgets behind him as well as Ajax.

All you do is crawl away and try to hide under a trailer and hope Randal wins, which he looks like he\u2019s doing.\n\nRandal has the upper hand in every way, he has numerical superiority for one thing, and the other thing is he\u2019s casting actual magic spells. A couple of bolts of lightning fry Ajax and Charley. Another spell strikes down Atlas. All looks good for Randal\u2026until Pervus and his clown crew show up.\n\nWhen you first see them, they look like they\u2019ve already been in a fight. They\u2019re walking in a shambling motion and have wounds on them. When they get closer those wounds look like mortal one. In fact they are.\n\nPervus and the clowns are no longer among the living.\n\nIt takes awhile for anyone else to recognize this. Randal just thinks he\u2019s got more allies until they start biting other Normals (as well as some remaining Midgets and Freaks). Upon seeing this, he tries to cast another spell to destroy them, but is stopped when one of the previously dead bodies on the ground rises up and bites his leg. When he cries out, he sees another familiar face. Madam Orbec, who while dead, looks obviously displeased by the theft of her book.\n\n\u201cI TOLD YOU NOT TO USE THIS BOOK! NOW SUFFER ALONG WITH THE REST OF US!\u201d she shouts and bites a chunk of Randal\u2019s throat out. He falls to the ground to be consumed by more of the dead and the book goes flying out of his hand.\n\nAll of the bodies have risen now. They\u2019re attacking everyone living, you take this as your moment to escape, when you scramble from under the trailer you feel a very strong grip tighten around your shoulder. You look up and see the Ring Master.\n\n\u201cMy poor sad Geek. I told you that you would learn to regret your decision to betray me. I have to thank you though, while my Carnival may be no more, perhaps it was time for a change, and with this book (The Ring Master shows you the black book that Randal lost) I think I can make a lot of them.\u201d\n\nYou try to struggle, but its no use. The Ring Master has an unnaturally strong grip on you. He walks directly towards the zombie horde, dragging you along.\n\n\u201cWhy?! Why aren\u2019t they attacking you?\u201d is the last thing you cry out.\n\u201cSilly Geek, haven\u2019t you at least figured that one out by now?

You feel a force hit you several times. You see sheer depravity in your mind! It overwhelms you, you begin to cry, and laugh at the same time. You immediately run back out to hide somewhere utterly mad from what you saw.\n\nYou run off to the nearest town hoping nobody comes looking for you, and nobody does due to what happens at show time\u2026\n\nWith the black book in his possession, Pervus goes back to his own tent and begins reading it, wondering what you wanted it for. Soon he begins to discover the power contained inside. The reason why Madam Orbec never wanted Randal to use it is due to the evil contained within and didn\u2019t want that evil unleashed lest it destroy him. Of course Pervus isn\u2019t a choir boy like Randal, he embraces the evil and the evil embraces him. It\u2019s a match made in hell.\n\nWhen show time comes around he and his whole degenerate clown crew begin chanting from the book unleashing horrible powers. Many in the audience are killed as they attempt to escape, the Ring Master attempts to restore order, but with one utterance by Pervus, a burning black light annihilates her. The next blast destroys Atlas.\n\nRandle attempts some sort of cheap magic defense, but he\u2019s powerless against the sheer destruction Pervus is wreaking. Eventually some of the clowns surround and capture him and do unspeakable things to him until he\u2019s literally an empty husk.\n\nCharley and Ajax attempt to escape, but are run down and torn apart by strange shadow creatures that were summoned up.\n\nThe ones that manage to survive that terrible night become part of this twisted new Carnival that now travels the night seeking to pull more victims into its dreaded den of wickedness and suck their souls dry, with Pervus as the new crazed ring master.\n\nAnd while you weren\u2019t there for the event, you SAW it all, in your mind back at Madam Orbec\u2019s tent.

The only thing she wants people to know and remember is that he is definitely in charge.

Of course he takes great delight in making people miserable whenever it suits him. He has found a like minded partner in Ajax the Strongman who acts as his muscle when the need arises. He\u2019s a first class sonofabitch, but he probably makes the carnival more profitable than it is.\n\nMidgets represent most of labor workforce in the carnival and being the \u201cBiggest\u201d and toughest midget at the carnival makes him their unofficial leader which the rest of the midgets have mixed emotions about, but with all his connections and power there is little that they can do about it even if they wanted to. Charley constantly reminds them that they are the real backbone of the carnival and also reminds them how townies and rubes would often pick on them for fun and ever since he arrived they don\u2019t do that anymore lest they suffer the consequences.

(To extend his height no doubt) He feels that with Ajax and \u201chis people\u201d behind him he\u2019ll be able to launch a take over when the time is right. All he needs to do is get a few more of the others to side with him.\n\nAs for you, Charley likes to take any free opportunity he has to humiliate you, which seems rather pointless given you don\u2019t have any self-respect to begin with, still it makes him laugh. Chances are if he did take over the Carnival you\u2019d still have a \u201cjob\u201d since Charley wouldn\u2019t want to get rid of his favorite whipping boy.\n\nThe Remarkable Randal\n\nRandal is the appointed spokesperson for the \u201cnormal\u201d Carneys such as the acrobats, tightrope walkers and other performers that rely on their genuine skills rather than their genetic conditions. Randal himself is a magician, but makes no pretense that he actually has any kind of real magical powers, but he believes magic exists. He\u2019s constantly acquiring old books hoping that someday that he can learn how to perform real magic one day. Randal is a bit of an optimistic dreamer, he believes the carnival is supposed to be a place of fun and wonder for the whole family. He IS that boy that ran away to join the circus in a sense as he did run away from his family who were fundamentalists that believed him to be dabbling in Satanic worship with his magic tricks.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t really like the idea of the carnival having \u201cfreaks\u201d for the sake of having them. He feels its pandering to the lowest common denominator and cheapening the other Carnies who actually have to rely on a learned skill and he really doesn\u2019t approve of all the illegal activity that goes on (Especially in a place which is supposed to be for the children) he blames the Ring Master as much as Charley for this, since the Ring Master turns a blind eye to it when he should be stopping it.\n\nRandal is a little more open about his rebellious nature than Charley and complains to the Ring Master whenever he gets the chance, (One of the few that gets away with it without consequences) to which his last response was if he doesn\u2019t like the way things are being run, he can either leave or make his move. So far Randal hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, so maybe he\u2019s going to take the Ring Master up on his challenge. Charley thinks he\u2019s a lot of talk and doesn\u2019t think he really has the balls to do it so he\u2019s not worried about him.\n\nConsidering Randal\u2019s views, you might find yourself out of a job if Randal got things his way. Shock value and Freaks wouldn\u2019t really have a place in Randal\u2019s carnival. Unsurprisingly Randal finds you and your act disgusting and completely unsuitable for anyone, especially children. (Even though the kiddies really like throwing chickens at you)", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Cast of Characters (The Secondary Acts)", "result": "Ajax the Strongman\n\nWhile Charley has delusions of grandeur, he is somewhat grounded in reality enough not to believe he\u2019s invincible. Ajax on the other hand probably thinks he could catch a bullet in his teeth and spit it back at his assailant. The man is completely narcissistic. Undoubtedly he is in good shape, very strong and probably a lot better looking than most of the Carnies, and he takes every opportunity to let everyone know it. He sneers at all the other guys for being \u201clesser\u201d than him (Save Charley, Atlas and the Ring Master) and of course shamelessly grabs at any woman that strikes his fancy. So pleased with his own body image that he basically walks around in a loin cloth at all times. Even when the Carnival is someplace cold and snowing. He\u2019d probably walk around naked if he could get away with it.\n\nWhy he\u2019s allied with Charley given his own arrogance and his \u201cnormie\u201d status might cause some to wonder, but the reasons aren\u2019t far fetched. Besides Ajax\u2019s own criminal mentality, Ajax is an opportunist, and he\u2019ll make more money under Charley and he thinks Charley is going to be on the winning team (Especially with him on his side) Not to mention Ajax doesn\u2019t really like the Ring Master. Never has. His pale androgynous nature really creeps him out. And the Remarkable Randal is a pussy as far as Ajax is concerned.\n\nAnother person that Ajax definitely doesn\u2019t like is you. While most others will simply avoid, taunt or abuse you for awhile for amusement, Ajax HATES you and has nearly beaten you to death a couple times. Presumably he sees you as a pathetic example of the male specimen that should\u2019ve been killed at birth and while he may be right, he\u2019s kept in check by Charley and/or the Ring Master from carrying out his desires. (As a rule Carneys are NOT supposed to kill each other\u2026well unless there\u2019s a good reason for it)\n\nYou\u2019d be in a world of shit if something ever happened to both of them.\n\nAtlas the Cyclopean Giant\n\nIf there\u2019s one person that\u2019s possibly stronger than Ajax, it\u2019s Atlas. (He\u2019s certainly scarier) He\u2019s an eight foot Cyclops that wears a hood covering everything except a single unblinking eye. He stands outside the Ring Master\u2019s trailer at all times not letting anyone pass unless the Ring Master wishes it. Atlas has been with the Ring Master even before the Carnival.\n\nAtlas was personally brought up by the Ring Master and is utterly loyal to him. It\u2019s commonly thought that the Ring Master found him abandoned as a baby and took him in, of course rumors also persist that he\u2019s the Ring Master\u2019s son. (Whether the Ring Master is the father OR the mother causes more rumors) Whatever the truth, Atlas might as well be his son as he certainly considers the Ring Master as a parental figure since he raised him.\n\nAtlas\u2019 sole job is to protect the Ring Master and to look intimidating. A job he does very well. Atlas rarely speaks and if he does it\u2019s usually a one word response in a low voice. Charley hopes Ajax will be his counter balance when the time comes, of course Ajax feels he\u2019ll be able to beat Atlas with no problems.\n\nAtlas is one of the few people that has no opinion of you, he just sees you as another Carney who works for the Ring Master and aren\u2019t allowed to see him unless he deems it so.\n\nMadam Orbec\n\nMadam Orbec is the gypsy fortune teller. Like most fortune tellers she claims to genuinely have psychic powers, but most likely she\u2019s just really good at conning people. Still she always keeps in character at all times, so it\u2019s possible she believes her own hype. One thing she does a lot is talk to \u201cspirits\u201d that aren\u2019t there. Sometimes this results in her talking to herself for great lengths of time and often screaming to tell \u201cthem\u201d to shut up. She doesn\u2019t even appear to notice anyone else around while she\u2019s doing this. All of which pretty much means most of the other Carneys consider her just mentally unstable and is listening to the voices in her own head.\n\nOddly Randal completely believes she has psychic abilities, this is probably due to Randal\u2019s own naivety and his own desperate belief that magic is real. He consults her frequently about what she sees in the future for the carnival, it\u2019s possible that\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t made any kind of move of his own because he\u2019s guided by her visions to a certain degree. Madam Orbec likes Randal, but remains suspicious if he isn\u2019t just trying to be friendly to gain access to an old book she has supposedly containing secrets to necromancy.\n\nBecause of this factor, unlike the Ring Master and Charley\u2019s \u201cright hand men\u201d, Madam Orbec isn\u2019t necessarily on Randal\u2019s side. She believes a great change is coming in the carnival, but the spirits haven\u2019t told her exactly what that is yet. Her visions and conversations have been increasing to the point where she can barely keep it together for the rubes anymore. Her sanity has been in severe question for years, but now her competency is as well.\n\nOf course she still has enough sense to not want to be near you. Apparently the spirits don\u2019t like you anymore than the living do.\n\nPervus the Clown\n\n\u201cPervert\u201d or \u201cPervo\u201d is what he\u2019s usually called and for good reason. Pervus is probably the next disgusting Carney after you, the only difference is he has a group of like minded \u201cfriends\u201d and the other thing is he\u2019s a clown. And clowns no matter how twisted and evil they are; they can get away with it.\n\nHe and his gang of equally demented red nosed fellows have to be the sickest bunch in the Carnival, particularly in the sex department. It\u2019s not surprising that townie children start disappearing whenever the Carnival makes an extended visit somewhere and they certainly haven\u2019t all run off to join, what ultimately happens to them is better left unmentioned and not dwelled upon too much. But it isn\u2019t just children that disappear. Local farm animals will disappear as well (Strangely these poor creatures may be spared death, if the Carnival is in need of a couple new pack animals) and local graveyards may even be raided\u2026\n\nOf course Pervus and the clowns think it\u2019s all a big joke on the rubes.\n\nDespite being the symbols of utter depravity, they are one of the other \u201cmajor groups\u201d and as is fitting they are a wild card. They do their job when its show time and do it very well which puts them in good standing with the Ring Master. They often indulge in the prostitutes and liquor Charley provides. And while Randal barely approves of them (To be honest he probably isn\u2019t aware of how bad they REALLY are) he does recognize them as having a talent and are an important staple of any carnival. (They also aren\u2019t Freaks, though classifying them as \u201cNormals\u201d might be stretching it) Its unknown who Pervus will side with, but they see that there\u2019s definitely benefits for any of them.\n\nPervus and his crew are the one exception concerning you. Instead of them avoiding you, YOU purposely avoid them! While they\u2019d never kill you (They do still follow that one rule that you don\u2019t kill a fellow Carney for no reason) that wouldn\u2019t prevent them from having their way with you if the urge ever struck them. You have been known to resemble a rotting dead body (In smell especially) when you\u2019re passed out after all.\n\nSasha and Salina\n\nSasha is the on/off girlfriend of Ajax. She\u2019s not only a contortionist, but also an acrobat. She\u2019s very beautiful, but her self-esteem isn\u2019t really the best otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be with Ajax. He pretty much treats her like shit, and she\u2019ll put up with it, until he really fucks up and then she throws him out of her trailer. Upon which time he\u2019ll continue to harass and stalk her until she takes him back for the umpteenth time and the cycle starts over again. She\u2019s definitely the star attraction of the \u201cnormal\u201d Carneys, besides Randal. (Who really wishes she wasn\u2019t so close to Ajax.)\n\nSalina is Charley\u2019s girlfriend\u2026or at least he likes to tell everyone she is. She\u2019s the tattooed woman and also dances with various kinds of snakes. (Imaginatively called a \u201cSnake Lady\u201d) She\u2019s pretty, but has a harder look than Sasha, its obvious by her demeanor she had a rough life before the Carnival. Charley is constantly hitting on her, but he\u2019s unsuccessful for the most part though every now and then he gets lucky, though you suspect it\u2019s his money talking more than his \u201ccharms\u201d at work in those cases. In any event she isn\u2019t particularly fond of him. She\u2019s considered a normal, but her activities and lifestyle lean more towards the criminal mindset particularly prostitution. So she has more in common with Charley than Randal who looks his nose down at her.\n\nProbably due to the partnership of Charley and Ajax, Sasha and Salina associate with each other more than they might normally would. As it turns out the two are genuinely friends and speak to each other frequently, one may wonder if they aren\u2019t plotting something on their own together\u2026\n\nOf course you\u2019d never know since the two of them avoid you like the plague because you\u2019re just icky.", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Cast of Characters (The Sideshows)", "result": "Normals\n\nNormals is really a generic term for anyone who isn\u2019t a Freak, but its often used to describe Carneys who aren\u2019t deformed in some way and make a living in the Carnival utilizing some skill. (\u201cNormals\u201d who aren\u2019t Carneys are usually just called \u201cRubes\u201d or at best \u201cTownies\u201d) The core of these include acrobats, tightrope walkers, game barkers and the like. Normals as always out number the Freaks, but they aren\u2019t nearly as unified, though Randal\u2019s been trying to, in his effort to gain power.\n\nNearly all Normals find you revolting and run you off if you get near, either verbally OR physically.\n\nFreaks\n\nThis is a generic term for Carneys who have some sort of genetic condition that separates them from the rest of society. They can range from being very hairy, have no limbs, or have a few extra ones. In any case they are one of the major carnival draws. Some learn a few skills to go along with their deformities, but it\u2019s mainly their horrific appearance that they rely upon. Despite all their different forms, they are very unified and support the Ring Master for giving them a place in the world. Jasmine the bearded lady tends to be the Matriarch of them all\n\nFreaks are a little more tolerant of you, since they\u2019ve also suffered scorn and ridicule too, but you\u2019re not REALLY one of them and as such you\u2019re still an outsider and aren\u2019t really welcomed around them.\n\nMidgets\n\nNot quite normals and not quite freaks, but the midgets are the ones who get things done in the Carnival and keep it running. (Though everyone else refers to them as Midgets, they prefer to refer to each other as Dwarves) They make up a majority of the labor force of the Carnival, a thankless job to be sure, and one that went unappreciated until Charley arrived. Now they make a lot more thanks to his \u201cextra curricular\u201d activities. They are pretty much unified, though they have mixed feelings about their self appointed leader.\n\nMidgets are overworked at the best of times, so when a smelly disgusting Geek like you is around they really don\u2019t have the tolerance or patience for it. Bob is about the only one who\u2019ll even talk to you, the rest tend to kick you in the shins and chase you off with their work tools while shouting obscenities.\n\nPinheads\n\nAn interesting sub-society within the Freak community. They all tend to hang out together constantly laughing and babbling nonsensical ramblings. Though they may appear childlike and carefree, those qualities can mask a mean spiritedness sometimes.\n\nYou\u2019d know since you\u2019ve experienced this meanness first hand.\n\nClowns\n\nPure evil wrapped up in the guise of something supposedly funny and harmless. While technically classified as \u201cnormals\u201d, there isn\u2019t anything normal about them. One wonders if they\u2019re actually even human underneath that make up.
