You do travel by the sewers though, and the going is easier when you get out of rat territory.\n\n\nYou come across all manner of freaks and beasts in the sewer systems, which span for miles and miles.  A few times you even get someone to guide your toward Lord Karstark's little territory. \n\n\nYour current guide, some Nuub named Lord Shark points up to a ladder.  Apparently these two Lords have been feuding for a while now, so of course he would be happy to help you! \n\n\nYou're about to make your way up when he holds up a hand.\n\n\n\"Hey, so this ladder should lead right into the middle of his camp, in a not so open place of course,\" Lord Shark says, \"but if you go a little more up that way, there should be a pipe that leads somewhere else in his camp.\"\n\n\nShark looks around before continuing.\n\n\n\"I can't say for sure where it goes but it couldn't hurt to check it out.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, \"I appreciate the assistance.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "ladder", "result": "You climb up the ladder, open the hatch, and find yourself smack in the middle of Karstark's camp just as you expected.

His nose buried in some a story by one, who goes by the name of queenlatifa04, with the lowest rated book, presumably about to be turned into toilet paper.\n\n\nYou send your tentacle forth, stabbing through the shitty (or soon to be shitty paper) and the tentacle slams right through his chest.  Karstark's mouth gapes and quivers.\n\n\n\"Y-y-you\u2026.I remember you\u2026\" Karstark says.\n\n\n\"I would assume so, you just turned me into a pie,\" you say.\n\n\n\"That was\u2026months ago\u2026\" Karstark says before is head droops down and shpfoooooooouuuutt his legs jerk upwards as his bowels empty.\n\n\nYou remove your bloody tentacle, admiring the sharp end on this one.  You didn't even know you could do that, must have been instinct.
