Abberline has actually put together a rather strong case on him: generally his apearrence tallies with various descriptions of the killer. Mary Kelly's room was locked from the inside, either the killer reached through the broken window next to the door to lock the door from the inside and took the key with him (a perfectly possible scenario) or Barnett used his own key to lock the door. Finally there were ginger beer bottles in Mary Kelly's room, in letters most likely to have been written by the Ripper he mentions keeping blood in ginger beer bottles.\n\n\nGeorge Hutchinson, one of the witnesses who saw a suspicious man with Mary Kelly came to Abberline's attention as his description of the man with her seemed a little too detailed and it seems strange that he followed the pair of them around for some time. Abberline suspects if Hutchinson was the real killer then this was a ruse to throw you off the scent.\n\n\nAlois Szemeredy is an interesting man you learn about in police records. Twelve years ago in Buenos Aires, Argentina a prostitute called Carolina Metz had her throat cut by an unknown man. Szemeredy, a notorious thief and certified lunatic, was arrested on suspicion of murder but eventually acquitted after a long and closely-fought trial. Afterwards he fled back to his native Hungary where he vanished again three years ago, Abberline has heard rumors that he may be in London now.\n\n\nFinally there is Dr Francis Tumblety. Tumblety is currently wanted by the London Police for \"committing indecent acts with other men\" (as Abberline diplomatically puts it). Tumblety has skipped bail and fled to France where he has booked passage on a ship back to his native America. Because Tumblety is an out-spoken woman-hater he is being tracked by Abberline's officers who want to question him in connection with the Ripper murders.\n\n\nYou will have to move fast as all of these suspects are constantly on the move and in the cases of Kelly and Szemeredy you are not even sure of their current locations.

They believed the Ripper was literally a foaming-at-the-mouth madman and because they were anti-Semitic they guessed he was probably Jewish too, hence \"the mad Jew\" theory that crops up in police documents like the Macnaghten Memorandum. Frederick Abberline was probably the best of a bad bunch while I think the later detective John Littlechild was on the right track too.\n\n\nSince the Victorian era literally hundreds of books have been written naming possible Ripper suspects. Though anyone who was in London and alive at the time could be a suspect I think there is something in believing that the Ripper could have been a known serial killer like George Chapman. Strong cases have been made for non-killers, books like Miriam Rivett's and Mark Whitehead's Jack the Ripper (naming suspect Joseph Barnett) and Donald Rumbelow's The Complete Jack the Ripper (naming suspect Francis Tumblety) particularly stand out.\n\n\nThough Tumblety is the most likely of all the suspects to my mind it's certain the mystery of who Jack the Ripper was will never be solved.
