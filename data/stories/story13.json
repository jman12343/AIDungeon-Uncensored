You\u2019ve had twelve miserable years in the world, an existence wracked with headaches, horrible, coma-like states known as your \u201cdeep dreams\u201d, and horrible, scratching and never-ceasing voices that knaw at your sanity. You\u2019ve been left frail, pale and very skinny from your condition as you spend most of your life sleeping, wrapped up and coddled in a tent of animal hides. If there was any justice, you would\u2019ve been left on a hill to die when your tribe realized how weak you were, but through your condition you\u2019ve made yourself useful. You have premonitions, messages that you can make out from the depth of your dreams that make you the most valuable member of the tribe. Whether it be seeing the green flames of anger running through the eastern fringes of the forests that signal an upcoming Greenkskin attack, the sweet smells drifting from the lake that indicate a herd of Braxen or a flock of buzzards that can easily be haunted down by some of your hunters. That\u2019s not even to mention some of your other abilities. You can unnerve, even frighten strong warriors with a glance, cause mass confusion with a few words, easily convince some of the dumber members of the tribe to do your bidding, and with a lot of effort you\u2019re able to \u201cdrag\u201d items towards you without touching them. Still, due to the fact you can barely walk, it\u2019s hardly a fair trade off.\n\n\n\u201cKarth!\u201d a voice cries. \n\n\nYou look up, pulling your skinny body slightly above the blankets that are wrapped around you to look at Duggin as he walks inside, carrying a spear, a bow and sheath, wearing the hide of one of the many beasts of the jungle.\n\n\n\u201cWhat thoughts have you for us today?\u201d Duggin asks.\n\n\nYou love your tribe. Your tribe is a group of strong, brave and loyal men who only want the best for each other. Better men don\u2019t exist. Unfortunately, they\u2019re idiots. Half your job here is relaying the many dreams, omens and messages you have in your sleep. The other half is keeping them from killing themselves. There are men here who have lived twenty, thirty, forty, even fifty years, but in your twelve years on this world you\u2019ve learned infinitely more. You introduced them to the concept of stealing the hides from slain beasts and wearing it as your own, the concept of hiding like a predator with camouflage and strength, and new battlefield strategies beyond \u201cattack!\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cNone. It was a peaceful night,\u201d you say.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a hunt with the Azajaja tribe. We\u2019re heading to meet up with them soon.\u201d\n\n\nYou nod, raising your bony arms as Duggin lifts you up. You wrap your frail body around him as he walks outside. A large boar-like creature, a puk, sits there with a double-saddle tied to it. Duggin sits in the front saddle and places you in the back one, wrapping blankets tightly around you. You need the blankets for multiple reasons: to keep warm, to give yourself some sort of cushion to protect your fragile body, and most importantly it stops from having to feel the rough puk hair. Many textures, just like puk hair, just sends you into a tantrum for some strange reason. You can't rationalize it, but it still effects you. The puk begins striding forward in a half-gallop, as the other hunters of your tribe hop astride the puk, heading out toward the nearby lake. Suddenly, you watch as dozens of lizard-like creatures burst out of the trees, scuttling away from the jungles.\n\n\n\u201cAh! Look what we have here, boys! Fresh prey, sent to us by the great God-Emperor!\u201d Duggin yells, raising his bow.\n\n\nYou watch as the lizards charge out with reckless abandon, straight into your arrow fire. You pull yourself up the saddle into more of a sitting position, thinking. These are simple beasts, but even beasts have a level of cunning that stops them from acting as such. They aren\u2019t this stupid, are they?", "action_results": [{"action": "Warn your allies", "result": "These beasts would never simply charge into the path of a fierce predator\u2026 unless a fiercer predator was chasing them.\n\n\n\u201cWait! Wait! Attack!\u201d you shout.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Duggin asks, annoyed as your outburst causes him to miss a shot.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something chasing the beasts!\u201d\n\n\nDuggin raises an eyebrow, before barking out an order. The hunters quickly rearrange formation, just as a horde of Greenskins charge out of the trees with a fierce roar. A burst of spears and arrows flies out from your allies, but the orks take them in their stride. Arrows imbed themselves into their chest and arms, but they don\u2019t go down. Spears jab forward, metal points finding the softest parts of the thick green skin, sinking deep with a spurt of blood. There\u2019s about two dozen, as many as you, but they can take more punishment. You\u2019re outnumbered, but thanks to your forethought and your tiny amount of preparation, you have a chance. You still find yourself useless in the upcoming battle, but it lasts only a few minutes. You watch as blood is shed, limbs are hacked off and puk are struck down. You use what little might you have to cling onto the puk, only barely stopping yourself from falling off. You close your eyes, and wait. Eventually, Duggin calls you.\n\n\n\u201cKarth! It\u2019s over!\u201d he says.\n\n\nYou open your eyes, and survey the carnage. Bodies litter the earth, green and tan, lean and muscled, big and small. You\u2019ve lost half your hunters in a single attack, but the rest of you have survived with few wounds. When orks strikes land, they kill, not wound. \n\n\n\u201cMen, we need to check on the Azajaja boys!\u201d Duggin yells. \n\n\nHe rides forward, towards the Azajaja camp, deep in the trees. You cling to the puk, looking through the trees as you approach their camp. It\u2019s in ruins. Tents have been torn apart, set alight and entirely wiped out. Bodies cover the ground, and you see the last few remnants of the Azajaja struggling to fight off the approaching Orks. Most are naked, still refusing to pick up your tactic of not going into battle with their dicks flapping in the breeze or their breasts hanging, as well as being one of the more idiotic tribes not to take on clothing at all, unlike yours.\n\n\n\u201cIdiots,\u201d you mutter to yourself.\n\n\nDuggin raises his spear and charges forward, the puk bursting forward as you struggle to hold on. Why couldn\u2019t the idiot have left you at home?! Your allies attack with rage and speed, smashing into the orks from behind. There\u2019s a short, brutal fight, before you see an ork charging towards you, swinging his axe.\n\n\n\u201cDuggin!\u201d you yell, pointing at the ork. \n\n\nDuggin turns, but he\u2019s not fast enough. The ork\u2019s weapon smashes into your puk, cutting through flesh and beheading him in a single blow. You\u2019re sent flying as the puk collapses suddenly, smashing into the cold earth. You let out a pained yell, before opening your hazy eyes, only to find yourself in the centre of the remaining Azajaja survivors, which only consist of half a dozen warriors, a number that\u2019s constantly dropping as the Orks charge once more, as well as two dozen civilians hastily armed with weapons. Suddenly, a small, goblin-like creature, a Gretchen, scampers through the warriors\u2019 line, carrying a small knife fashioned from a large stone, who lets out a chuckle as he spots you and lets out a terrifying grin.

The relief is short-lived, though, as the orks continue to charge forward, swinging hastily-made weapons. The number of Azajaja survivors grows much smaller, as your tribesmen attempt to rescue both them and you whilst surviving the onslaught of Greenskin, but there\u2019s just too many. Hands grab your shoulders and pull you up, just out of the path of an oncoming spear. You turn, to see the face of a young girl, barely older than you, holding a spear with a terrified look on her face. You blush as you realize she\u2019s naked, before chiding yourself for having such an immature thought while people are charging to kill you.

You let out a terrified, ear-piercing scream. In one outburst of air, you release all your pent-up terror and fear. The ork lets out a pained howl, clutching its ears. It continues screaming, collapsing to its knees, before its head explodes in a spray of crimson mist. You watch as dozens of orks collapse to the ground, blood streaming from their eyes, ears, nose and mouth.

You notice the girl from earlier sitting in the corner, scaled hides and furs wrapped around her with her head resting on the handle of the sword she\u2019s clutching. She notices your wandering eyes and begins staring at you with her bright, green eyes. She's covered in dirt, with her brown hair hacked as short as yours, making her look like a boy.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d you reply, staring back at her, wondering why she\u2019s keeping herself from blinking.\n\n\n\u201cYou sleep a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\nYou sit there staring at each for quite some time, before the tent flap opens as Duggin walks inside. You notice several fresh scars across his chest, and a long one across his face.\n\n\n\u201cKarth! You\u2019re awake!\u201d he says with surprise. \n\n\n\u201cHow long was I dreaming?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cTwo weeks. We thought\u2026 after what happened\u2026 Well, we considered feeding you to the puk,\u201d Duggin chuckles. \u201cGood to see you\u2019re alive. What visions have you had?\u201d\n\n\nYou reflect briefly on your dreams.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s heavy storms coming within a weak, heavy amounts prey south towards the coast of the lake\u2026 and no sign of Greenskin activity,\u201d you say.\n\n\n\u201cGood to know, little one. I\u2019ll pass the message on.\u201d\n\n\nDuggin turns his attention to the girl, who sits there.\n\n\n\u201cHave you met the Azajaja, Karth?\u201d he asks. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t said a word the entire time she was here. She just sat there. It took a fierce bit of effort to get her to eat. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s just been shitting in the corner.\u201d\n\n\nDuggin looks to the girl, seemingly expecting her to say something, but she says nothing, just stares at you.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 grab you some food and drink. For both of you,\u201d Duggin says, walking out of the tent, leaving you and the girl alone.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Karth,\u201d you reply, offering your hand to shake.\n\n\nShe just sits there in response, staring at you. It\u2019s getting unnerving. After a few minutes, Duggin returns, carrying two wooden bowls of cooked meats as well as two more of wine. He leaves them on the floor in front of you.\n\n\n\u201cMake sure she eats. I\u2019ll give you some time, but then we need to discuss how you wiped out two dozens orks with\u2026 whatever powers you\u2019ve been blessed with,\u201d he says, before leaving.\n\n\nYou grab the two bowls of meat, sliding one across the floor to her. You begin eating, as she does the same. She grabs the meat and stuffs it into her mouth, all without breaking eye contact or letting go of her sword. She eats the meat with her mouth open, making loud chewing noises. You wince at the noise, the churning, slicing and crushing being another thing your mind is repulsed by. You blink, unnerved by the staring, but begin to eat, the delicious taste of flesh filling your mouth.\n\n\n\u201cYou snore loudly,\u201d she says after several minutes.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been told,\u201d you reply.\n\n\n\"What do you do?\" she asks.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you do all day?

She walks forward, turning and bending over to allow you to wrap your arms around her shoulders and then lift yourself up enough to wrap your legs around her thighs. She stands with a grunt, grabbing her sword before walking forward and out of the tent. You look up at the quickly falling sun, basking your face in its warmth. The rest of the tribe gives you a quick glance, surprised to see you outside, but go back to work. The girl continues to carry you around, trotting along the tents towards the trees.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 do I get to know your name?\u201d you ask. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Fay,\u201d she replies.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Karth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you dream of?

You spot the sun finally descending under the horizon, as the darkness stretches over the sky. Two duller bright lights take its place, but they\u2019re far too weak to give even an ounce of its brightness. \n\n\n\u201cWe should go back,\u201d you say.\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Fay asks.\n\n\n\u201cMonsters dwell here at night.\u201d\n\n\nShe pats her sword gently.\n\n\n\u201cI have a blade.

Fay becomes a constant companion, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the other children of the tribe would be happy to play with her and devoting all her time to you. You\u2019re not sure why, but you\u2019re grateful for it. Puberty changes both of you. Fay grows significantly taller, faster and stronger, growing from a small girl to a large and powerful warrior. She stands as tall and proud as the boys of the village, and is more than happy to face them off in a wrestling match, winning all of them. She seems to prefer spending her time hunting with the boys or more often with you than learning the common girl's chores of cooking, sewing and cleaning. You'd imagine soon enough she'll have to find a husband among the hunters.\n\n\nThankfully, growth does not leave you behind, although it doesn\u2019t effect you nearly as much. You grow strong enough to be able to stand and stroll around the camp, even taking small trips, although even a light jog for a minute or two is enough to topple you over with exhaustion. Compared to Fay, you're a twig whilst her muscled form is that of an thick tree trunk. Puberty also has a significant change on your abilities. You sleep less, although your dreams are harsher, and there\u2019s more\u2026 anger behind them. The monsters seem aware of you know, there voices constantly breaking into reality and continuing to scream and plead with you. You simply refuse to listen, and with training, you can make them become something of a white noise to your day to day activity. Your powers also increase. With the flick of your fingers, you can start a small fire. With a word, you can leave anything, man or beast, confused and befuddled. You can pick things up and throw them with a strength unfound to you, beating out many of the warriors in throwing contests without even moving. The world as a whole changes as well.

This time, though, one pierces through, louder than ever before, almost as if someone is whispering directly in your ear.\n\n\n\u201cKarth\u2026 Karth\u2026 I can help you\u2026 I have so much power\u2026 I have so much strength\u2026 all of it, I\u2019m happy to offer you\u2026\u201d\n\n\nYou feel the claws of a million voices scratching at your mind.

Several large, metal buildings sit there in the fields next to the tents. Men holding large spears march around the camp, directing throngs of tribespeople towards the buildings. These spears seem to be capable of firing arrows made of concentrated sunlight. Interesting. You notice several giants, seemingly made of metal, standing on the edge of the camp, watching the work. Suddenly, you find yourself yanked into the air by invisible hands, and float into the air, suspended two four feet above the ground. You watch as a trio of men approach you, smiling. The one on the left is a giant, seemingly made entirely of metal. He stands at around eight feet, with dozens spikes protruding from his metal skin. His body\u2019s black, with a purple head. In the middle, a tall, pale man wearing a long, black leather overcoat, a spiked collar strapped around his neck. The third seems to be a hybrid between a girl and a metal monster, her eyes replaced by the three red, unblinking eyes of a monster, a dozen long, metal arms extending from the nape of her back, three arms ending in claws and one a drill, with her legs replaced by four spider-like legs. Where her human arms would be extends a grasping, whirring claw and a metal barrel, the inside of which glows faintly blue. The middle one walks forward with a smile.\n\n\n\u201cHello there, young Karth. Pleasure to see you,\u201d he smiles jovially.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for pleasantries, psyker,\u201d the metal man says. \u201cLoad him onto the ship!\n\n\n\"Give him time to adjust! He's only just waking up,\" the man, the psyker, says.\n\n\nOne of the long, metal arms attached to the monster-man's back goes towards you, whirring its drill. It cuts along your arm, drawing a long, thin cut as you yelp in pain.\n\n\n\"This one is weak... how pitiful,\" the monster-man says. \"It's pain tolerance is low, but I can work with it.\"\n\n\n\"I want to use his mind, not his flesh,\" the psyker says. \"My name is Kyros. The burly armored man to my right is Chapter Master Taj Suenage, and the robotic companion to my left is the Heretek known as the Craftsman of Vorn, the Butcher of Karis IV and the Father to the Prometheans. Her name is Magos Cern. We are the Forces of Chaos.\"\n\n\nThe monster-man extends one of her metal tentacle arms once more, tracing the outline of your cheek bones.\n\n\n\"Bah! Time wastes! Either give me the surge of the warp overtaking me, or give me the surge of battle, Kyros!\" Taj roars, smacking a metal hand against his chest.\n\n\n\"As you wish, Taj,\" the Psyker says. \n\n\nThe Psyker claps his hands, and his various forces begin forcing the last of the tribespeople inside the building, as those who litter the floor, those who presumably tried to resist, are carried there.\n\n\n\"Are they dead?\"\n\n\n\"Some, presumably. I gave the order to keep as many alive as possible,\" Kyros says.\n\n\nYou see Fay's battered and bruised body being tossed over a metal giant's shoulder as she's carried off towards the building.\n\n\n\"No! Give her back!\" you shout.\n\n\n\"She fought well. When my men entered this pathetic village, she was trying to warn them. She even tried to fight them off. Killed one of the dumber ones who tried to call her bluff. Commendable.\"\n\n\nYou furrow your brow, and the Psyker grins as Taj's head is knocked slightly back, before presuming position. Despite how little you've harmed him, the metal giant seems enraged.\n\n\n\"You scum-sucking sociopathic cunt!\" Taj roars, charging forward.\n\n\nTaj is flipped into the air, being suspended just out of reach of you. His metal fists swing at you, but he's kept out of grasp.\n\n\n\"Tut tut. Stay your anger, my dear Taj. Karth, I'll make you a deal. Do as I say, and the girl will be unharmed. Deal?", "action_results": [{"action": "Agree", "result": "\"OK. Just don't hurt her,\" you say.\n\n\nYou drop, hitting the floor quite gently. Kyros grins and gives you a nod.\n\n\n\"Good boy.

I'll give your bitch whore \"special care\"!\" Taj roars, still grabbing at you.\n\n\nKyros rolls her eyes, flipping Taj into the dust.\n\n\n\"Quiet now, marine,\" he says. \"I have a gift to sate your bloodlust. Bring out the chieftain!\"\n\n\nYou watch as Duggin is dragged form his tent, growling and yelling. A large cut goes down his chest, blood having soaked his armor, turning it a deep crimson that shines in the sun. \n\n\n\"Come on, finish me!\" he roars.\n\n\n\"I don't want to see my men die, Karth. I gave your chieftain the option to surrender, give me his finest warriors... and you, of course, and I'd spare his civilians. He refused, killed some of my men, had his warriors killed and now I have to take you all. Now, he will die. This is what happens when people mess with my plans, Karth.\"\n\n\nTaj drops to the ground, turning to stare at Duggin with a monstrous laugh.\n\n\n\"Fortunately, Karth, I won't make you watch. You have agreed, haven't you?\" Kyros says with a wink. \n\n\nYou're released to the ground, and Kyros and Magos Cern walk alongside you towards the metal buildings. You walk inside, and the doors shut. A bright red light, like a very powerful candle, appears out of nothingness, brightening the room. The tribespeople are packed in here, surrounded by a tight bundle of guards with spears raised.\n\n\n\"What happens here? There's no space to do anything,\" you say.\n\n\n\"It's a landing craft, little one. Now, we soar to the stars,\" Kyros says.\n\n\nYou see several feet away from you is Fay's crumpled form and feel a twinge of pain. You sit down in the metal building as it begins to shake and shudder as if moving, terrified of the world around you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Four Hours Later...", "result": "The trip is long. The landing craft constantly shakes and shudders, and quickly fills with the smell of puke as the stomachs of many of the men and women around you as they fail to handle the constant shaking.

Please file out and follow the guards towards your cells.\"\n\n\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" someone asks.\n\n\n\"I'm going to make you matter in a galaxy that stands for no one,\" Kyros says proudly.\n\n\nThe people begin being shuffled off the landing raft, and you find yourself in a massive metal room. You look out a massive opening, filled with similar craft. You look around, before a metal hand grabs your shoulder.\n\n\n\"Stay,\" Taj growls. \"You're not to be mixed in with these common curs.\"\n\n\n\"What's going to happen to them?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Some will live. Most will die. All will suffer,\" Taj says.\n\n\n\"What... what are you?\"\n\n\n\"A space marine, boy,\" Taj says.\n\n\nHe grabs his head, twisting it. His metal head is yanked off, revealing a scarred human head underneath.\n\n\n\"You're a human.\"\n\n\n\"Practically. Did you think I was metal through and through?\" Taj asks.\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"It's armor, boy,\" Taj says. \"I don't have time to explain shit to you.\"\n\n\nKyros marches out, raising you into the air.\n\n\n\"Come on, boy. Let's go!\" Kyros says eagerly, walking along the ship.\n\n\nYou float after him, being dragged through the air, unable to resist. After a few minutes, you fall to your knees in front of a metal door.\n\n\n\"I've asked what's going to happen to us. You still haven't given me an answer,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You've found yourself in a war, little one. Your planet is worth jack shit. Everything you know doesn't matter. This war encompasses the galaxy.Systems burn, billions die, the fate of trillions is fought for.\"\n\n\n\"War? Whose fighting?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Everyone. The world has monsters so powerful that they'd wipe out every warrior in all your tribes in an instant. There's the Tyranids, a horrible bug hive-mind with nothing but a need to eat. There's the Necrons, an ancient of soulless machines that have only just began to awaken. There's the Orks, a warring species of monsters, the Eldar, an enigmatic species just as likely to help as hinder you, Then, you have the worst villains. The Imperium of Man. They're freedom-crushing, innovation-stopping, potential-destroying fascists who enslave trillions and worship a corpse. We stand against them. We serve the Dark Gods. Khorne the Warrior God, Tzeentch the Sorcery God, Slaaneesh the Pleasure God and Nurgle the Plague God. We fight to free ourselves from tyranny, to make sure every man is free. We offer gifts of strength, knowledge, joy and immortality, yet the Imperium spurns us. So we rebelled. We are the Forces of Chaos, who fight back against tyranny! Praise Chaos in all it's glory!\"\n\n\n\"I'm still waiting for an answer,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We're going to turn you into super-soldiers. Magos Cern has long worked on the process. We're going to make you greater than Space Marines. You hold the most potential. Cern can play with their flesh and Taj can train them, but I offer the greatest gift: Ultimate power. You're gifted, Karth. I want to use that gift to make you one of the most powerful beings known to man.\"\n\n\nYou stare at him nervously. You're not an idiot. People don't just create powerful soldiers without having a chain around them. You watch as Kyros takes a steel, studded collar and walks towards you. He wraps it around your throat, clicking it into place. \n\n\n\"Is that comfortable?\" Kyros asks.\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" you see, scratching at the collar.\n\n\n\"At any moment, I can shut down your powers and strangle the very air out of your throat. So play nice.\"\n\n\nKyros picks you up again with a flick of the wrist and you float upwards. Kyros carries you through the air, stopping at another door. It opens with being touched, and Kyros drops you inside it.\n\n\n\"This is your cell. I've made it... comfortable. In return, you best be... compliant I need to... check on some things. Wait here for the time being,\" Kyros says, sealing the door behind you.\"\n\n\nYou stand up, looking around the room.

Leave none alive!\"\n\n\nThe first gate opens, and you freeze as you see a group of a dozen shambling mutant abominations walking forward. You can tell they were once human, but now you can barely tell. Tentacles, extra limbs, massive tumors, animal parts and much worse. There's barely a human intelligence left behind their eyes, replaced by an animal-like instinct.

Needless to say, it doesn't take much more to fully finish off the mutant pack, leaving them all dead.\n\n\n\"Alright!\" Kyros yells cheerfully. \"Now, anyone can strike down some animalistic mutants. Now, let's see how the gladiator-slaves fare!\"\n\n\nYou watch as another gate opens, and half a dozen semi-armored humans walk out, holding swords, spears, halbeards, axes and all hold shields. Thankfully, they've no long-range weapons, so you have a fairly good chance. With that, they begin to advance. They're in a solid formation, bundled together to stop you from picking them off one, shields raised in an attempt to mimic a shelled creature.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fire a burst of flames at them", "result": "You raise your hand, firing a stream of fire that manifests in your palm and gushes out towards your foes.

Perhaps we should give him a break,\" Kyros says, before laughing cheerfully. \"Or perhaps... we should give him a real challenge. Bring out the Champion of Davial!\"\n\n\nThe final gate, the one behind you, opens. You spin around on the balls of your feet, prepared to kill, even through you're exhausted. You can here your psychic defenses begin to falter as the voices come back, thousands of voices screaming, laughing and howling in your mind. Physically, you're tired from this heavy exercise, and just want to pass out. You watch in terror as a massive figure clad in huge plates of armor walks forward. Two sharpened tusks come out from his helmet, and in one hand he holds a massive warhammer, while in the other, attached to his arm, is a bolter. By either side of the massive Champion is a nearly naked slave wearing rags, trying to polish the armor while the Champion of Davial continues walking forward.\n\n\n\"Begin!\" Kyros shouts.\n\n\nSuddenly, you hear another familiar voice.\n\n\n\"Hello, my dear Karth. I see you're outgunned here. Need some help?\" Meliodas asks.\n\n\nThe Champion raises his bolter and it fires. You quickly form a shield, barely absorbing the massive amount of power behind the bolter. \n\n\n\"I can help you, but you're going to need to get your hands dirty. See those two slaves? Go for them. Boil their bloods with your mind, and help draw the psychic beings that are trying to enter.\"\n\n\n\"What?\" you ask aloud, teleporting out of the way of another burst of bolter fire as the Champion of Davial continues to advance.\n\n\n\"Kill the slaves. I'll offer their souls as a... summoning gift to two potential allies for you.\"\n\n\nThis presents a moral dilemma. Can you wipe out the two slaves in order to win this battle? Can you even trust Meliodas? You do have other options. Through teleportation and levitation, you can easily evade the Champion, and you can wait to tire him out. You can attempt to wear down the Champion's armor through fire and psychic bolts. You can also attempt to teleport atop the Champion and try use your psychic powers to tear this bastard's head off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill the slaves for Meliodas", "result": "You nod, raising your hands and directing a blast of powerful psychic flames towards both slaves.

They're humanoid, half beautiful women and half horrifying crab-monster. Their face are stretched and gaunt, like once beautiful women whose faces melted, with long black hair, pale skin changing to black shell in patches over their bodies and a massive claw having replaced their right arm. They eagerly turn to the Champion of Delial, charging forward. They bounce, picing and attacking and cutting through metal with their powers.

You're lying on a metal table, completely naked, while Magos Cern stands nearby, drilling holes through a large blob of meat on another table.\n\n\n\"Ah, the good Techpriest is looking after you.

Your guards give you no chance to even think about escape, let alone actually making an attempt at it. You practice fighting in the arena everyday, facing hordes of mutants, failed attempts at creating super-soldiers, thankfully none of them from your tribe and a few slaves thrown in there for you to kill. Kyros is prone to sending out enemies that can cause painful wounds such as those that utilize painful poisons and toxins. It seems he's still bitter about the fact you tried to murder him. Understandable. After that, you have meditation, to calm the storms of your mind and give you a chance to keep the demons, and more literally daemons, at bay.\n\n\nYou spend time with Kyros as he attempts to indoctrinate you to serve him willingly, although after your attempt at his life this time mainly serves as a time to check on the wards for your collar and make sure you haven't circumvented them. You give him the idea that you're buying it, but you know he's just a madman. His ultimate goal seems to be regrouping with several other Chaos war-bands of various sizes to topple the Imperium of Man and take Terra, although the whisperings from other men tell you that that is an impossible goal.You're still not allowed to see Fay or anyone else com your tribe. You shudder at the thoughts of what Kyros is doing with them. For all his friendly gestures, kind deeds and grand ideals and plans, Kyros is but a corrupted mad man who is willing to sacrifice anyone and everyone in an attempt to gain power.\n\n\nUnder the Magos' orders, you've spent a lot of time sleeping from either the fatigue of constant fighting and training to expand your mind and permanently trying to ward off the daemons that scratch at your mind, or from various drugs and chems to put you under. Sleeping is painful, for the most part. You get a few brief bit of oblivion, which is a peace incomparable to anything you've ever had to deal with, but these states still being you deeper into your mind and the theWarp. Then the nightmares start. In the waking world, you have classes with the teachers. Kyros teaches you meditation techniques for controlling your powers as well as new ways to utilise the psychic energy flowing through your mind. Taj teaches you military tactics and how to lead everything from a small unit of hardened men to a massive army of garrisoned troops. Magos Cern teaches you a bit about mechanics, the various technologies of the galaxy and gives you a broad, general education about the galaxy and its inhabitants.\n\n\nOne day, you lie in bed, having emerged from the state of horrified dreaming but not yet having fully awoken, in a blissful, thoughtless state. The door opens, as two of your space marine guards enter. One uses a small device to make your collar tighten quickly before releasing again, a small threat to make sure you know whose boss. The fucking collar. You could turn him into a thick pink mist inside that armor if the collar wasn't stifling your abilities. \n\n\n\"What?\" you ask, annoyed to have been disturbed from your bliss.\n\n\n\"Kyros wants you,\" one says.\n\n\n\"What does he want?\"\n\n\nKyros appears in the room, leaning against the doorway, seemingly manifested out of thin air.\n\n\n\"Come on, let's go,\" he says nonchalantly, picking his nails.\n\n\n\"Where?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Well, as a... reward for your long week of work, I have a surprise. We're going to go see Fay.\"\n\n\n\"Really?\" you ask.\n\n\nA surge of emotions rising up inside you. Joy at the thought of seeing your friend, surprise at Kyros' kindness, gratitude for the gift, fear at what could've happened Fay, all these manifest into an overwhelming feeling of both exhilaration and dread.\n\n\n\"Well?

You're at a point where your psychic growth has overtaken your physical growth to such a degree that it'd be easier to float along the ground rather than actually having to walk. Unfortunately, the collar prevents you from even firing out some sparks without Kyros' permission. You arrive in a metal door, which opens, revealing the booth from which Kyros and the others watch down at the fight. You walk along, looking down at the arena, which is empty.\n\n\n\"I thought you were bringing me to see Fay,\" you say nervously, despite knowing what this is.\n\n\n\"I brought you to see her fight!\" Kyros says with a smile.\n\n\nYou stare down, as one of the gates opens. You watch as an abomination stumbles out. Stumbling on four insect-like legs, with it's eft arm replaced by a long tentacle of coiled pink muscle, the very end of it studded with bone outgrowths to make it a more formidable weapon. In it's right hand is a short, rusted axe stained with blood and gore. It's head is monstrous, with an oversized mouth filled to the brim with teeth, overflowing with acid that drips onto it's chest with a sizzle, and a single, blood-shot eye. The creature looks up at you, it's eye flinching, before it lets out a miserable howl.\n\n\n\"Shit... that looks miserable beyond belief,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Yes, she does,\" Kyros says, grinning from ear to ear as half a dozen more beasts just like the first walk, stumble or crawl into the center of the arena. \n\n\n\"She?\" you ask.\n\n\nNow that you're not fighting them, you can have a long look and see what these mutant abominations really are: disgusting, pitiful creatures that should receive a quick death.\n\n\n\"You don't recognize her?\" Kyros says, clearly suppressing laughter. \"This is what remains of the Uwais Tribe, and the first one to come out, the pack leader, is Fay.\"\n\n\nYou look at monsters underneath, trying to see any resemblance to your friends as pure horror overtakes your mind. You collapse to your knees, puking over the banister and onto the monsters underneath as Kyros bursts into laughter.\n\n\n\"He's done this to provoke you. He wants to get you angry, to see how powerful you are even with the collar. He's under-exaggerating how powerful you are, so you might be able to harm him, but...\" Meliodas advises, but you don't pay any attention, too filled with anger.\n\n\nYou stand, holding onto the banister to pull yourself up. Your knees shake, but you take a moment to regain your strength. Then, you launch yourself at Kyros. You grab at his eyes, your fingers going straight for his eyes. Kyros stumbles backwards, unprepared, before you feel your collar quickly tightening as you start to choke. You continue to scratch and gouge, even as the air is choked from you. Finally, you're dragged upwards by invisible hands, floating a few feet away from Kyros. Your weak body has done practically no damage to Kyros, who seems surprised and a bit amused rather than angry.\n\n\n\"Hmmm... I under-exaggerated how angry you'd get, or how stupid you are if you think trying to fight me is an option.\"\n\n\n\"I'm going to kill you. I'm going to break you. I don't care how long it takes, I will destroy your very soul,\" you say, staring at him.\n\n\nKyros chuckles softly, before forcing you around to stare down at the arena.\n\n\n\"Watch the match,\" he says.\n\n\n\"We will have our revenge, Karth. Not today, not tomorrow, but we will have our revenge, \" Meliodas says.\n\n\nYou watch for about a minute as the abominations sit there, wandering around in confusion, falling to brief bursts of violence and self-harm and a lot of screaming and howling. Finally, the second gate opens. You watch as hooded figures enter, holding swords and small, circular shields. The trio charges forward, diving into the air. The beasts charge forward, attacking with fierce brutality. You watch as the lead one, the thing that used to be Fay, is almost beheaded by one of the trio. The trio fight with ease, diving, ducking and weaving out of the way of tentacles, axes, biting and stomping. Within a minute, the last of the abominations stumble forward and hits the ground as its front two legs are hacked off, and one of the trio leaps on top of the monster and impales it through the head.\n\n\n\"What a display!\" Kyros says with a smile. \"Shall we see the victors?\"\n\n\nBefore you can say a word, Kyros releases you and you fall through the air, smacking into the dirt with a pained yelp. You moan in pain, looking up at the fighters. They walk forward, staring at you.\n\n\n\"Karth?\" one of them asks.\n\n\nYou look up to see Fay standing there, her hooded robes covered in blood, alongside two other Uwais tribals you vaguely remember from your trips accompanying hunting parties, the Jakar Twins.\n\n\n\"Fay,\" you reply, staring back at her, not knowing what else to say.\n\n\nFay tosses her sword aside, grabbing you and embracing you tightly. Even though you feel yourself being turned into a fine powder from the strength of her hug, you're just so happy that you've found her that you don't care, hugging back. Kyros drops down, staring at you from over Fay's shoulder, as Magos Cern joins you.\n\n\n\"Ah, what a happy reunion!\" Kyros says.\n\n\n\"You said she was dead!\" you shout angrily, pushing Fay aside to point an accusatory finger at him.\n\n\n\"I did. I lied,\" Kyros says, smiling.\n\n\n\"Never trust a psyker, Karth. Not even yourself,\" Meliodas says.\n\n\nYou shrug it off, trying not to bow to his attempts at emotional manipulation. You grab Fay, looking at her properly as she takes off her hooded cloak. She's tall, standing over six foot tall, and she's a lot more muscular than you remember. Whatever Kyros has done to her, it's had a serious affect. Her arms and legs are quite muscled, and you doubt you could find an ounce of fat anywhere on her. Still, she has the same coy smile, the wild, adventurous look in her eyes, She's pretty much the same Fay.\n\n\n\"So... what's with the hood?\" you ask, struggling to find anything else to say.\n\n\n\"Um... it's so the mutants can't grab my hair and drag me down, Karth. Was that the most important question? How are you? What are they doing to you?\"\n\n\n\"Come on, out of the arena. I have a captured Squig the boys want to have some fun fighting,\" Kyros says. \"Jakar twins, back to the dorm. Karth, Fay, follow me.\"\n\n\nYou look at Fay, before grabbing her hand and walking after Kyros and Magos Cern.\n\n\n\"Hmm, walking alongside me with my hand held? Where's the old Karth that I would piggyback around the village?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Pffh, if I didn't have this collar I'd be floating around the place,\" you say.\n\n\nThe stress of being kidnapped, having your tribe enslaved and murdered, your village burned down, your mind and soul forced through the very depths of hell falls away as you talk to your old friend. You recount your story as she tells hers. Apparently, she spent much of the time in a coma, having her body hacked apart and remade. Her blood now contains vast amounts of chems and combat drugs, she has several new organs and stronger bones, faster blood clotting and much more. She's trained extensively both with swords, guns, explosives and infinitely more, as well as team tactics. She's been chosen out as Team Leader for the Uwais super-soldiers.\n\n\n\"So basically, you've become a super-soldier?\"\n\n\n\"Super-soldier?\" Magos Cern says, her voice flooded with the most emotion you've heard from her the entire time you knew her. \"She's a failure. A disgrace. I had access to geneseed, space marine test subjects and untold resources. What did I create? A mockery. These \"super-soldiers\" couldn't take on multiple space marines each like I had hoped. They couldn't take on a single fucking space marine like I had planned! They're barely worth half a space marine! I've failed!\"\n\n\n\"They'll do fine, Magos,\" Kyros says, arriving at another set of metal doors, which open to reveal a large table, where various figures are sitting.\n\n\nThere's Kyros, Magos Cern and Taj Suenage, as well as Kyros' daughter, who sits in the corner. There's also many more who you don't know. One is a tall, gaunt looking woman with pale skin and black hair pulled back in a pony tail, wearing a long coat that disturbingly, appears to be made from human skin. Another is a girl with a shaved head wearing heavy combat armor who is sharpening a long machete, another is a... person whose gender you can't tell, wearing black leather armor and lingerie in an odd attempt to look sexy at a war meeting, with long, curly black hair and excessive make-up. The person smiles at you, licking his... or her... or its lips. Then there's a young girl, younger than even you, wearing hooded robes and reading an ancient, dusty tome. Finally, there's a barely human monster. An obese man covered with rotting pores, boils, sores and pus-filled, infected wounds, with its arms replaced by long, rusted spikes. Kyros and Magos Cern take a seat.\n\n\n\"These are the leaders of the fleet, Fay and Karth. Some introductions are in order. First is me, the supreme leader of the entire fleet. Magos Cern leads the Dark Mechanicus on the ship and maintains the vessel itself. Chapter Master Taj Suenage leads the space marine chapter on board, the Undying Reapers. Then we have Calpurnia the Ravager, leader of the 22nd Istanford Regiment. \"\n\n\nThe one with the human skin coat stands up, extending a hand to shake.\n\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you,\" she says, shaking both your hand and Fay's. I hope you're... efficient during your stay here.\"\n\n\n\"Then there's the Staine siblings. There's Rebecca Staine, the leader of the Bloody Claws, a war-band that worships Khorne the war god.\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you, psyker. You're weak and pathetic. Your parents should've left you to die,\" Rebecca growls, pointing her blade at you.\n\n\n\"Fuck you,\" Fay snarls, shoving her blade point away from your throat.\n\n\nRebecca stands, brandishing her sword, before the plague-ridden man stands, blocking Rebecca's path forward with one of his spike arms. \n\n\n\"Hey, hey! There's no need for violence! We're all brothers and sisters here!\"\n\n\nRebecca sits back down with another growl.\n\n\n\"Alright, next we have Elios, leading of the Shrieking Harpies, a war-band that worships Slaanesh, the god of excess,\" Kyros says, pointing at the person clad in leather and lingerie.\n\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you, darlings. For slaves aboard a Chaos vessel, might I say you're looking... delectable,\" Elios says in a deep, masculine voice, licking his lips as he stares at both you and Fay.\n\n\n\"Keep it in your pants, Elios,\" Kyros says. \"Next we have Elizabeth.\"\n\n\nElizabeth, the hooded girl reading the book, doesn't look up.\n\n\n\"She's risen to the position of leader of the One-Eyed Crows, a war-band that worships Tzeentch, the sorceror god. She easily reached the position through her amazing social abilities. Tell us about yourself, Elizabeth.\"\n\n\n\"Move along,\" Elizabeth says, making a circular motion with her hand without looking up.\n\n\n\"OK, Elizabeth. Finally, we have Durge, leader of the Black Rats war-band that worships Nurgle the plague god.\"\n\n\n\"Hello!\" the diseased man says, waving his spike-arms. \"It's a pleasure to meet you! I hope you're being treated well. I hope you're being fed enough. If not, it's probably because I've eaten all the food aboard this vessel!\"\n\n\nThe man, Durge, breaks into laughter as several maggots burst from his skin. You try not to get sick.\n\n\n\"You're here to meet the leaders of this fleet so that you know who you'll be answering. We want you both to lead the slave army.\"\n\n\n\"Slave army?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"The Uwais tribe soldiers, the previous batch of failed test subjects, the gladiator slaves and whatever else we can muster up. We'll hold the detonators to your explosive collars, but you'll hold a copy of the detonators for all the men under your command.\"\n\n\n\"There was a previous batch of failed test subjects?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Yes, there was. They were quite strong, but their minds were easily broken. Most weren't sentient, the sentient ones were insane. There was only one who you could even have a conversation with, the one I appointed leader. I'll show you to them some time after this. I assume you'll take the position?\"\n\n\n\"It's not like I have much choice,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We'll take it,\" Fay says, answering for the both of you.\n\n\n\"This slave army, ot whatever you want to call it, will give us the strength advantage to become a serious military power in this tiny little sector. We could conquer ourselves a little kingdom from the weak and undefended worlds. We could become a raiding fleet that could have us living a life of luxury. But one little slave army wouldn't even give us a chance against even the defenses on Pluto!\" Calpurnia says.\n\n\n\"I'll tear out your soul and devour it if you show anymore signs of cowardice!\" Kyros yells. \"Magos Cern, take Fay and Karth to see the previous batch of super-soldiers.\"\n\n\n\"I'll have to let the galaxy witness the shame of my failed creation when we release them on the galaxy. I might as well let the two adolescents have a preview of my sickening failure,\" Magos Cern says.\n\n\n\"We're not finished here!\" Calpurnia splutters angrily. \"I'm not launching my army on a suicide mission!\"\n\n\n\"My army! As long as you serve me, it's my army!\" Kyros screams.\n\n\n\"We take a vote, then,\" Calpurnia suggests.\n\n\n\"Fine, raise your hands if you don't want to go through with the assault, if you're a coward, if you're not loyal.\"\n\n\nCalpurnia defiantly holds up her hands. Elios holds up his next.\n\n\n\"Sorry, Kyros. I'm not dying.. I'm too young and beautiful to die fighting an unwinnable war,\" he says.\n\n\nDurge holds up a spike, looking ashamed.\n\n\n\"I'm loyal, Kyros, but I'm just as loyal to my men as you, and I won't see them die for nothing.\"\n\n\nElizabeth slowly raises a hand, looking up from her book for the first time. \n\n\n\"This plans suicide, Kyros. We both know that.\"\n\n\nKyros snarls in anger, looking around.\n\n\n\"That's me, Cern, Taj and Rebecca for attacking, and Elizabeth, Durge, Elios and Calpurnia for not doing so,\" Kyros says in a low growl.\n\n\n\"The slave leaders are the tie-breakers, then,\" Calpurnia says. \n\n\nKyros looks at you with a stare, holding onto the controller for your collars. Well, this seems like an obvious answer, even if it is a suicide mission.", "action_results": [{"action": "Support the assault on Terra", "result": "You keep your hand at your side, and while Fay raises an eyebrow, she does the same.\n\n\n\"Cowardly... but smart,\" Meliodas says. \"Perhaps you'll realize your potential after all.\"\n\n\n\"Good... good!\" Kyros says, his voice flooded with relief. \"The slaves are loyal!

We're slaves who are also slave masters of a slave army,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"Alright, I suppose so. Anyway, are you OK? We've walked a lot,\" Fay says.\n\n\n\"I'm fine,\" you smile. \"I don't know whether to be thankful you're looking out for me, or insulted you think I can't even walk that much.\"\n\n\nYou walk on, eventually entering a large, metal elevator. The elevator quickly begins descending down the ship.\n\n\n\"Alright, children. Listen up. We're going to wake our super-soldiers from their cyro-sleep. Don't make any sudden movements, don't make any loud noises, do nothing of the sort.\"\n\n\n\"Got it,\" you both say.\n\n\nThe elevator doors open, revealing hundreds of metal tubes lining the walls, the cyro-pods. Magos Cern walks forward, extending a metal tentacle that grows from her spike. The tentacle presses onto the consoles attached to the many pods, and three open. Cold air quickly floods out, and you watch as three lumbering monsters walk out. \n\n\n\"Behold, my failures,\" Magos Cern says.\n\n\nThe super-soldiers stand at eight feet tall, and are made of massive coils of muscle that makes them nearly twice as wide as even a normal man, without any armor. Their mouths are filled with hundreds of carnivorous teeth, like a shark's. They have short, four-inch bone claws extending from their wrists. Their skin is dark and misshapen, like someone tanned human skin to make leather and then stitched it over their bodies. They walk forward, grunting and growling. The first looks around, before stumbling back inside it's cyro-pod.\n\n\n\"Sleep... sleep... sleep...\" it mutters, walking back inside.\n\n\n\"Size isn't everything... but it sure as fuck counts for a lot,\" Meliodas remarks.\n\n\nThe other two immediately begin head-butting each other with grunts, and you hear the sound of heavy bones smashing against each other. Magos Cern takes out a small data pad, pressing it. The two super-soldiers grunt, wandering back to their cyro-pods.\n\n\n\"These are the super-soldiers. The guards here have given them the nickname \"Goliath's\". I suppose it's fitting. They're not smart, but they fear the lash and the electro-collar, so they follow orders easily.\"\n\n\nTo prove her point, Magos Cern pulls out a small datapad, quickly tapping it. The pair of super-soldiers roar in pain, backing up into their cyro-pods. Magos Cern quickly taps on the pad and the cyro-pods close. He strides forward, to another tank.\n\n\n\"Let me introduce you to Specimen 401245. It goes by the name Cain. It's the most intelligent of the beasts, and the most friendly. Now, here he is.\"\n\n\nThe cyro-pod opens as Magos Cern taps quickly on the datapad. You see another massive, lumbering Goliath wander out of the cyro-pod. It looks almost the exact same as the others, the only differences being a pair of bone growths sticking out of its forehead like horns and its oversized lips held up by hooks to allow it to breath. It steps out, taking in a deep breath, before staring at you. There's a brief silence, that Fay quickly breaks.\n\n\n\"Does... can it talk?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"It can definitely hear,\" the beast grunts in response.\n\n\n\"Um, hi there!\" Fay says. \"I'm Fay. What's your name?\"\n\n\n\"Cain,\" he responds, his voice a low, rumbling, guttural growling sound.\n\n\n\"I'm Karth,\" you say.\n\n\n\"What time is it?\" Cain asks.\n\n\n\"Time?\" you respond. \"I don't know. A little after noon, probably, or what the ship uses as noon.\"\n\n\n\"I don't care. What time is it for me?\"\n\n\n\"... uh... the same time?\"\n\n\n\"I am awake. I always sleep in the cold pod until I'm needed. I'm only needed to be cut up, drugged, poked and prodded, or to kill. What time is it for me to do? Kill, or be torn apart?\"\n\n\n\"Neither. I'm here to introduce you to Fay and Karth, the new leaders of your men.\"\n\n\n\"My men?

The cyro-pod shuts, leaving Cain back to his cold, endless sleep.\n\n\n\"We should continue,\" Magos Cern says. \"I still have to show you the gladiator slaves who you'll take under you command and the Uwais Tribe. The Goliaths will act as your heavy shock troopers, the gladiator-slaves will act as scouts, skirmishers and fill in whatever spare roles you have, and the Uwais tribe will be your main unit. I'll take you to see them.\"\n\n\nYou begin following Magos Cern out of the cyro-sleep area, and along the hallways. After ten minutes, you reach a large metal door, which opens to reveal a large room filled with bunk beds, with familiar bronze bodies lying in the beds. \n\n\n\"This is Dorm A. We have around sixty soldiers here,\" Magos Cern says.\n\n\nFay walks into the room, and lets ou a shout.\n\n\n\"Gentlemen! Your captain's back!\"\n\n\nThe tribals roll out of bed. You recognize a few of them, but strangely you recognize many as men from other various tribes.\"\n\n\n\"Fay, you're back!\" one says.\n\n\n\"How did the fight go? It took far longer than expected,\" another adds.\n\n\n\"Oh, shit! Is that Karth?\" another asks.\n\n\nThe attention immediately goes from Fay to you, as tribals begin appearing. They all appear far more muscular, many bearing fresh scars.\n\n\n\"Karth! How are you even still alive?\" someone asks incredulously.\n\n\n\"It's the Uwais shaman!\" another asks.\n\n\n\"Karth, how are you? What have they been doing to you?\"\n\n\nYou watch as the tribals begin to surround the three of you, although Magos Cern makes sure they keep as least half a dozen feat away from her. \n\n\n\"Stay back. Karth is only here to see you, not talk to you,\" Magos Cern says, drawing a datapad and letting out an electro-shock that causes the group to let out a pained yelp before they back away.\n\n\n\"Why are there so many men and women from other tribes? I thought it was the Uwais tribe who was kidnapped.\"\n\n\n\"When we arrived on your planet, we needed to do a lot of work. We drained lakes for water, drilled into the planet's crust to get vast quantities of Promethium, wiped out native species for food. It takes a lot of effort to run a vessel this large, and to do it quickly and efficiently. While we did so, our soldiers went to work. They needed to fight, both to train and to simply shed blood for their own enjoyment. Prisoners were taken in vast quantities, and I used them as I used the Uwais tribe. Now, there's far more from other tribes than there are from Uwais tribe.\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm... your home world is destroyed. Ambition is the only path forward now, Karth, there is no going back. We will conquer the stars together.\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"I suppose calling them the Uwais tribe is a bit of a failing, then. Tribals would be more suitable.\"\n\n\n\"As you wish. You are their superior. You can do as you wish with them.\"\n\n\n\"The average tribal will be be outfitted with combat armor as well as some equipment, such as grenades, gas masks, communications devices, that kind of thing. The stronger ones will get Bolters, the strongest will be equipped with melee weapons; chainswords, chainaxes, power swords, as well as bolt pistols. The weaker ones will be given specialized roles and equipped for as such: meltaguns and missile launchers for anti-armor, snipers with sniper rifles and stealth roles with chameoline cloaks and silenced weapons. We should have a fairly well equipped army that will be able to hold their own when fighting alongside the Guardsmen and Traitor Marines we have under our command.\"\n\n\n\"We're not fighting for you fucks!\" someone shouts. \n\n\n\"Yeah! Fuck you, you kidnapping bastards!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, this is an issue,\" Magos Cern says. \"Unfortunately, due to my... failures in work on the brain, Kyros has forbid me to tinker on their minds to ensure loyalty. Fay has only so far failed to do, so it'll be your job now. I need all rebelliousness to be crushed.\"\n\n\n\"How?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"Get it done. I don't care how. I need to go check on the oxygen decks to the macro guns on the starboard side doesn't asphyxiate,\" Magos says, turning around and walking off. \n\n\n\"Well, that's a bitch,\" you complain, turning to Fay. \"I guess we need to get rid of rebelliousness before Kyros gets pissy and blows our heads clean off.\"\n\n\n\"Or...\" Fay says slyly. \"We could just hide the rebelliousness. It would be better if we kept it under wraps until we have a chance to get out of here.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, choices, choices, choices. Terrify, threaten, talk or trust. Which shall it be, Karth?\" Meliodas says.\n\n\nYou walk forward, into the center of the dorm. You have several options here. You could attempt to use some of your psychic powers to show these tribals the true power of the Warp. That would definitely ensure their loyalty, if only out of fear. You could threaten them to ensure their loyalty, once again while out of fear, and you wouldn't have to alienate yourself by making yourself seem like a terrifying psychic being. You could attempt to convince the tribals that loyalty to this place is the only rational choice. You could also take Fay's path, and assure them that they'll have the chance to get revenge, but that for now they should hide all rebelliousness until it's time to strike.

Not gone, still definitely there. You know if you try anything you'll gain his attention and the restrictions will be tightened, as well as the collar around your throat, most likely. Still, you need to take advantage of this and put on a full show. \n\n\nYou walk slowly forward, raising into the air. Black and purple electricity begins running along your body, bursting along yourself. You set alight, as the crimson flames of the Warp engulf. You change your meek and timid voice, amplifying it through the Warp to booming proportions.\n\n\n\"Do you see what I've become? Do you see what Kyros made me? I am a vessel of Chaos, a being of the Warp. This is the power the Warp holds. This is the power Kyros holds, the power this vessel holds, and the power of the cursed men who guard and crew it. You can't possibly hope to beat it. You should only thank the Dark Gods that the role they've asked you to fill is beneficial to you, and embrace this role to the utmost.\"\n\n\nThe tribals, including Fay, stand back, looking terrified. You know in that moment that fear has replaced all rebelliousness in their souls. They'll follow orders now. You drop down to your feet, staring around.\n\n\n\"Spread the message,\" you say to the tribals, before turning to Fay. \"We should go.\"\n\n\nYou walk out of the room, quickly followed by Fay, who runs after you.\n\n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"I did my job,\" you say simply.\n\n\n\"Those are our friends, our family, our kinsman. You're not seriously happy with a life of service to a guy who kidnapped us? These guys killed Duggin!\"\n\n\n\"Duggin was a fool,\" you reply. \"Our lives were once meaningless. Now, we have a hope. Surely you understand?\"\n\n\n\"I wish I could say I could, Karth, but I don't. I don't know how you can think that.\"\n\n\nYou walk outside, where Kyros awaits, smiling.\n\n\n\"Well done,\" he says, smiling. \"Impressive display.\"\n\n\n\"You were there for that?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I was aware. Why else would your collar restrictions be weaker?\"\n\n\n\"I assumed it was because you were distracted,\" you admit.\n\n\n\"If that was true, whenever I slept you'd be free to do whatever you wanted,\" Kyros says, smirking. \"Now, we need to visit the last of your soldiers, the gladiator-slaves. They're always an interesting crew. Shall we go?\"\n\n\nYou look at Fay, who nods, although she still looks nervous from your earlier \"display\" of power.\n\n\n\"Yes, let's,\" you reply.", "action_results": [{"action": "Visit the gladiator-slaves", "result": "You follow Kyros, as you head to the arena. You reach the doors that would lead into it, but instead oof entering you go off to a small elevator behind it. You enter, and it slowly begins descending. It opens, revealing the underhive of the arena. There's dozen of cages, holding exotic beasts and dangerous Xenos. You see a half dozen thick, heavily muscled, green-skinned Orks in a cage, their necks chained to the wall. They're howling and roaring, tugging at their chains. Surprisingly, while most shout in their barbaric, guttural language, one seems to speak yours.\n\n\n\"Humie! Humie! Get me free! Get me free!\" he shouts. \"I is gonna let you live, even give ya a bitta loot and an escape pod if ya let me free!\"\n\n\n\"Don't respond!\" someone further down the catacombs that lay beneath the arena shouts. \"It only encourages Ol' Dak!\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm... this Ork must be one of the greatest speakers of his kind,\" Meliodas points out. \"Of course to us he's a fucking idiot.\"\n\n\nThe ork's eyes narrow, before he begins howling in frustration and smacking his hands against his own head, a heavy thud emanating as his muscled fists slam into his thick skull. You continue walking, passing amazing and fantastic creatures and gladiators. There's a tentacled slug-man with a large beak and dozens of eyes peppered around his body which is huddled up in the corner of it's cage, a trio of horrible bird-hound creatures that scratch at their bars, a massive human wearing what appears to be an iron cage with hundreds of inward pointing nails who rams himself against the cage wall, his body shredded to such an extent you're amazed he's not dead yet, a multi-legged, horned creature that looks almost cute. Finally, you reach a long hallway, with thick, heavy metal doors spread along the hallway. An eye peers out of a door eye-slot, staring at you.\n\n\n\"Hello there. Do we have more fighters, or...? Oh wait, it's them. Terrific.\"\n\n\nThe eye disappears, and the slot closes. Kyros takes out a datapad, pressing several buttons before the door slowly slides open, revealing a large open area. Bunk beds line the wall, with a bunch of young men and women, the oldest in their late twenties and the youngest in their mid-teens. They wear very little armor, all of which is either leather or light combat armor. They sit around a fire, roasting chunks of meat on sticks in it. Two of the gladiators lean against the beds nearest to you, staring at you. One is a tall, muscled and tanned, with long blond hair and sparking green eyes. She holds a long, rifle-like gun with an axe blade made into the barrel with a grip under it. The other is shorter, with similarly tanned skin, with playful green eyes and curly brown hair, holding a curved sword and a Plasma pistol. They both look to be in their late teens or early twenties at latest.\n\n\n\"Is that a fire?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Are they armed?\" you also.\n\n\n\"Yes and yes,\" the male says, turning to the girl. \"This question game is fun.\"\n\n\n\"The fire's below a vent that's sending the smoke... somewhere. We weren't exactly given schematics of this place, all we know is the smoke doesn't bother us. And we're allowed weapons to keep the others in check. Even if we both went for Kyros, our minds would be shattered before we could raise our weapons,\" the girl says.\n\n\n\"Nah, I could at least start a swing before I was killed.\"\n\n\n\"These are the Twins. They lead the Gladiator-Slaves. Now, introduce yourselves,\" Kyros says.\n\n\n\"I'm Castus,\" the boy smiles, staring at the pair of you.\n\n\nHis eyes flicker, as he looks over Fay. He appears to be checking her out. You feel like punching him in the throat, but refrain.\n\n\n\"You're a jealous one, aren't you?\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"I'm Olive,\" the girl says, extending a hand, which you grab and shake before Fay does the same. \n\n\n\"So, is there a reason you're here?\" Castus asks.\n\n\n\"Fay and Karth will be taking command of the gladiators. They are my lieutenants, and will command a segment of our army, the slaves.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, terrific. We've been shafted,\" Castus says.\n\n\n\"I'm sure Kyros will want us to have an advisor position to assist Fay and Karth,\" Olive says.\n\n\n\"Correct,\" Kyros says.\n\n\n\"Well, there might be an issue with that,\" Castus says. \"You see, both Fay and Karth have a history of... well, murdering my men. Pitting the Kyros Jr and Magos Cern's latest brand of super-freaks against us has led to a lot of men being, quite understandably, pissed with the guys who hacked apart, or psychically exploded, or simply beat their friends upside the head until they went comatose.\"\n\n\n\"If you want, we can have the dissenters flailed alive. Simply point them out, and I'll have them broken. Is that preferable?\"\n\n\nCastus goes quiet. \n\n\n\"As I thought,\" Kyros says with a smile. \"Make sure the men know to follow orders. Now, it's late, and these guys need sleep. Is anything else needed?\"\n\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Olive says.\n\n\n\"Well, we need a lot, but nothing we're realistically getting anytime soon,\" Castus says.\n\n\nKyros stares at Castus, fire beginning to run along his body.\n\n\n\"Nothing needed, sir,\" Castus says.\n\n\n\"Good. Fay, Karth, let's go,\" Kyros says.\n\n\nKyros swivels around, walking out of the room. You quickly follow him, and the massive metal door shuts behind you.\n\n\n\"So, we'll escort Fay back to the Uwais dorms, and then send you to your room,\" Kyros says.\n\n\n\"Well you know, Karth's room is closer. I could just spend the time in his,\" Fay suggests. \"It would give us some time to go over battle plans now that we know what our men are capable of, and I can inform him of what the Uwais tribe are like in battle...\"\n\n\n\"Really?

Thanks for trying,\" she says, giving a short little wave.\n\n\n\"Bye, Fay,\" you reply.\n\n\nThe doors are shut, and you walk over to your bed, collapsing on it. Only now do you realize how exhausted you are. You've spent all day walking, which again isn't exactly your specialty. You close your eyes, and soon sleep takes you.

You wander the endless mountain of skulls, hiding in terror from the daemonic beasts that roam. Eventually, you awaken with a start, finding yourself lying in bed in a cold sweat, naked and scared.

A pretty small one, to be fair,\" she says with a smile.\n\n\nYou find a little leeway with your collar, and eagerly use it through the flick of a wrist and send Fay onto her behind once more. The collar tightens around your throat quickly, making it hard to breath but not unbearable. You raise your hands in surrender, and Kyros releases the collar. \n\n\n\"We're going to the war room,\" he says, softly but creepily. \n\n\nKyros seems considerably darker today. His coat is covered with several dark red splotches and stains. You doubt it's a good idea to ask about their origins. You stand up, following Kyros along the halls.\n\n\n\"What's in the war room?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We're just having a meeting. Quiet now,\" Kyros says.\n\n\nYou walk along the hallways in silence, passing my various crewmen running along the halls, working. Kyros walks quickly and you break a sweat trying to walk at his pace.\n\n\n\"Can we slow down?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"You're a genetically-upgraded super-soldier.

Now silence!\"\n\n\nKyros flicks his wrists, and Fay yelps. A long, thin cut appears, running down her cheek, as blood runs down her chin.\n\n\n\"Hey!\" you shout.\n\n\nYou step up, staring into Kyros' eyes. His eyes are wild and cruel. The humor and joy he held only a few hours ago is gone. You realize that he'll be more than happy to hurt both you and Fay seriously. You back down.\n\n\n\"That's what I thought. Now faster, we've wasted time with this!\" Kyros says.\n\n\nYou speed up, moving as quickly as possible. Soon enough you reach the war room. The doors open, and you pause. Inside, lying in her seat, is Calpurnia. All of her skin is just... missing, seemingly flayed off her. Blood covers her seat, the the floor around her and the table. Her eyes are missing, seemingly gored out by inhuman claws. She lets out a pained moan, and you realize with a start that she's somehow alive.\n\n\n\"What the fuck...?\" Fay says.\n\n\nMagos Cern appears behind you, walking forward. She stares at Calpurnia, seemingly disinterested.\n\n\n\"Does this concern me?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"No, old friend.This concerns the others,\" Kyros says, his voice a low growl.\n\n\nUncaring, Kyros sits down at the table. Taj enters, but doesn't even respond, simply taking his place at the table. Calpurnia holds up a hand as if begging for help, but Taj simply spits on the table.\n\n\n\"Traitor,\" he grunts.\n\n\nYou watch as Durge walks in, with Elizabeth at his side. Durge pauses, looking at Calpurnia, before looking at Kyros, as Elizabeth turns very pale. \n\n\n\"What the hell is this?\" Durge asks, staring down at Calpurnia.\n\n\nHis massive, bloated frame waddles forward, standing over the bleeding near-corpse.\n\n\n\"What happened you, he asks, before shoving a spike-arm in front of Elizabeth and pushing her back, stepping in front of her defensively as he stares at the rest of the room. \"Who did this?!\"\n\n\nRebecca walks in, a grin on her face.\n\n\n\"Oh, who did this?\" she asks, clearly feigning surprise.\n\n\nFinally, Elios walks in, pausing, and looking around the room, taken aback.\n\n\n\"What... what happened?\" he asks, turning even paler than his chalk-white makeup.\n\n\n\"It seems our good friend Calpurnia has been attacked in the dead of night,\" Kyros says. \"Imagine how much pain she's feeling. The pain of her wounds. The pain of her betrayal. Who hear could have possibly betrayed them? Who could have plotted late in the night to back stab a person, to betray someone who had given them so much? Could it have been Elios? Durge? Elizabeth?\"\n\n\n\"Fuck... you,\" Calpurnia says, before collapsing her head against the table.\n\n\nCalpurnia screams as her arm's bare flesh begins to cook, as Kyros glares at her. Durge raises a spike, running it through Calpurnia's head.\n\n\n\"Enough. There's no need to prolong her suffering,\" Durge says, glaring at Kyros.\n\n\n\"I suppose. Perhaps it's best that she died. Do you know what, Durge? Magos Cern, Chapter Master Taj and Rebecca all came to me, told me a coup was being planned by Calpurnia, and she was recruiting all the faction leaders. I'm sure she hadn't gotten around to asking you, Elizabeth and Elios yet, or you would've reported it to me. Correct?\"\n\n\nDurge stares at Kyros, not saying a word.\n\n\n\"Well, I'll have someone investigate who could have possibly done this to our dear friend. Anyone, as for the purpose of this meeting, I just wanted to tell you we're all out of Recaf, and I'll have it replaced by tomorrow. I also suppose I must say I'm taking control of the 33rd Istanford Regiment in the wake of Calpurnia's passing. Now, everyone back to their duties. We're in a risky time. Who knows who'll have the next... accident?\"\n\n\nKyros walks out of the room, and you and Fay follow him. He immediately has you set to work. He has you train with a few of your new men, fighting off dozens of crab-like aliens with a handful of Goliaths, Tribals and Gladiators to learn how they fight. The Tribals still work with their hunting tactics and the methods of war used to fight off the endless greenskin attacks, so you find you're easily able to lead them to victory.\n\n\nThe Goliaths are borderline idiots, who even in the heat of battle get distracted by themselves and each other, get frustrated when their massive hands fail to successfully reload their bolters, and are more than happy to break formation to charge the enemy. Cain proves himself as a solid leader, taking you orders and bellowing them out with massive, powerful lungs, loud enough to snap the Goliaths back to violence. The Goliaths make up for their mental failings with their extreme strength, withstanding punishment beyond what you thought was possible, whilst turning steel to dust with their powerful blows.\n\n\nThe Gladiators' fighting style is an interesting one. Due to the lifestyle of gladiators, they haven't really trained for being part of a large unit, only knowing how to fend for themselves or maybe fight alongside a small unit of a half dozen people. They're good, experienced fighters, but despite their experience they're still young and wild, taking unnecessary risks in battle and acting far too prideful. While Castus is wild and barely acts as a leader in battle other than shouting out curses at the enemies, rallying his men and leading a charge whenever necessary, Olive is calm, collected and acts as the real leader, spitting out battlefield tactics that allow for a crushing defeat. The gladiators also have a certain showmanship, no doubt because they're performers before they're fighters. The gladiators' attacks maximize bloodshed and feature extravagant yet unnecessary feats of agility, something that needs to be eliminated from their battle doctrine.\n\n\nAll in all, your newfound force is fairly competent. You're satisfied with their ability to fight, which is bolstered by your immense powers, the only outlet of which are these arena battles. After several long hours fighting, just as you're too exhausted to continue fight, the massive metal gates from which the aliens spew slam closed.\n\n\nYou hover in the air, firing a stream of multi-colored fire that consumes a crab-alien, before you swoop down, firing a psychic blast directly into the unarmored face of another. Your forces wipe out the remaining beasts, and soon the fighting is over, leaving you surrounded by corpses, blood and bolter shells. The metal gate you came through opens, and you drop to the ground, feeling your collar begin to restrain your psychic powers again, before standing and beginning to walk back inside. \n\n\n\"Well done, men. You've proven yourselves today,\" you say.\n\n\nYour four guards wait by the gate, alongside dozens of other guards to ensure none of you attempt a mistake. The gladiators are led to the underneath of the arena, the Goliaths back to cyro-sleep and the Tribals to their cell-dorms. You're quickly escorted to your room, and the doors close behind you. You walk forward, quickly undressing from your blood-stained, sweat-soaked clothes before collapsing on your bed, burying your head in your pillow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to sleep", "result": "\"Karth!\" Meliodas' voice says, appearing in your mind. \"Look behind you, you fool!\"\n\n\nYou quickly twist around in bed, raising your fists and preparing to use what little psychic powers, to see Elios leaning in the doorway of your bathroom. \n\n\n\"Shit!

If we're unlucky, we're going to end up like Calpurnia, tortured to death by a paranoid Psyker.\"\n\n\n\"You're at risk of being tortured to death. I never betrayed him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, baby, why do you have to be so difficult?\" Elios smiles, two of his fingers walking up your legs, slowly nearing your groin. \"Baby, at the moment, Kyros is looking to eliminate those who are going to betray him. But he's growing paranoid. He'll end thinking you're going to betray him, whether you are or are not. Let's be fair, you do have motives. Your tribe destroyed or enslaved, forced to bear the troubles that a Psyker does? Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if you had an escape plan in the works. Hell, even if he doesn't, one of your men will act rebellious or a battle will go wrong, and you'll be blamed for it. You need to get with us, baby.\"\n\n\n\"Let's say I'm considering it. What would it entail?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"You need to get the leaders on your side. Fay, Olive, Castus, whoever's in charge of those big monster boys I saw you working with earlier.

Blissfully, there's only a few dark, terror-filled dreams, the rest only filling your with a vague, uneasy sense of dread. You awaken to Magos Cern poking you in the stomach with a white-hot pincer.\n\n\n\"AH!\" you scream. \"What the fuck?\"\n\n\n\"My diagnostics told me that I'd be able to wake you up 0.4 seconds faster this way.

You find yourself in a massive cafeteria. You walk forward, spotting Fay sitting alongside a badly burnt girl with a long braid wrapping around herself and another with a prosthetic arm replaced by a sharpened, mechanical claw. Fay looks up, noodles hanging from her mouth, spotting you.\n\n\n\"Oh, Karth!\" she says, waving, before noticing that her mouth is filled with noodles and blushing.\n\n\nYou take a seat next to her, and she smiles.\n\n\n\"So, how are you doing?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"We need to talk. Alone,\" you say, looking at the two tribals beside her.\n\n\n\"Uh...

You stare into her bright green eyes, the split-second kiss lasting for infinitely longer, feeling the warmth of her lips flood into you, before she pulls back.\n\n\n\"Well, that was nice. Ideally our next rendezvous is going to take place somewhere where we're not surrounded by our tribe and horrible guards who want us dead,\" Fay smiles. \"Was that it, or was there something else?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, we have something important to discuss.\"\n\n\n\"Wasn't that important?\" Fay asks, smiling.\n\n\n\"Oh no,it was, I just... I meant important for the tribe, not just for us,\" you say, stumbling over your words.\n\n\n\"It feels nice to see you've become as awkward as I just was,\" Fay giggles. \"Now, stop spitting out words. Take a breath, and tell me what's so important.\"\n\n\n\"Rebellion.\"\n\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\n\"Kyros is mad and paranoid. He's either going to slit our throats or send us on an endless string of suicide missions. We need to do something, and I really need your help. A group of collaborators have planned to rise up, and rid ourselves of Kyros. Then, we take over. I need the support of your Tribals to do so.\n\n\n\"Yeah, totally. Done.\"\n\n\n\"Done?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah. If we don't escape, we die here. Also, they're your Tribals as much as mine. Who else is in on this?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Elios, Durge and Elizabeth are all in. No doubt Calpurnia's man will help us,\" you say.\n\n\n\"What about Cain and the twins?\"\n\n\n\"I haven't asked them yet, but we need to get them on board,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Do we hae a solid plan yet?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Not yet. We need to find out how many people we have fighting for us.\"\n\n\n\"What happens after we take the ship,\" Fay asks, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"That is still to be decided. Once we have Cain. Castus and Olive behind us, we'll have bargaining power. So you're in?\"\n\n\n\"I'm in,\" Fay nods. \"I'll have the message spread among the tribals.\"\n\n\nYou notice one of your guards walking towards you, carrying a tray. You motion for Fay to quiet down, as the guard arrives putting the tray down on the table.\n\n\n\"Eat,\" he says, in a cold voice like the scraping of a blade on rusted metal.\n\n\nYou look at your food. There's a bowl of noodles and strips of thin, cured meat, a small bowl of green jelly with chunks of odd, alien fruit inside, a large plastic cup of wine and a small, dense biscuit-like cake.\n\n\n\"Well, someone's being pampered,\" Fay says, smiling.\n\n\n\"Clearly I'm just more important than you,\" you gloat as you have a forkful of noodles and meat. \n\n\nFay grabs the biscuit cake from your tray, taking a bite.\n\n\n\"Hey!\" you say in annoyance, as Fay sticks her tongue out.\n\n\nYou quickly eat your meal, polishing off the entire tray and gulping down the wine. Then, Magos Cern arrives.\n\n\n\"Good, you've eaten,\" she says. \"These operations will be safer if you've had a full stomach.\"\n\n\n\"OK, I'm ready, let's go, you say. \"Bye, Fay. See you soon.\"\n\n\n\"See you later, Fay says, blowing a kiss.\n\n\nMagos Cern leads you out of the cafeteria and along the halls, off along halls and elevators. Eventually, you pass through the cyro-sleep section, arriving in a large operating room. Dozens of Goliaths are lying on the surgery tables, many halfway through surgery. A half dozen other Tech Priests wander around between the Goliaths, removing and adding flesh, bone, organs, cybernetic implants and other strange things.\n\n\n\"I didn't know there were other Tech Priests,\" you note.\n\n\n\"This ship is the size of a small moon. Did you think you've seen enough of it to accurately be able to say that we don't have something? I have scores of Tech Priests who followed me into the embrace of the Dark Gods,\" Magos Cern says.\n\n\nMagos Cern leads you to an operating table.\n\n\n\"This is yours. Please get undressed and wait here, I need to grab my materials and equipment. Stay here.\"\n\n\nMagos Cern turns around, walking off, leaving you alone. You spot Cain, lying on his operating table, his chest cut open to reveal still functioning organs. You wonder how he can still be alive with such a hastily cut-up torso, before you wince as you see his eyes dart towards you and you realize he's conscious. Looking to see Magos Cern hobbling away, you hop off the operating table and walk over to him.\n\n\n\"Commander Karth,\" Cain grunts. \"Need something?\"\n\n\n\"I have... an offer.\"\n\n\n\"An offer? An offer of what?\" Cain says, absent-mindedly picking at a cut alongside his... or at least, one of his stomachs.\n\n\n\"Freedom,\" you say, catching the monster's attention.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" Cain says, furrowing his scarred brow and causing a thin stream of blood to pour from his horns.\n\n\n\"We're planning an escape. We could use you and your men,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\n\"Elios, Durge, Elizabeth, Fay, others,\" you say. \"That's it, I think.\"\n\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\n\"We don't have details, yet. We need a head count before we can start planning it.\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm... I'm willing to give you control of my... \"Goliaths\", as you called them. But, I have a list of conditions that I want to be satisfied once we take the ship.\"\n\n\n\"Go on,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I want us to get names. Every Goliath who is capable of remembering and answering to a name will be called that instead of its serial number, by you and ALL other members of command. No more cyro-sleep. I want a bed for every single Goliath. I don't care if it's fine cloth or a slab of concrete, as long as it doesn't freeze them, it'll do us. I want free time that's not just killing.\"\n\n\n\"Anything else?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"That's it,\" Cain says, spitting out a serrated teeth that's fallen free from his jaw. \n\n\nCain's demands are far from unfair. Really, all he wants is slightly more rights for his Goliaths, which wouldn't even take any more resources. Still, you don't want the beast getting a big head. You ARE still in charge of not only his collar, but the collars of every single Goliath.

You shake vigorously, and Cain attempts a smile. The corners of his mouth twist unnaturally high, revealing rows of serrated teeth, curved fangs, massive molars and many other weird, odd teeth, protruding from bloody, rotten gums. You smile in response, not willing to offend him.\n\n\n\"The beast would've taken half of what he asked for,\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me that before?\" you say angrily.\n\n\n\"I presumed you knew,\" Meliodas replies.\n\n\n\"Are you OK?\" Cain says. \"Tell you what?\"\n\n\n\"Uh, nothing. Sorry,\" you say.\n\n\n\"OK. Good deal,\" Cain says, his face contorted in what you assume is his version of a raising of the eyebrow. \"Alright, best get prepared for your operation before Magos Cern gets back.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I should,\" you say.\n\n\nYou walk over to your operating table and quickly get undressed, before lying down. After another minute or two, Magos Cern appears, pushing a tray in front of her. One of her metallic tendrils grabs a syringe filled with a pale, translucent liquid.\n\n\n\"This might hurt a little. It will more likely hurt a lot more,\" she says.\n\n\nYou let out a pained yelp as she jams the syringe into your neck. She begins pushing down on the plunger as what you hope is anesthetic is pumped into you.

If anything goes wrong, go to Genetor Corivan. He is very experienced with medical matters.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the space marine says.\n\n\nMagos Cern quickly heads off, walking off to a row of elevators. The space marines stare at you, and you climb out of bed with a groan.\n\n\n\"Ah, my head,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You should have headaches for the next 48 hours,\" Magos Cern shouts, right before she disappears into an elevator. \n\n\nYou stand, feeling a rush of blood hit your head. You walk after the space marines, along halls and up and down elevators, until you find yourself in the arena. Castus and Olive are there, mid-battle with each other.\n\n\n\"Oh look, it's tweedle-dum and tweedle-fucking idiot,\" Meliodas says. \"Not even a laugh? Oh wait, you didn't grow up with nursery rhymes, you're from a Feral world. My bad.\"\n\n\nCastus swings his sword at her, while Olive swings her rifle-axe up at his head. He rolls out of the way, kicking Olive's foot away and sending her to her knee, before booting her in the head. She collapses down, before rolling out of the way to avoid a downward stab by Castus. She grabs Castus' sword handle and punches him. Castus falls backwards, before taking up a fighting stance. Olive begins circling him, her gun-axe at the ready.

End of training.\"\n\n\n\"Terrific,\" you say. \"So, can I leave?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'll call your guards here to open the gates and take you off,\" Castus says, grabbing a walkie-talkie hanging from his belt and speaking into it.\n\n\n\"Yeah, we're finished here,\" he says. \"Oh shit, over.\"\n\n\n\"Affirmative, out,\" the voice comes back. \n\n\nSoon, the gate lifts up as your guards saunter out in their thick power armor. \n\n\n\"Where to next, boys?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Shut it, psyker,\" one growls, looking at Castus and Olive. \"Is it back to the cells for you two?\"\n\n\n\"We're happy to practice some more here,\" Olive says, twirling her gun-axe to stop a surprise attack from Castus. \"I mean, if this dumb bastard has done so little practice to think that would take me down, he's go to need a lot more practice.\"\n\n\n\"Pffh, I'd like to see you take me down,\" Castus says.\n\n\n\"So be it,\" your captor growls. \"Move it, psyker.\"\n\n\nYou raise your hands defensively, and allow them to escort you back to your room.", "action_results": [{"action": "Three Days Later...", "result": "There's no peep from Elios, Durge or Elizabeth over the next few days. There's more of the usual, training, fighting and such. Eventually though, as you put your head down on the pillow, you hear a familiar voice.\n\n\n\"Karth, talking to you with that collar on is painfully hard. Can you start checking the shadows so I don't have to do this?\" Meliodas says.\n\n\nYou twist around in bed, to spot a familiar figure in the corner, wearing tight, very revealing black leather with heavy make-up.\n\n\n\"Why do we have a habit of meeting like this?\" Elios says.\n\n\n\"Fuck,\" you say, jumping up in bed.\n\n\n\"Is that an order? Because I'm more than willing to... serve,\" he says, licking his lips. \n\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\n\n\"We're meeting up. We have plans to make. Shall we go?\" Elios smiles.\n\n\n\"Uh... sure,\" you reply.\n\n\nElios strides over to the door, knocking on it. The guards open, and Elios once again deceives them so they easily step aside.\n\n\n\"How do you do that?\" you ask, as you stroll past your guards.\n\n\n\"Serving Slaanesh has it's benefits. Charisma, beauty, the ability to bend people to your desires, and an ever-lasting... stamina,\" he says, breathing the last word.\n\n\n\"Ah, good to know,\" you say.\n\n\nYou stroll through the hallways, heading down a path you've never headed down before. Eventually, you find yourself in a seemingly abandoned section, entering a large room that's been done up like a war-room.\n\n\n\"This is the old war-room. Kyros had a new one built in a position safer from boarding actions. From here, we run the mutiny.\"\n\n\nYou look around the room, taking note of who's here. Durge sits in a large wooden chair, pricking boils along his belly with his spike-arms. Elizabeth sits in the corner, reading a datapad. A young man, seemingly in his twenties, leans against a wall, smoking and scratching his thick stubble, with a shaved head, scarred face and sallow skin. Cain is scratching the scarred cuts that run along his leathery bare chest. Castus is playing with a knife, while Olive leans against the wall, drinking from a canteen. Fay leans against the wall, noticing you instantly.\n\n\n\"Hey, Karth,\" she smiles, walking up to you. \"How'd Elios get you out of your cell?\"\n\n\n\"Did some deceiving trick on the guards. You?\"\n\n\n\"Elizabeth put the guard's to sleep somehow,\" Fay replies.\n\n\n\"Alright, boys. We're all here. Shall we begin?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, let's go through this,\" Durge says.\n\n\nDurge stands, scratching the side of his stomach as you see something furry scuttling through his intestines. You try not to get sick, or to simply set the entire monstrosity known as Durge aflame to cauterize his disgusting form, before reassuring yourself that he's on your side.\n\n\n\"Sssh, sssh,\" Durge says, patting the side of his stomach, before grabbing a remote from the large metal table and turning on a large blue hologram of the ship, the Roar of the Vortex. \"Here she is. We need to start planning how to grasp control of the ship. Remember, this isn't a planet. We don't win by capturing more territory than the enemy has. We need to capture the necessary areas.\"\n\n\nThe hologram begins to change, as various sections become different colors.\n\n\n\"These black sections are abandoned by crew. They're either unnecessary cargo space, unused dorms or functional sections whose functions are either redundant, have been taken over by other sections or are being fulfilled by whoever remains in these sections.\"\n\n\n\"I thought they were abandoned,\" Fay says.\n\n\n\"Abandoned by the crew, not abandoned by all. You must remember just how large this vessel is. Certain sections were crewed by slaves or mutants who, from lack of contact with crew members, have regressed to a feral state. Many of them now fulfill their roles, such as cleaning pipes or pumping air or working generators, because they consider it a religious ritual, necessary for their food, water and waste pipes to continue or just do it without knowing why.\"\n\n\n\"Ah. How... terrifying to know that that's a reality,\" Fay says.\n\n\n\"Their sacrifice is necessary,\" Durge shrugs. \"Now, I shall continue. These brown sections are entirely ran by mutants. These mutants hold no loyalty to either side, and fulfill non-essential roles, or at least roles that aren't essential short-term. For the term's of this... mutiny, these spaces are as irrelevant as the abandoned areas. Now, we get onto the important things. These green sections are, or at least will definitely, be controlled by us. The Black Rat's floors, the Shrieking Harpies' floors, the One Eyed Crows' floors, the arena and arena catacombs, the cyro-sleep area, the medical bay, the Tribals' dormitories, and the 22nd Regiment's dormitories. The 22nd Regiment is, for the most part, under our command, although their are loyalists to Kyros, so it will take some time for them to sort out that issue in the mutiny. These red sections are the enemy's. Kyros' chambers, the Bloody Claw's floors, the Techpriests' sections, the floors used by the Undying Reapers, and the floors controlled by those who will almost certainly be loyal to Kyros, whether they be from assimilated war-bands or his original allies he had when first capturing this vessel.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, the hologram shifts again, as the sections become either black, grey, blue, green or gold.\n\n\n\"These sections in black are irrelevant. Ignore them. These areas in grey are of little importance, but these are still a benefit to hold. The blue sections should be captured. The green sections are of more importance than the green sections, and should be prioritized. These gold sections, the command bridge, the engines and the macro-cannon decks, are completely necessary. We need these for victory. Now, Elizabeth shall go into details on the objectives, and Elios shall divide our forces.\"\n\n\nElizabeth stands up, walking towards the hologram, as Durge collapses into his seat. \n\n\n\"Thank you, brother. Now, we have four main objectives. The first is to kill Kyros. If we're lucky, that should get much of his forces to surrender. Hopefully, Rebecca will as well,\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\n\"She won't surrender,\" Elios says.\n\n\n\"She might,\" Durge says hopefully.\n\n\n\"I've know her the longest. She never gave up. When dad gave her the choice of apologizing for breaking the barn's windows in exchange for half as many lashes, she spat in his eye. As long as she has a limb left, she'll fight us. And I'm counting her head as a limb,\" Elios says.\n\n\n\"Well... we can hope,\" Elizabeth says. \"The second objective is to capture the golden sections. The third and fourth objectives are to capture as many servitors as possible and Drake Amadeus, respectively.\"\n\n\n\"Who the fuck is Drake Amadeus, and what's a servitor?\" Castus asks loudly.\n\n\n\"A servitor is a partly biological machine, made from machinery and the body of a criminal, slave or cloned body. They're not sentient, but are controlled by the Techpriests and used as their workforce. They do the bulk work of maintaining the ship. Capturing as many of them should make the transfer of power... easier. Drake Amadeus is an extremely powerful Navigator, a species of mutant who have a psychic third eye that allows it to see through the Warp and allow us to navigate through the Warp. Drake is one of the few Navigators powerful enough to allow a ship this large to navigate safely. If we don't secure him, we lose all abilities to go at the speed of light. In other words, we drift through space until we all starve to death. So, Drake is an important objective. Those are our four main objectives. If we fail in any of those, we fail in everything. There are dozens of other objectives, such as securing medical supplies, finding food, what have you. Those can be handed out to the individual groups. Elios?\"\n\n\nElios stands up, strolling over to the hologram as Elizabeth sits down.\n\n\n\"Now, we have a sizeable force. The Shrieking Harpies, the Black Rats, the One-Eyed Crows, the 22nd Regiment, the Tribals, the Goliaths and the Gladiators. We even have a... special asset,\" he says, looking at you. \"Whilst each of these factions on their own are fairly effective, combined they're infinitely stronger. Here are lists of what forces you'll command, and which of the forces you were to command will be transferred to another leader.\"\n\n\nVarious rolls of parchment and datapads, a strange mix of tech levels, is passed out. You raise an eyebrow as you realize you've not been given anything.\n\n\n\"Why didn't I get something?\" you ask.\n\n\nElios smiles as you.\n\n\n\"Putting you with a large force would be a waste of resources. Putting you with a small force would leave you wiping out too many enemies, unable to hold the ground you've already taken. So, we're going to use your as a specialty item. We're sending you to capture the prisoners. Release the ones you deem trustworthy, and secure them. Most importantly, secure Drake Amadeus. Understood?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, got it,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Once you have, we'll regroup forces, and make a move to finish off Kyros and his lieutenants.\"\n\n\n\"Got it,\" you say. \n\n\n\"When?\" Cain asks in his monstrous voice.\n\n\n\"Soon. Within the next few days. We need time to spread the orders, make preparations and Elizabeth needs time to find a way to deactivate the various collars and explosives planted on the slaves. Be ready at all moments,\" Durge says.\n\n\n\"How do we know when to strike?\" Olive asks.\n\n\n\"We're going to have explosives planted to take out as many loyalists as possible. When you hear massive explosives, or if you're too far away when the alarms start, your collars should deactivate given that I succeed, which I will, and then strike and go immediately to your objective. Understood?\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\n\"Got it,\" Olive nods.\n\n\nElios begins passing out files.\n\n\n\"Look over these, then leave them to be burnt,\" Elios says.\n\n\nYou're passed a file, and eagerly grab it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Look at the files", "result": "You look at the files and see three subheadings: Drake Amadeus, the Penthouse, Charles Antonguella and the Troupe of Dancing Blades.

He'll use any information he has against you,\" Meliodas chides.\n\n\n\"Huh. If you had told me that earlier, I wouldn't have tried to murder you,\" Drake said. \"I know an attack on Terra's as stupid as everyone else does.\"\n\n\n\"Shut it,\" you say.\n\n\n\"OK, OK, got it,\" Drake says.\n\n\nYou step over the corpses, and begin heading toward the war room. You spot a pair of Bloody Claws in long leather jackets, blood covering their faces, acting as a war-paint, arching with lasguns. You clench your hand into a fist, crushing their two heads together. You continue walking. Soon, you reach the door to the war room. You knock sharply on the door.\n\n\n\"Yo, who's there?\" a voice you don't recognize answers back.\n\n\n\"Karst,\" you reply.\n\n\nThe door swings open, revealing the scarred, shaved soldier from a few days ago.\n\n\n\"Shit, Karst. You got Amadeus. Good job, get inside,\" he says, pulling you inside. \n\n\nYou enter the war-room, to see various leaders working. Olive and Elizabeth are going over a map of the ship, Durge talks to a trio of badly diseased, rotting soldiers who shouldn't, to all you know of biology, be alive. Elios smokes a lho-stick in the corner, while reading a datapad. Elios notices you immediately, smiling.\n\n\n\"Drake Amadeus! Look who we've captured,\" he grins, walking over to you.\n\n\n\"Elios. You're...\"\n\n\nElios punches Drake in the side of the head, knocking him to the ground, grabbing him by the hair and yanking him up. \n\n\n\"I'll have him escorted to the cells, honey,\" Elios says to you, before turning and dragging Drake off. \"By the way, Johhny boy was looking for you.\"\n\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\n\"Me,\" the shaved, scarred man says, extending his hand. \"Captain Jon Hates, 22nd Istanford Regiment.\"\n\n\n\"What do you need?\" you ask, shaking his hand.\n\n\n\"We're moving out to capture a nearby armory to better equip our men. I could use a Psyker to edge the battle my way. You in?\"\n\n\n\"Sure,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"Do you need to re-equip or anything?\"\n\n\n\"No, I'm good.\"\n\n\n\"Let's bounce, then,\" Captain Hayes says, grabbing a lasgun from a nearby table and pushing open the door.\n\n\nYou move together along the hallways. The area around the old war room is sparse, having already been secured by the mutineers. \n\n\n\"So, did you join the regiment before or after they turned traitor?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I was there since the very first battle. I remember deployment. Here I was, fifteen, a lasgun clutched in my hand. The planet we were landing on was nothing but fucking jungles and rivers. We were supposed to wipe out the fucking rebels in the jungle, but they were fucking everywhere. But rebels, they're not shit. We could've taken out the rebels. Command didn't tell us there were Orks there. It turns out, we landed a few weeks after WAAAGH! Dazik hit. So we were caught in a three-way clusterfuck between Orks and guerrillas. That wasn't even the jungle. I swear to God, the Jungle was fucking sentient, and all it felt was hate. The beasts attacked us in our sleep, The bugs made us sick, it never stopped raining, the mud jammed weapons and the fucking enemy would not surrender. I was made Sergeant in two weeks. Two fuckin' weeks. I was fifteen, leading soldiers to war. We just kept fighting. Reinforcements didn't fucking come, aid didn't come, the wounded were left to die with us. The Imperium didn't give a flying fuck about us. The Emperor didn't. Everyone said it. The rebels were apparently supporting their war machine through smuggling and manufacturing drugs. Apparently, they used a lot of the plants on the world to manufacture combat drugs and narcotics and shit. Me and a few guys wiped out some smugglers, leaving us cold, tired and with a shit ton of drugs. We started targeting smugglers after that, the entire regiment. The men got a bit of pleasure in their lives, we used the combat drugs to increase our effectiveness, and fuck it, the smugglers were supporting the enemy! What was the issue?!\" \n\n\n\"Is he capable of shutting up?\" Meliodas complains.\n\n\nCaptain Hayes takes a long drag from his lho-stick as he steps over a mutated space marine's corpse, stepping on it's huge, elongated tongue with a squelch.\n\n\n\"So there we were, fighting on this world. One day, Commissar Denton talks a bullet to the throat. The dude was a nice fucker, solid, never did nothing wrong. He was happy to let us be, as long as we gave him a bit of puff and secured him a few complimentary visits with the local whores. The dude's killed, and we're sent a new Commissar. The first day we had him, we lost fifty men. Twenty from a suicidal charge he made us take on an enemy machine gun position we would've just wiped out with artillery if we had been smart. The other thirty? Kids. Kids, around the age I had joined. This had been seven years since we deployed, seven years of constant warfare. By now, I was Captain. Captain Jon Hayes. Sure, the kids fresh off the dropships were scared. We let them hide during the battles, 'til they were ready to fight. That fuckin' Commissar called them cowards and executed them all. We returned from the charge to find he had murdered our brothers. So, we iced him. Shot the fucker apart. Three weeks later, an Inquisitor showed up. Have you ever seen an Inquisitor?\" \n\n\n\"No,\" you admit. \n\n\n\"Just strangle him to death. Just do it. Shut him up. I've always been the most pragmatic one here, but it's just best if you trust him,\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"They're fucking scary. He showed up, and said that we were under investigation for heresy. The drug use, fucking native prostitutes, anti-Imperial beliefs, and killing a Commissar. He told us to surrender, so he could route out which of us were innocent, and which weren't.\" \n\n\n\"What did you do?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"No! Don't ask questions! He'll just keep talking, you fool!\" Meliodas cries.\n\n\n\"We killed him. We killed all the loyalists there, stole our drop-ships and headed to the skies. We stole a frigate, and got the fuck out of their. Soon, we got picked up by Kyros. We made a deal. People think Kyros' forces were all Chaos worshippers. Bullshit. Many of us were mercs, anti-Imperial rebels who just found ourselves with similar interests. A few of us were corrupted, but most didn't.\"\n\n\nYou arrive at a hastily set up barricade set up by Guardsmen. Two heavy bolters sit on the top of a dozen sandbags, with a dozen guardsmen crouched behind it, including a massive Ogryn, a mutant, gigantic, muscled subspecies of man, who holds a massive automatic shotgun.\n\n\n\"What are we doing napping, boys? It's early,\" Captain Hayes says, ducking under a bullet.\n\n\n\"We're pinned down. There's like a dozen Space Marines down the hallway in the ammo depot,\" one of the soldiers says. \"We've kept them from mounting a charge with the bolters and Frag grenades, but we need to resupply. We need more men.\"\n\n\n\"Do you see who this son of a bitch is?\" the Captain says, motioning at you. \"That's Karst, the psyker. He'll tear the enemy a new asshole in their soul so big we'll be driving a Baneblade up it. Understood?\"\n\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir,\" the men reply.\n\n\n\"Well Karst, care to give us a display of what you do?\" Captain Hayes says, motioning towards the Space Marines cloistered down the hall.\n\n\nYou march forward, psychic shields forming around you to bounce off their bolter fire. A marine wielding a flamer appears in the hallway, snarling in anger as he lets out a burst of flames. You narrow your eyes, flooding the man's mind with images endless bugs flying through the air and devouring his flesh. The marine screams, spraying fire all around him in an attempt to kill the monsters that only exist in his mind. You make a fist, crushing the flamer's fuel tank. The tank explodes, incinerating both it's operator and the men closest to him. You raise both your hands, fire and electricity running through your body as you let out a roar, filling your enemies mind with fear and dread.

Two thirds of the ship falls under command of the mutiny, although the bridge and several other key features are heavily fortified by Kyros forces, who stubbornly hold onto the ship despite the odds falling ot of their favor. They seem to be attempting to force a stalemate, by keeping the fight going until the failure to be able to restock the ship's supplies leads to mass starvation among the slaves and mutants vital to operating the ship, massive power loss from lack of fuel and an inability to make repairs to the ship.\n\n\nThe Bloody Claws are almost wiped out to the last man, their forces taking huge casualties in suicidal charges again the Black Rats, One Eyed Crows and Shrieking Harpies as Rebecca Staine attempts to wipe out her siblings for their betrayal of both her and Kyros. Although they are defeated and fail to take the heads of any Staine siblings, their fury and rage amplified a thousand times over by thee betrayal, fills them with the might of Khorne, and they reap a terrible harvest of skulls and blood, crushing the might of the Black Rats, One Eyed Crows and Shrieking Harpies. Rebecca Staine herself was killed in the fighting, her body retrieved from atop a pile of corpses, all of whom she had slain.The diseased, the mutated and the beautiful bodies of these war bands fill the hallways alongside the blood-stained Khornate warriors. Alongside the regular burden of facing he rest of Kyros' forces, the three rebelling Staine siblings have had their forces greatly diminished. \n\n\nWhile the Staine siblings' losses is a military failing for the mutiny, on a personal level it's a clear benefit. Their loss has put your Tribals, Goliaths and Gladiators as the most powerful force of the mutiny closely followed by the 22nd, so you'll have a lot more bargaining power among the mutiny leaders after the ship is taken. \n\n\nYou sit in the war room, Cain, Olive and Castus in front of you and Fay by your side.\n\n\n\"The Assault marines were stuck in the hallway when we fell upon them. It was a tremendous victory.\" Olive says. \n\n\n\"We kicked ass,\" Castus says, grinning.\n\n\n\"Terrific,\" you say. \"Anything else to report?\" \n\n\n\"Nothing of interest. We've been having some issues regulating drug use among the gladiators, especially combat drugs, but that's an issue for after we capture the ship,\" Olive says.\n\n\n\"Alright. Cain?\"\n\n\nCain steps forward as Olive and Castus leave.\n\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\n\"How did your assault go?\"\n\n\n\"It went well. We secured another hanger,\" Cain grunts.\n\n\n\"Do we have the ships?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"We got a lotta them. Not sure what types,\" Cain says.\n\n\n\"I know what types, I had a gear-head from the 22nd,\" Fay says. \"There are squadrens of Fury Interceptors, Starhawk bombers, Lightning Strike Fighters, Thunderbolt Fighters, Marauder Bombers, Valkyrie Transports, Vulture Gunships, Morrigan Devastators and Ranger scout ships.\"\n\n\n\"Why even ask what types? You can't tell a craftworld from a Hiveship, let alone anything else,\" Meliodas complains.\n\n\n\"Do we have pilots for them?\"\n\n\n\"Pilots for a lot of them, not all. We lost a lot of them in the initial fighting. We'll be able to replenish our supply of pilots from any high-tech worlds we come across, or we can train those we have, but short-term, we're out of luck.\"\n\n\n\"It's fine, we'll deal with it,\" you say. \"We'll have the ships outfitted to strike at Kyros' areas.\"\n\n\n\"No, don't be stupid. Most of Kyros' territory is deeper in the ship, so we couldn't do damage against them. Those that are along the surface either are almost ours and damaging them would be far too much work for us, or vital to the ship's function and can't be damaged,\" Fay replies.\n\n\n\"Fuck, good point. Make sure they're secured, though.\"\n\n\n\"Already on it,\" Fay nods. \"By the way, the Staine siblings want to talk to you.\"\n\n\nYou nod, turning and walking off towards the table where the Staine siblings are arguing. Elios quickly notices you and motions for his brother and sister to hush.\n\n\n\"Hello there, baby. We need to talk about the state of the ship.\"\n\n\n\"What about it?\" \n\n\n\"Well to be honest, the ship's falling apart,\" Elizabeth says. \"Serious damage has been done to the vessel. The forces under our command are incapable of repairing it.\"\n\n\n\"I assume you have a solution to that,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Of course,\" Elizabeth says. \"I just don't have many good ones.\"\n\n\n\"What do you have?\"\n\n\n\"We could attempt to patch it up as best we could, and try to make a Warp Jump to the nearest port. That will likely get us all killed,\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\n\"I could... help with that. Navigate with you a bit,\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"No,\" you reply, to both Elizabeth and Meliodas. \"We're not doing that.\"\n\n\n\"Well then, we need Magos Cern,\" Elizabeth says. \"She's holed up in the engine rooms. If we can capture her, she'll be able to not only repair the ship, but to help us get through Kyros' heavier defenses, and finally take this ship once and for all.\"\n\n\n\"You want me to capture Magos Cern?\"\n\n\n\"Correct.

You quickly force it open with a burst of energy. You rise up in the air, slowly squeezing yourself through the hatch. You collapse out of the pipe, falling onto the ground of a large room.

Unsurprisingly, they had a lot of technology; combat tentacles, tools, weaponry, which easily became mine. There's a certain poetic element when the Techpriests tear themselves apart, their machines separating themselves from the flesh once more. The camera's indicates that you'll be able to link up with the spearhead of your forces as they fight their way into Kyros' lair. You should arrive just behind the soldiers they are currently fighting. How fortunate. It seems to me the leaders of your forces are, to my, fighting in the actual battle and leading the charge.

I'll simply speak through my new speakers,\" Primus says. \"I'd quite like to feel my new form purged of the enemy. Go.\"\n\n\nYou nod, turning and jogging through the halls. You quickly break a sweat, and switch to levitating and flying along the has, inches from the ground, which takes relatively little energy.\n\n\n\"This way,\" Primus deep, monotone voice says from a speaker, and you turn to head down that hallway. \n\n\nYou quickly see what became of the Techpriests. Their cybernetic implants shake and move on the floor, beeping and buzzing as they continue slamming into their now bloodied, mutilated and dead owners. Suddenly, you hear a voice.\n\n\n\"Ah, my head hurts, and I'm an incorporeal being lacking a head. What the fuck happened?\" Meliodas says.\n\n\n\"Anti-psyker tech or some shit. Doesn't matter. We're fine now,\" you respond.\n\n\nSoon, after a few minutes of running, you come out of the hallway, finding yourself behind a heavy barricade of super-soldier space marines fending off the charging Goliaths, Gladiators, Tribals, Guardsmen, Chaos soldiers and your other allies. You walk forward, raising your hands as you clench them into fists. You fire a beam of energy and cutting an Undying Reaper in half. Chapter Master Taj Suenage turns, seeing you as you crush an Undying Reaper's skull.\n\n\n\"Karth!\" Taj yells, raising his war-hammer. \"End it now!\"\n\n\n\"You can join us, Suenage. Why are you loyal to Kyros? He's given you nothing but pain and torment.\"\n\n\n\"Pain and torment indeed. Why? Why did we betray the Imperium? Why did I betray the Emperor I loved so dearly? I tried to do what's right. Where has it left us?  The Undying Reapers are unhappy, without honor, and evil. I will follow Kyros into the mouth of hell itself, but only because it is hell we are going to. Did you think I expected to topple Terra? I am ready to die, tribal. But I will go like a Reaper, not a cur. Men! Do not touch Kyros! He is mine!\"\n\n\nTaj charges you, swinging his war-hammer.\n\n\n\"Yes!

Castus strolls forward, pointing his sword point at Taj's face before gently slapping him with the sword flat, as Goliath clutches a space marine's throat in his hands, strangling the limo body.\n\n\n\"General! Good to see you're alive! Having fun?\" Castus says, before kicking Taj in the head. \"Ooh, that feels good. Remember me, Tucker? I remember you. You and your boys had a fun habit of organizing gladiator fights so you could kill some poor fuck, some poor gladiator. Look where we are now, shitbag.\"\n\n\n\"Finish it, Karth! I know you want to! I wiped out your tribe! I killed your...\"\n\n\nYou clink your wrists, snapping Taj's neck.\n\n\n\"Goodbye, Taj,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Karth! Well done,\" Fay smiles.  \"Is Cern...?\"\n\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\n\n\"Good, no more tinkering. Glad that bitch is dead. Hope she suffered,\" Goliath grunts.\n\n\n\"We're heading to take out Kyros,\" Fay explains. \"I'd imagine you're all for that.\"\n\n\n\"Definitely. Let's go,\" you say.\n\n\nYou follow the group towards Kyros' chambers. Soon, you find yourself entering a massive doorway with huge steel doors, which are wide open. You find yourself at the bottom of a massive stairway. \n\n\n\"Stay back,\" you say to your companions. \"This is a battle of the mind. Your strengths and talent hold no power here.\"\n\n\n\"I'm not leaving you alone. You can't expect us to sit back and wait,\" Fay says incredulously.\n\n\nYou clench your hand, lifting her into the air.\n\n\n\"Hey, let me down!\" Fay says, kicking and struggling against the invisible bonds. \n\n\n\"See you soon, Fay,\" you say, forcing Fay to float outside the doorway. \n\n\nCain and Castus step outside of the doorway willingly. You flick your wrists, and the massive heavy doors slam closed. You turn, and begin climbing the stairs.\n\n\nAt the top of the staircase, four metal statues stand, forming a circle. One shows a bird man with a staff and ancient tome, cawing and firing a burst of magic out of the staff. The next shows a beautiful... person whose gender you can't tell, despite the fact they're half naked, smiling seductively at you. The next shows a massive, obese monster, covered in bile, boils and other signs of plague, looking to be in the final stages of dozens of different diseases. The final one is a horned beast-man, holding a massive battle-axe and in mid-furious, angered roar. In the middle of the circle kneels Kyros, waiting patiently. \n\n\n\"You took your time,\" Kyros says softly.\n\n\n\"I did,\" you say softly. \n\n\n\"Are the others dead? Taj and Cern?\"\n\n\n\"They're dead.\"\n\n\n\"I see,\" Kyros says, staring at the statues. \"I had the whole fucking Galaxy. I had a Gloriana-class battleship in my hands. A fucking Gloriana. Do you know how rare those are? How powerful?! This ship is worth more than a trillion of your pathetic lives!\"\n\n\nKyros roars, smashing his fists into the statue of Khorne the warrior, adding psychic energy to his attacks until he dents, breaks and eventually sends the statue toppling off it's pedestal. \n\n\n\"I had an army! An Imperial Regiment, all their vehicles, all their firepower, all their might! I had a Khornate war-band, a Nurglite war-band, a Slaaneshi war-band, a Tzeentchian war-band, a fucking space marine chapter, and more!\"\n\n\nKyros lets out a burst of fire, melting down the legs of the statue of Tzeentch the Sorcerer, turning into burning, molten metal that causes the rest of the statue to collapse and fall off its pedestal.\n\n\n\"I had two, fucking two army of super-soldiers. I had the capabilities to turn millions of recruits into super-soldiers that would've made the space marines look like PD-fucking-F!\"\n\n\nKyros stands by the bloated statue of Nurgle the Plague-Master, and presses the palms of his hands against it. A wave of rust begins running through the statue, as it begins to rust and crack, before breaking and toppling to the ground, smacking into the metal floor with a hollow thud. \n\n\n\"I had powers that could've made the galaxy tremble! We could've conquered the galaxy! I had you, a powerful ally who could've helped me conquer the galaxy!\"\n\n\nKyros lets out a powerful, shrieking roar that overwhelms your senses, causing you to stumble backward. The roar causes the legs of Slaanesh the Hedonist to shatter, as the statue tumbles off and smacks into the ground.\n\n\n\"We would've toppled the Imperium of Man and thrown the Emperor off his throne! We could've liberated trillions from the religious persecution, slavery, persecution and fascism that's being inflicted! We could've brought man to a new level! But you weren't willing to make sacrifices! You had to rise up with the rest of the greedy traitors, unwilling to work for the Greater Good! You took everything from me!\"\n\n\nKyros turns to you, his eyes full of an anger and a hatred unknown to you. \n\n\n\"I lifted you from the dirt! I made you what you are! I gave you everything! You think I'm going to roll over and die?! I'm going to send this entire vessel, my vessel, headfirst into the Warp. I'm going to let this entire ship be taken by daemons. Why not? The only men loyal to me have been slaughtered. I'll let daemons slaughter the lucky ones. The unlucky, which given the strength of your soul will no doubt include you, will pluck the souls of their choice off and let them experience the ravages of the Warp and then to feed on your suffering.

You both levitate into the air, your hands wrapped around each other's throats. Kyros knees you in the stomach, before sending you hurtling into the floor. You slam into it, curling up and forming a protective shield around yourself just as your \"mentor\" unleashes a wave of psychic energy. As soon as the last shudder of energy finishes, you release a burst of electricity that shocks Kyros, who howls in pain. You release a long burst of flames, engulfing him as he howls in pain. Kyros swings a lash of energy that you sidestep, before firing a beam of light that catches him in the chest, knocking him to the floor.\n\n\n\"I'm the superior fighter,\" you say.\n\n\nKyros raises his hands up, which begin to crackle with psychic energy. You feel your head pulse with the currents of the Warp. You grab a chunk of broken metal, instantly funneling heat into it as it begins to grow a bright red. He flings it at Kyros, catching him in the shoulder, sending him to the ground. You fire balls of plasma from your finger tips, which Kyros only barely manages to stop.

Do not bother me in a time like this! We are on the brink of discovery! We have a mind older than the Emperor himself. Fifteen thousand years old! Can you imagine the knowledge it holds? Prepare Primus for start-up. I believe now is the time. I must just play with Kyros' pet's flesh, and then we will work.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Magos. Understood, Magos.\"\n\n\nThen, you lose all resistance and sleep takes you, leaving you powerless in its dark embrace.\n\n\nYou awake an unknown time later, lying on the metal operating table. Magos Cern stands over you, washing her implements in a basin of water. She looks at you, her cold, red eyes peering into your soul.\n\n\n\"Ah, you're awake. Good,\" she says.\n\n\n\"What did you put into me?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The biology of what I did is beyond you, flesh bag.\"\n\n\n\"Can you dumb it down for me?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Could one reduce concertos to the mumbled grunts of mutants?\" Magos Cern asks indignantly.\n\n\n\"Please?\"\n\n\n\"Fine. I increased the size of your heart by 40% and lungs  by 12%, and added several veins and arteries leading directly to the brain from the heart. These actions increase the blood flow to your brain, and should hence increase psychic abilities. I added multiple microchips that breed monocytes, other white blood cells, platelets and other helpful things for your body. That was the bulk of my work. Other than that, it was just a medical check-up.\"\n\n\n\"OK,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I have a lot of important work to do, now. You should've had enough time to recover.\"\n\n\nTwo of your massive space marine guards arrive, a roaring face on their thick helmets.\n\n\n\"Here you are,\" Magos Cern says. \"Guards, make sure to walk slow. If at any point the patient starts puking blood, let him sit down for ten, maybe fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\n\"Shouldn't you keep him hearing for observation, then?\" one of the guards ask.\n\n\n\"I have far too much work to do,\" Magos Cern says. \"Don't disturb me. If anything goes wrong, go to Genetor Corivan. He is very experienced with medical matters.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the space marine says.\n\n\nMagos Cern quickly heads off, walking off to a row of elevators. The space marines stare at you, and you climb out of bed with a groan.\n\n\n\"Ah, my head,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You should have headaches for the next 48 hours,\" Magos Cern shouts, right before she disappears into an elevator. \n\n\nYou stand, feeling a rush of blood hit your head. You walk after the space marines, along halls and up and down elevators, until you find yourself in the arena. Castus and Olive are there, mid-battle with each other.\n\n\n\"Oh look, it's tweedle-dum and tweedle-fucking idiot,\" Meliodas says. \"Not even a laugh? Oh wait, you didn't grow up with nursery rhymes, you're from a Feral world. My bad.\"\n\n\nCastus swings his sword at her, while Olive swings her rifle-axe up at his head. He rolls out of the way, kicking Olive's foot away and sending her to her knee, before booting her in the head. She collapses down, before rolling out of the way to avoid a downward stab by Castus. She grabs Castus' sword handle and punches him. Castus falls backwards, before taking up a fighting stance. Olive begins circling him, her gun-axe at the ready. She spots you, smiling.\n\n\n\"Karth's here,\" she says.\n\n\n\"Bullshit,\" Castus says, readying his sword.\n\n\n\"Karth, tell him you're here,\" Olive says.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm here,\" you say. \n\n\nCastus turns to look at you, but Olive charges, swinging her gun-axe. She knocks the feet away from Castus, dropping his knee down on Castus stomach. Castus grunts before Olive grabs her gun-axe and holds it to Castus throat.\n\n\n\"Dead,\" she says.\n\n\n\"No fair, we were supposed to stop when Karth got here,\" Castus says.\n\n\n\"You're still dead,\" Olive smiles, standing up.\n\n\nCastus grabs Olive's wrist, pulling her forward so his sword pokes into her stomach.\n\n\n\"Dead,\" he smiles.\n\n\n\"Seriously?\" Olive says, rolling her eyes. \"Fine, I'm dead. Are we finished yet? The kid needs training.\"\n\n\n\"Fine,\" Castus shrugs. \"Let's start it.\"\n\n\nCastus draws a dagger from his belt, staring at it. The blade is a bright silver, with an odd pattern etched into it. It's handle is a bright, light blue, with a short, silver horn coming from the end of the handle.\n\n\n\"Now, this is an absolute beauty. I really don't use it enough, so it's yours. Xenos-origin, so even owning it is heresy. The blade is razor sharp, it could cut through flesh and bone easier than it could through air.

You fly forward, smacking into the operating table and onto the ground. You let out a pitiful moan, before Cain puts his massive foot on your head.\n\n\n\"What orders do you have for me?\" he asks.\n\n\nCain attempts a triumphant yet terrifying smile. The corners of his mouth twist unnaturally high, revealing rows of serrated teeth, curved fangs, massive molars and many other weird, odd teeth, protruding from bloody, rotten gums.

He's either going to slit our throats or send us on an endless string of suicide missions. We need to do something, and I really need your help. A group of collaborators have planned to rise up, and rid ourselves of Kyros. Then, we take over. I need the support of your Tribals to do so.\n\n\n\"Yeah, totally. Done.\"\n\n\n\"Done?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah. If we don't escape, we die here. Also, they're your Tribals as much as mine. Who else is in on this?\" Fay asks.\n\n\n\"Elios, Durge and Elizabeth are all in.

Castus and Olive behind us, we'll have bargaining power. So you're in?\"\n\n\n\"I'm in,\" Fay nods. \"I'll have the message spread among the tribals.\"\n\n\nYou notice one of your guards walking towards you, carrying a tray. You motion for Fay to quiet down, as the guard arrives putting the tray down on the table.\n\n\n\"Eat,\" he says, in a cold voice like the scraping of a blade on rusted metal.\n\n\nYou look at your food. There's a bowl of noodles and strips of thin, cured meat, a small bowl of green jelly with chunks of odd, alien fruit inside, a large plastic cup of wine and a small, dense biscuit-like cake.\n\n\n\"Well, someone's being pampered,\" Fay says, smiling.\n\n\n\"Clearly I'm just more important than you,\" you gloat as you have a forkful of noodles and meat. \n\n\nFay grabs the biscuit cake from your tray, taking a bite.\n\n\n\"Hey!\" you say in annoyance, as Fay sticks her tongue out.\n\n\nYou quickly eat your meal, polishing off the entire tray and gulping down the wine. Then, Magos Cern arrives.\n\n\n\"Good, you've eaten,\" she says. \"These operations will be safer if you've had a full stomach.\"\n\n\n\"OK, I'm ready, let's go, you say. \"Bye, Fay. See you soon.\"\n\n\n\"See you later, Fay says, looking a bit sullen, as you wonder whether that put down was too forward.\n\n\nMagos Cern leads you out of the cafeteria and along the halls, off along halls and elevators. Eventually, you pass through the cyro-sleep section, arriving in a large operating room. Dozens of Goliaths are lying on the surgery tables, many halfway through surgery. A half dozen other Tech Priests wander around between the Goliaths, removing and adding flesh, bone, organs, cybernetic implants and other strange things.\n\n\n\"I didn't know there were other Tech Priests,\" you note.\n\n\n\"This ship is the size of a small moon. Did you think you've seen enough of it to accurately be able to say that we don't have something? I have scores of Tech Priests who followed me into the embrace of the Dark Gods,\" Magos Cern says.\n\n\nMagos Cern leads you to an operating table.\n\n\n\"This is yours. Please get undressed and wait here, I need to grab my materials and equipment. Stay here.\"\n\n\nMagos Cern turns around, walking off, leaving you alone. You spot Cain, lying on his operating table, his chest cut open to reveal still functioning organs. You wonder how he can still be alive with such a hastily cut-up torso, before you wince as you see his eyes dart towards you and you realize he's conscious. Looking to see Magos Cern hobbling away, you hop off the operating table and walk over to him.\n\n\n\"Commander Karth,\" Cain grunts. \"Need something?\"\n\n\n\"I have... an offer.\"\n\n\n\"An offer? An offer of what?\" Cain says, absent-mindedly picking at a cut alongside his... or at least, one of his stomachs.\n\n\n\"Freedom,\" you say, catching the monster's attention.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" Cain says, furrowing his scarred brow and causing a thin stream of blood to pour from his horns.\n\n\n\"We're planning an escape. We could use you and your men,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\n\"Elios, Durge, Elizabeth, Fay, others,\" you say. \"That's it, I think.\"\n\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\n\"We don't have details, yet. We need a head count before we can start planning it.\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm... I'm willing to give you control of my... \"Goliaths\", as you called them. But, I have a list of conditions that I want to be satisfied once we take the ship.\"\n\n\n\"Go on,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I want us to get names. Every Goliath who is capable of remembering and answering to a name will be called that instead of its serial number, by you and ALL other members of command. No more cyro-sleep. I want a bed for every single Goliath. I don't care if it's fine cloth or a slab of concrete, as long as it doesn't freeze them, it'll do us. I want free time that's not just killing.\"\n\n\n\"Anything else?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"That's it,\" Cain says, spitting out a serrated teeth that's fallen free from his jaw. \n\n\nCain's demands are far from unfair. Really, all he wants is slightly more rights for his Goliaths, which wouldn't even take any more resources. Still, you don't want the beast getting a big head. You ARE still in charge of not only his collar, but the collars of every single Goliath. All you need is a few threats, and the Goliaths will be yours.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}, {"action": "Disagree", "result": "\"No.\"\n\n\n\"No?\" Elios says, taken aback.\n\n\n\"I'm not joining you. He knows what you're planning. I'm not joining your death trap.\"\n\n\n\"So be it,\" he says, a sneer forming on his face. \n\n\nElios steps forward, knocking on the metal door. The guards open, immediately raising their bolters. Elios waves his hand.\n\n\n\"You didn't see me here. The voice of Slaanesh calls you, and you're his now. Move aside, and tell no one I was her,\" Elios says, strolling forward, leaving without looking at you.\n\n\nIn the next few weeks, you're quickly proven right. Elios is first. When he's found, he's had his limps slowly sanded off, before being thrown in a pit with mutants who tore him apart. A \"mysterious\" assassin attempts to kill Elizabeth, but Durge fends her off, only for a \"malfunction\" to destroy him the next day, incinerating him in a single blast. Elizabeth is killed by one of the ship's macro-cannons, taking out the shuttle they were going on, because of a sensor malfunction identifying it as hostile.\n\n\nWith his threats to power gone, the assault on the Imperium is on. The first few worlds fall with ease, as they're unprepared for the level of firepower that Kyros is bringing to the table. Still, issues arise. You're reinforced by those recruited from the conquered realms as well as throngs of war-bands coming to join your invasion. Still, Kyros gets greedy. He attempts to take on a Forge World, a world literally covered with layers of factories, run by the cyborg-engineers that are part of the machine-worshipping cult known as the Mechnicus. Kyros' grand plans to have a Forge World producing endless war machines are ruined when the planet's orbital defenses take out much of your fleet, and in the ensuing battle the factories are leveled. When Kyros finally takes the planet, it's nothing but a smoking rock.\n\n\nEverything falls apart after that. In a desperate attempt to capture geneseed stores to allow him to take over the home world of a Space Marine chapter known as the Horned Kings. The chapter is wiped out, but again Kyros gains nothing as the last act of the Chapter Master is to detonate their geneseed stores. \n\n\nAt this point, Kyros' forces are a pale shadow of their previous selves. Cain and most of the Goliaths were taken out as their landing pods were wiped out in an attempt to take the Forge World, and the gladiators are wiped out by a suicidal charge by the Iron Kings. They're not the only ones gone. Fay is killed, along with many of the tribals, in the Genesee stores' destruction. It's only at that point that you truly stop caring. Your tribe is gone, only a few faces so grief-stricken you can barely recognize them remaining. You don't care if you reach Terra. You don't care if you live. You don't care if you die. You just don't care, about anything. \n\n\nYou find yourself on some war-stricken world, killing. Scores of refugees are wiped out as your hand waves and warpfire spurts from the earth. Once, you would've have wanted to hurt innocents. You wouldn't have done it. Now, you feel nothing as you smell their cooked flesh. A Space Marine charges towards you, but you stare at him. The Space Marine screams as you force him to tear his own arms off, tossing them aside and having tentacles rapidly grow out of his arm sockets, before his mind is corrupted and he charges, roaring towards his allies as he begins to tear them apart. You  watch as a Dreadnought's legs buckle under your telekinesis, sending it toppling and tumbling down before it explodes. You levitate a Guardsman into the air as he howls in terror, be...\n\n\nThe earth shutters as artillery booms, sending you into the air. Artillery tears through the earth, and you slam into an APC. You hastily stand, to see dozens of refugees piling out of the crippled APC. You see to your surprise Tribals shooting at you and the other refugees, bullets thudding into the metal next to you, before they're killed by bolter fire. You look at your reflection in the half-broken window of a destroyed building, and realize why they were firing. With your now torn clothes and dirt-covered face, you are now indistinguishable from the refugees you've been killing.\n\n\nYou hear a dozen monstrous roars from your allies off towards your right, signifying a charge, before it's answered by the shouts of the Imperial Guard and Space Marine preparing a counter-charge. You could try to escape this. Hide amongst the refugees. Find a way out of this life. But what would be the point? You hear the charge nearing. Damn Kyros, putting you in this situation. Maybe you should be the one to finish his mad invasion? Or maybe you should return to what you know, and fight?", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack the Space Marines and Imperial Guard", "result": "Fear the Psyker\n\n\nYou turn, to see dozens of colored, heavily armored bodies making a charge.

From then on, it's a blur. Warpfire flies from you in a whirlwind of flaming death. Psychic electricity runs along your wrists and melts bone, fries skin and takes life. Bolts of energy take out any stupid enough to near you. You take fire, though. You dodge most, shield yourself from most of what remains, but a few get through. By the end of this, blood pours from your wounds and you feel the life drain from you. You continue fighting, breaking and shattering all those before you. Your life has become a blaze, burning all that nears to cinders. Like a blaze, it begins to blaze out. Eventually, you find yourself on your knees, continuing to wipe out dozens of your enemies, though lacking the strength to stand up. You let out a final roar, releasing a burst of psychic energy, before your soul is violently rendered from you.\n\n\nAlthough Kyros takes the planet, his forces are nothing more. They take two more worlds before being wiped out as the Ultramarines, Bronze-born and Lead Vipers wipe them out to the last man. Still, Kyros name is barely known.

You release waves of warpfire and psychic energy, killing dozens of people around you, but that's just a side-note to your main foe. You slam into Kyros, wrapping your hands around his throat. You begin to crush his throat, screaming, as Kyros immediately begin to activate your collar, strangling the life out of you. You don't care. You feel your trachea explode, but you don't care, you only keep strangling. As the two of you fight, you release waves of psychic energy, killing scores of men around you. You let out a scream, transfering all your energy into your hands, and Kyros screams in pain and terror, before you tear his head clean from his head.

We can cause some minor trouble, a riot or two, kill a few guards at best. That leads to them just shutting off our dorms and pumping these rooms full of chlorine gas. We stay seemingly loyal, do what we're told, and wait. Eventually, when we have the chance, we strike. They won't expect it, and we'll have waited until the perfect opportunity. Then, we escape. Then, we gain freedom. Then, we gain a future. Got it?\"\n\n\nThere's hushed responses, as the tribals take a hopeful, inspired look. They won't rebel. They'll follow orders... for now. As soon as the chance rises though, you'll have a loyal group of soldiers to fight alongside you.\n\n\n\"Tell the other tribals. We need to stick togther\" you say to the tribals, before turning to Fay. \"We should go.\"\n\n\nYou walk out of the room, with Fay at your side, holding your hand.\n\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you took my suggestion,\" she says, smiling sweetly at you.\n\n\n\"Well, you're clever, so I should listen to your advise every once in a while,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"Stop teasing,\" she says, lightly hitting you. \"We all know how this relationship works. You're the brains, I'm the brawn. Not the other way around.\"\n\n\n\"Well, how come I can easily push you around?\" you say, flicking your wrist and sending Fay onto her rear.\n\n\n\"Hey!\" she says.\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" you say, laughing.\n\n\n\"You're a massive dick,\" she complains, as you lift her back to her feet.\n\n\nYou stop, the smile going from your face as you see Kyros walking quickly towards you.\n\n\n\"Ah, here you are. Is the issue resolved?\"\n\n\nYou nod, trying not to let him see you gulp nervously.\n\n\n\"Good. Now, we need to visit the last of your soldiers, the gladiator-slaves. They're always an interesting crew.

I lifted you up from the dirt! I gave you power! I gave you a future! I gave you all a future, and now you want to betray me?!\" Kyros screams, standing up. \"I won't let scum like you kill our chance at greatness! Loyal brothers, wipe them from the face of the earth!\"\n\n\nIn an instant, everything goes to hell. Kyros puts your collars on full, and your collar tightens incredibly. You feel your throat be crushed and the air run out as you helplessly grab at it, watching the carnage. Calpurnia stands, raising her bolt pistol, but Rebecca leaps up, driving her sword through Calpurnia's chest, killing her instantly. Elios moves with incredible speed, drawing a hidden blade and slicing open Taj's throat as the space marine attempts to raise his bolter. Then, Magos Cern sprays boiling gasoline from a pipe in the side of her head into Elios' face, burning him severely before she stands, driving a drill into his burned face as he falls backwards. Durge struggles to stand with his immense wait, but immediately moves forward, standing in front of Elizabeth in an attempt to shield her from Kyros' wrath.\n\n\n\"Elizabeth, get out of here!\" Durge says, as a panicked Elizabeth gets out of her seat. \n\n\n\"Durge, you miserable, plague-infested prick. You're going to die. You think you can save your sister? I'm going to cut off your spike-arms and drive them into both her eyes and then give her to the troops for a bit of fun.\"\n\n\nDurge roars, charging forward. The scene goes fuzzy as the lack of oxygen hits your brain and you feel your throat being crushed. All you see is the massive, blurry blob that is Durge explode, collapsing backwards, just as Elizabeth disappears, no doubt having teleported with some psychic ability she has. Kyros screams, but by now you're on the line between conscious. You reach a hand out, finding Fay's as she dies on the ground next to you. You hold her hand tightly as she squeezes back and the last bit of life leaves you.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, null]}]}, null]}, null, null, null]}]}, null, null]}, null, null]}, null, null]}]}]}, null, null]}]}, null]}, null, null]}, null]}, null, null, null]}]}, null]}, null, null]}]}, null]}]}, null]}]}, null]}]}, null]}, null]}]}]}]}]}
