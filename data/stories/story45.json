It was right by the motorbike that your friend was about to show off.\n\nYou didn't really think much of it, not even asking your friend about it at first since it was probably your eyes just playing tricks on you, it was pretty dim after all.\n\nIt was wasn't until you got closer.\n\nThe facial features, the blood, the bent limbs and the wriggling maggots that were feasting around its mouth and what was left of its nose.\n\nYou don't remember all that much after that.\n\nYour dad told you that you had to be sent home since you wouldn't stop screaming or crying, when he reminisced the story to you he found it amusing.\n\nKnowing what you do know, you didn't find it funny.\n\nYou didn't really fear it all that much either though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Present day", "result": "There seemed to be a difference in the dead you saw.\n\nSome were alive and could communicate with you, while others were just corpses that you would see as if the crime or accident had just happened, sometimes the corpses would seem very decayed too, just like the one at your friend's house.\n\nAt first, it was just it was just corpses that you were able to see, which really fucked you up when you saw them every now and then at different locations whenever you left you left your house. The first times you screamed, as far you can remember or have been told by your parents, but soon it seems you just got used to it as no one else were able to see what you kept on seeing. It didn't scare you as it did the first times after encountering new corpses, but then again it wasn't a sight that you looked forward to seeing either.\n\nYou could best describe it as getting sick, or getting injured. It sucks when it happens, but you can't really do all that much about it, and the only way around it is to limit yourself in the locations that you went. That's how you ended up becoming a shut-in, locked away in your room on your computer for whenever you came home from school or had free time on the weekends.\n\nThat's to say you weren't an emo loner or someone who had terrible serious issues that needed therapy, or at least you hoped so.\n\nThe screaming parts were just seen as a phase to your parents. Like sex or bad words, seeing dead people was something that you never really felt comfortable talking about with them.\n\nIn fact, at first, you thought everyone could see it, and they were just fucking with you when they said that they had no idea what you were talking about when you pointed at the corpses. It took months before you knew that it was just your own personal disease.\n\nA disease that you knew would probably never get cured.\n\nWaking up from bed, in a tired daze, you looked at your phone to see that it was Friday, and you had woken up an hour early before school. This was pretty unusual, since most of the time you would stay up till one or two a.m. and would usually miss the morning bus.\n\nThat had to mean you only got like four or five hours of sleep.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nTaking the time that you had, you got yourself showered and dressed and went downstairs to make yourself some breakfast before you would walk to your bus stop.\n\nYour school was close enough that walking could be an option.\n\nAlthough usually, you run into a few car crash victims along the sidewalk, most of the time their heavily disfigured or heavily weeping.\n\nYou don't know exactly why you didn't notice them when you were younger, though you chalked it up to the assumption that you were always playing on your Gameboy on car rides or something.\n\nThere have been a few instances in which you've spoken to the dead, although most of the time they never ended well.\n\nIt seems that they're trapped into a sort of box, each box differentiating in size to reasons unknown to you. If they're lucky they have someone to talk to if the place they died has another ghost, or they died in pairs. When there's a lone ghost, however, most of the time they look miserable or heavily distressed.\n\nYou learned never to make eye contact, as that was a sure fire way that they knew that you could see them. There was one time that one on a road you traveled on was screaming at you, and that had caused other ghosts in the area to also look over at you as he screamed that you could see him.\n\nYou don't ever go on that road now on the way home, in fact, you stay try your best to stay away from that part of the city.\n\nThough there a bit of you that was ashamed for being afraid of ghosts.

Usually, there had to be at least one every block or so, though this was probably the reason why you preferred this so much instead of walking.\n\nBesides you, there was only one other student who got on at this stop, though he usually kept to himself in the corner of the wall as he huddled down to his knees and checked his phone until the bus was to come. You thought about saying something a while back when you first started riding the bus but thought against it for reason.\n\nAs the two of you waited in silence as the sun slowly rises in the distance changing the dark blue sky into a lighter hue by each passing second, the bus soon finally arrives as the two board the school bus.\n\nYour stop was one of the first ones on the route, so you had the first choice in seats. With only three other people on, and none of them being someone you knew, you sat alone in the midsection.\n\nYou disliked sitting next to windows, for obvious reasons. The less you saw of the corpses the better.\n\nToday you felt worse than the past couple, probably was something that you had eaten or something. Resting your head against the back of the seat in front of you, you kept your hand against your stomach as you tried to remain calm. Fuck you should have asked your mom to stay home today, you already knew you were to vomit soon enough.\n\nStrangely you didn't notice time pass as you kept to your thoughts, and before you knew it the bus was crowded with most of the stops now being completed. The noise was rampant as you felt like you were getting to your breaking point, fuck this would be so embarrassing.\n\nYou were lucky that no one was sitting next to you today, because of this you turned your back to the aisle as you rested your head against the window.\n\nArriving at school, you were one of the last ones to get out, luckily the bus driver was just playing a game on his phone so he didn't all that much mind that you took your time getting off.\n\nImmediately your first thought was to head to the nurse's office, but with how far it was from the bus lanes, you knew you wouldn't make it.\n\nWith your alternative being much, much closer, you decide to head there instead to get some solitude to do the disgusting deed.\n\nYour knees trembled as you planted them to the ground while lifting up the toilet seat. Something felt extremely weird, the feeling of your upcoming vomit fest was accompanied by a strong heartburn. You don't remember eating anything spicy that would have caused something like this but whatever was coming out, would most likely burn your throat.\n\n\"Hnph, Hmpfhh!\"\n\nA steady stream of brown water exits your mouth as it all enters the toilet in one big gush. It didn't seem like this would be ending anytime soon, as more continued to be projectile streamed from your mouth.\n\nAs this was happening though, the heartburn got worse, and your eyesight was starting to become a blur in which you couldn't even see the dirty water of the toilet clearly anymore.\n\nWith the last of the vomit exiting your body, you fell back onto the tile floor and went into immediate darkness.", "action_results": [{"action": "Dreams", "result": "You dream a lot when you sleep.\n\nIn fact, you could probably remember all of them from the past week, in almost exact detail.\n\nAlmost all of them involved ghosts, and almost all of them had unhappy endings.\n\nYou couldn't really classify them as nightmares though, just sad stories.\n\nThis dream wasn't like the last ones. The giant marble pillar that you sat on in a dark purple empty void was a brand new experience. This, this seemed and felt like a nightmare. Your surroundings felt so vast and unknown and because you had extreme anxiety and awareness for what could or was about to come.\n\nThe voice that came a few minutes after, raised every single hair on the back of your neck and arms while your fingers clamped up.\n\n\"Your quota needs to be met. You need to pass one five.\" These words were repeated twice in the same speed and vocal. You felt as if someone was watching you but as you looked around there was no one to be found. The voice sounded so alluring and calm, but also one that would be able to cause great things, and with that, it also intimated you greatly.\n\n\"Diligence will reward you. Diligence is the key to pass them on.\" These words were repeated as well, and once they were done both were said compounded.\n\n\"Good luck.\"\n\nYou could hear the sound of the final late bell for class as your eyes opened to the ceiling of the bathroom. Groggily sitting yourself up and wiping the drying vomit from your mouth with your shoulder sleeve, you get yourself to your feet as you grab your bag and flush the toilet.\n\nYou didn't know what the words of your dream meant, and if you should actually take it seriously at all.\n\nWhat mattered right now though is that you just fucking fainted after throwing up.\n\nYou were feeling better but there was still an aching burning sensation in your chest that was starting to worry you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to class", "result": "This was probably some sort of morning sickness or something, it would probably end up passing during third or fourth period. Besides it's not like you walked or did anything active during class anyway so worst comes to worse you can just lay your head down and wait for it all to be over.\n\nExiting out of the bathroom, you shuffle down the empty hallways as you navigate to your homeroom. Mr.Finks was pretty laid back when it came to being late so it's not like you would get into much trouble anyway because of this predicament.\n\nFinally arriving in the hallway in which your class was located, you open the door leading inside, feeling the stares of some people as they give you a quick look before going back to whatever was occupying them seconds before your arrival.\n\nYou go over to where your seat is as Mr. Finks notices you but doesn't say anything towards, probably assuming your ride brought you here late or something. This makes you a bit glad as you slump down into your seat as Mr. Finks starts with today's morning lecture on what we would be doing for the period.\n\nClasses go by at a regular pace for you as you walk from one to another with each passing hour. Your stomach sways from normalcy to shitty pain every now and then which in turns gives you a piss poor attitude with anybody that interacts with you.\n\nDuring lunch, you didn\u2019t feel like eating anything, which worried you since you hadn\u2019t eaten at all today besides a banana for breakfast, which you probably threw up in the bathroom earlier. Most likely whatever you were to take in would immediately come right back out, so you decided to opt out from your normal lunch plans. You instead decide to go somewhere secluded, and find the solitude in one of the hidden areas behind the school were a nice patch of grass and a few benches could be found. Normally this is where couples would usually make out and such, but ever since they increased security around campus and added a camera here, it\u2019s become abandoned by students save for rare occasions.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even sit on the bench and instead plopped your whole body on the grass. Immediately it started feeling better, and you\u2019ve never felt such bliss of having a painless stomach. You just looked up at the light blue cloudless sky while your stomach just gurgled from hunger and bits of pain.\n\nThe quietness of the whole area seemed off, with it being school and all. Normally there would at least be ambiance of wildlife or janitors emptying trash cans, but it was just silence.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been laying there?\u201d\n\nYour whole body jumped up in surprise at this sudden voice from behind you, as your body immediately pulled itself up. Your torso turned to look at this intruder of your quiet time, to which you saw a female student giving you an odd look.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d You say with a hint of venom, which you instantly curse yourself for doing.\n\n\u201cYou know it was pretty hard to find you when there were so many souls blocking my signal, you being alone though in a place like this just so happened to make the first part of my job extremely easy.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You say with a confused look for what was just said to you.\n\nThe girl sighed with annoyance.\n\n\u201cNow I guess we have to do the boring stuff don\u2019t we...you can see ghosts right. Don\u2019t lie to me either.\u201d\n\nYour mouth hangs open as unintelligible sounds come from it as you don\u2019t know how to respond.\n\nA smile appears on her face as she bends down onto her knees to get a better look at you more closely, which in turns startles you even more.\n\n\"Do I know you?\" You hesitantly ask.\n\n\"Probably not, I usually end up leaving early since I'm a senior so you probably haven't seen me around all that much either. But anyway now that my suspicions are correct it's time to get down to business before lunch ends.\"\n\nThis girl was being very vague with what she was telling you, and you felt like just walking off to leave her and her crazy thoughts to her lonesome.\n\nHowever she knew that you saw ghosts, and curiosity dominated over your cautiousness, so you ended up staying sitting down and for her to explain herself further.\n\nBefore she began, you see that she took a big breath before anything left her mouth and then she started.\n\n\"Your kind, the kind who sees ghosts are referred to as Wardens. Wardens help ghosts in different ways, and Wardens are categorized in different subs depending on how they help ghosts. You have been categorized into the trapper subsection congratulations, you get one of the most fun jobs there is. You can refer to me as your guide, I'll help you with finding easy ghosts, and in turn well both finish our contracts and bounce out of the quota system for five years until we're needed again.\"\n\nA lot of what she said didn't make sense, and there were a few parts that just passed you completely.\n\n\"Well delve into this topic more, we have some time to spare so we can leave to helping spirits on the weekends. Which I honestly prefer because I don't want to waste my senior year doing this crap, even if it can be fun at times.\" She says this with a small smirk while look at her cluelessly.\n\n\"Until our quota is done, I'm going to be your new best friend for the next couple of months, so let's get this over with as soon as possible. Anyway, give me your phone number so I can start getting you some more information after you go home because this the more extended stuff that you need to know is a real pain in the ass to have to say.\"\n\nYou didn't really respond, as what she had just said went in through one ear and out the other.\n\n\"Hey are you deaf, give me your phone number.\" She said a little more irritated.\n\nComing back from your daze, you fumble your phone from out of your pocket, bringing up your number on the contacts page as you seem to forget what it is. Giving her your phone, she quickly starts typing in what she needs before giving it back to you seconds later.\n\n\"Also don't call me to me around school like you know me, that'll be weird. My name is Ruby.\" With her quick introduction, she walks away from where you're sitting with everyone seemingly said and done.\n\nYou continue to sit in that lonely patch of grass as you wonder what the hell had just happened.", "action_results": [{"action": "Later that day", "result": "With school over and you heading over to your bus stop, you wait there quietly as you and some other students idle around until it is time for it to arrive.

The passenger window rolls down and seeing who the driver is makes your mouth drop a little.\n\n\"Hey, hurry up and get in!\" Ruby yells while pointing directly at you.\n\nThe other bus riders look at you while you immediately follow her directions and get into her car.\n\nAs you close the door, Ruby begins to chastise you.\n\n\"Holy fuck didn't you get my texts to wait at your last hour so I could come and get you, I was looking all over for you around campus.\"\n\nReaching into your pocket you pull out your phone and see that you had a couple missed calls along with over ten spam texts.\n\n\"Ah sorry my phone was dying so I was saving my battery, don't know why I didn't feel the vibrations th-.....Wait why am I here with you again?\" You stop yourself and ask her with confusion.\n\n\"Trust me, me I had plans to go do other shit to and I'd rather be doing that right now, but I just got a lead on a couple of spirits that you'll be able to take in, and the sooner we do that the sooner we can end the quota and length the time before we start getting sick. Always keep that in mind when I start pulling you out from classes or we go somewhere straight from school. So start checking your phone sooner dipshit.\" With her lecture and insult out of the way, she puts her car in drive and speeds of the school driveway and out onto the streets.\n\n\"What did you mean by take in?\" You ask in puzzlement at the first stoplight you meet.\n\nRuby looks at you with confusion, before realization sets in.\n\n\"Oh yeah I wasn't planning on explaining your powers until later over text, but I guess now is going have to be the time we do this. Alright listen and pay attention because I'm not going to repeat what I'm about to say, got it?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Alright, so each one of your kind has a special power that is used in dealing with spirits and helping them ascend. Some powers are faster with the process than others, while some just go off on their own branches and ways that they can be used. Your specialty is a rarer one, and to be perfectly honest I don't even know how exactly we're going to go about doing this as I have no idea how your kind ascends spirits. But for now I need you to coax these spirits we encounter into a state of comfort, afterward you'll take them in.\"\n\n\"Take them in how?\" You ask again, this time a little tenser.\n\nThis cause Ruby to grimace a bit as she seems to choose her wording wisely which surprises you a bit given her past attitudes of being upfront.\n\n\"Well....Take in as in literally, the spirits we encounter will enter your body alongside you and sort of stay there, seeing what you see, communicating with you, and just being apart of you per say without much control over your body though.\" She finishes, giving a quick glance over to you for your reaction.\n\n\"Wait a minute, you're telling me I'm going to be sharing my body with those fucking things!\" You say a bit louder than you meant, but with good reason as this was a pretty serious matter.\n\n\"Relax, you'll still have total control over your body, well I'm pretty sure you will. I've never heard of one of your class being taken over so I can't say for certain...but anyway all that'll really happen is that you'll just have other people talking to you in your head is all, or maybe they show up as actual spirits. I don't know your guess is as good as mine, so make sure to fill me in on what happens with our first contact. I'll be needing this information in case I ever have to work with another one of your kind.\"\n\nYou couldn't really tell if she was trying to reassure you or calm you down from your anxiety, but if she was, she was doing a really shitty job at doing so.\n\n\"Anyway...who's this first ghost were going to go....see?\" You ask Ruby while your throat tightens a bit.\n\n\"Well according to the tip, it's going to be a be a young boy who died while drowning, luckily his spirit boundaries included the docks so he wasn't stuck at the bottom of the lake forever, still though, getting out of there must have been hell...\" She says with a small pause.", "action_results": [{"action": "The lake", "result": "You remember coming to this lake before. When you were much younger as a child with a couple of your cousins during a summer weekend. You hadn't realized a kid had drowned here, but then again you wouldn't be surprised as there were some pretty deep parts of this lake that could be really dangerous if you were by yourself.\n\nRuby parked in the area in which a playground was located, though it seemed to be barren, though with school having just ended a little while ago that was probably a given. The two of you exited her car as you made your way down the hill towards the lake that was at the bottom of the large park that is mainly occupied.\n\nThere being a lot of people fishing around here when you were younger, but a few signs that seemed to be banning such sport placed along the path down to the lake seemed to tell you that there was no more of such a thing around here. You have a guess that it probably had to do with more people swimming around this area causing the ban, though honestly you would have seen it as the other way around.\n\n\"Let's hurry up and get this done before anyone decides to come down here and take a dip, apparently when you take in ghosts the process is a little....weird,\"Ruby tells you as she gets into a faster pace on the way down the hill. Thanks to those words the feeling of your stomach churning in her car earlier had returned just as it had died down only moments before.\n\nUpon arriving at the lower wooden docks in which were used as jumping off points, you see no one there which surprises you a little, as you had at least expected to see the boy in plain view.\n\n\"Ah fuck where did the little shit run off too...\" You hear Ruby murmur under her breath in a not so subtle way.\n\nThe two of you look around for the ghost boy but come up with nothing which leads to Ruby getting more irritated.\n\n\"Fuck, if he's at the bottom of the lake right now then this is really going to be a pain in the ass to do...you know how to swi...HOLY SHIT.\" Ruby recoils back instantly, pushing yourself back in the process as she was right in front of you. You catch her with your hands before she can trip the two of you over and push her to the side a bit, to be able to see what shocked her so bad.\n\nYou see nothing at first, which confuses you. It isn't until your vision starts lowering to the shallower parts of the water that you also recoil back a bit, but not as much as Ruby had. There in the water, a half-submerged head sits. Its forehead is covered with wet hair that hides most of it. The thing that fucked with you and Ruby though were the pair of yellow pupils that were looking directly at the two you ominously. The only other part that wasn't submerged was its upper nose, everything else of its head and body was under.\n\n\"You little fucking shit, why'd you scare us like that!\" Ruby yells with fury at the boy, who in turn cocks his head to the side, revealing some of its mouth and nostrils, which all seem to be rotting, as none of its skin is the normal color one would think when imagining a person. Everything about him was a sickly vomit green, the worst part though was some of his skin seemed to be sagging at different parts of its face, no doubt from the water.\n\n\"Ruby approached the figure in the water, as she went down the dock. This caused the boy to get himself out of the water using his two hands to hoist his body out.\n\nWhen he did though, Ruby stopped in her tracks, and your stomach started churning violently as you tried to stop yourself from vomiting.\n\nThe boy had no lower body so to speak, it seemed to stop at his stomach, and with how to skin met the flesh at the bottom, it had seemed as if though he was ripped apart violently, as entrails leaked out, but were sturdy enough to stay on him with his swaying motions as he kept balance with his hands onto the docks. His entrails reminded you of tentacles on an octopus, except dark red and green along with some black shit mixed between that you didn't want to guess on it being.\n\n\"Fuck...\"Ruby mutters under her breath.\n\n\"What do you want?\"The boy says, with a super unearthly voice that you swear echos like that of someone possessed by a demon.\n\n\"We're here to help you cross over kid, so help us help you.\"Ruby says getting straight to the point, although she isn't as confrontational and rash as she was before, not even able to look directly at the boy.\"\n\nThis causes the silence from the boy, but through your peripheral vision, you see that his eyes start to furrow in anger.\n\n\"What are you some kind of devils or something, was this my punishment, sitting at the bottom of the lake for four months trying to dig my way out! Fuck you!\"\n\nThis boy had quite the vocabulary of words for someone as young as him.\n\n\"Trust me kid, do you know how many people die each and every day and get stuck in this limbo, count yourself lucky that you haven't been waiting years, hell you might even be considered early,\"Ruby tells him with a sideways glance. It seemed as if the boy took this the wrong way though as if Ruby was mocking him, as this only seemed to increase his anger.\n\n\"You fucking bitch! Do you have any idea how long a month can be at a bottom of a lake, how murky and dark it can be. Do you have any idea how long I was dragging myself until I reached the embankment that started to take me up? Unless you can relate to that don't fucking joke about time, you know nothing of it.\" The boy seethed through his teeth.\n\nRuby scoffed at this as she stepped closer to the kid.\n\n\"Alright listen here kiddo, you can be mad all you want, what's done is done so why don't you start worrying about your future. Do you want to stay at this lake forever and not move on? If you keep us with this attitude we can just leave you here and you can wait for another one of us to come and find you, but trust me, you'll be waiting a lot longer than four months.\"\n\nThe kid through his furious expression turns away to stop making eye contact with Ruby as he starts to shudder. You can see the tears falling from his remaining eye as he just shakes his head slowly. He stays silent after that.\n\nRuby walks back to you as she crosses her arms.\n\n\"Ok, well this is going to be harder than I thought due to what just happened, but everything else is going to be up to you. You have to get the kid to agree to come with you, but the trick is he has to be happy, or just content I think, afterward were done with this one and we can move on.\"\n\n\"You know you could have been a little nicer with him you know.\" You reply with a frown.\n\nShe laughs at your complaint, and with how real it is, it un-nerves you a bit.\n\nShe puts a hand on your shoulder and looks you dead in the eye. \"Trust me, once you start dealing with enough of them, you'll eventually get jaded out. Besides most of them are going to a better place after this, so don't worry to much about it.\"\n\nLetting go of your shoulder, she walks away and goes to sit down at the other end of the dock, and just seems to watch you.

From now on it's just going to be you and me interacting with one another. Trust me I'm a lot nicer than she is.\" You say with a little laugh.\n\nThis causes the boy to look up at you, and the two of you make direct eye contact. You try to morph your facial expression to that of an assured and friendly one, you think it's working as the boy doesn't break eye contact with you.\n\n\"What's your name kid?\"\n\n\"Owen.\"\n\n\"Well Owen, how would you like to come with me. I can get you out of here in the next couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"You'll help me get to heaven?\" Owens' eyes beam with home, but as he reads your unchanged expression his mood darkens.\n\n\"I'm going to hell aren't I?\"\n\n\"What? No, it's just that.....well you won't be going to heaven just yet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean...?\"Owen asks suspiciously.\n\nYou give a sigh.\"Alright look kid, I'm going to be straight with you. I'm going to perform an action and after this action. Well,.....you're going to go inside my body.\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Yeah, you'll share a body with me, and be able to see what I see and go where I go, think of it as keeping me company.\" You say trying to make situation sound tame.\n\n\"But I don't want to go with you, I want to get off this fucking planet!\"He cries.\n\n\"Yes eventually you will, but you just have to stay with me for a period of time, and once that period of time is over, you can ascend.\"\n\n\"How long is the period of time...?\"He mutters.\n\nYou give him a sideways glance. \"I don't know, it depends on the spirit.\"\n\nSilence clouds the two of you as he seems to think this over.\n\n\"Well...I guess it's better than staying here I guess, now that the fishermen are all gone. You don't seem like all that bad of a guy either so I guess it wouldn't be all that bad, compared to that one bitch...\" He mutters.\n\nEven if he was to agree with the terms of coming with you, you still had to bring some happiness into him somehow, otherwise, the process wouldn't work going off of what Ruby had said.\n\n\"Don't look so down about it kid.

Sitting in silence for a few seconds, you start to feel the static die down a little as your ability to hear yourself think finally.\n\nHello?\n\nYou hear a voice call out to you, which makes your entire body jump up a bit with how it sounds directly in your mind.\n\nOwen is that you?\n\nYeah, it's me. Man this is so weird, I can see what you're seeing I think, but I can't control where my eyes go, I can't explain it\n\n\"Hey, so did it work then?\" You hear Ruby ask you as she starts walking up to you from where she was sitting.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess. He's in me now.\"\n\n\"Well that's amusing, hopefully, that counts to your quota in terms of delaying the sickness for the both of us, anyway I guess were done here now that you have him. Before we go though you should test some of your abilities out.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by abilities?\" You asked puzzled.\n\n\"I looked up on your specific class on my database while I was sitting down over there, and apparently you and your spirits can do some specific things together.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"We'll first off he can detach from your body, apparently you're now his boundary zone, so he can stay around you in his own form if he doesn't want to stay inside your head so to speak.\"\n\nAsk her how to do it!\n\nOwen speaks loudly causing you to wince.\n\n\"Well how is it done then?\" you ask Ruby.\n\n\"Tell him to just start thinking about leaving your mind, while being absolutely calm and patient, that's how they said to do it on the database.\"\n\nThat sounds easy enough.\n\nSeeing as that you didn't have to do anything yourself, you waited for Owen to do the process of getting out.\n\nNothing seemed to happen for a few moments, but a voice from behind you made you jump from behind.\n\n\"Hey, it worked!\"\n\nTurning around you see Owen, although this time, he had legs. Not just legs, but his entire body was completely different, he had regained his eye, and his skin was that of a normal healthy color. His whole body looked normal, as if he wasn't dead at all, this would be the first time you've ever seen a ghost this healthy looking. Owen didn't seem to notice this at first, but he soon looked down in puzzlement and let out a yelp as he stumbled back on his feet.\n\n\"My...My legs are back!\"\n\n\"Yeah, now I can actually look at you without vomiting...\" Ruby mutters from beside you.\n\nYou give her a glare as Owen continues to feel up his body for all the body parts and skin that he had regained.\n\nOnce again, tears started falling down his face as he continued feeling himself, although more slowly than before.\n\n\"The other trick is getting back inside your body, and for that, all he has to do is grab your hand and twist it, those are the only tricks I've found so far, I'm sure there's more, I'll let you know once I find them,\" Ruby explains to you as she starts to walk off.\n\n\"Now let's get out of here, I have to get home and do my homework.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Home", "result": "Ruby had dropped you and Owen off at your house.

Though you decide now to ignore to unless you're alone somewhere or with Ruby.\n\nDuring your classes, Owen gets bored and decides to start running around the room, getting into people's faces and other sort of shenanigans. You had warned him before you went into class though that he was not to touch anything that would look like something supernatural to everyone else. He had promised not to, but with the half-assed way he had said it, you didn't all that much trust him.\n\nBecause of this, you couldn't pay attention in class as your eyes were continually trained on Owen to make sure he wasn't doing anything stupid. There were even times in which he would give you evil glares and pretend to start throwing things, which would make you panic a little in which he could probably tell, as it made him laugh.\n\nFuck, maybe it would be better if you could just keep him in your head.\n\nWith your first set of classes over and lunch starting to begin, you wait to see if Ruby wants to meet with you so you stick by your class.

Or maybe she's waiting for you to go and find her.\"\n\nYou continue to ignore him.\n\nThis seems to frustrate Owen a bit, as he stays quiet for the remainder of the time that you are in line.\n\nOnce you grab your food and head on outside, out of earshot from everyone else, Owen starts to speak again.\n\n\"OK, no one's around you can talk now.\"\n\n\"Shut up Owen...\" You mumble.\n\n\"You talked!\" Owen says with excitement, though in a mocking tone no doubt.\n\n\"Anyway, what do you want to do for lunch today?\" Owen asks you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Library", "result": "When Ruby had brought up the powers in which you had with Owen, it never really left your mind as you continued to think about it every now and then.

Though she worded it in a really weird way as if she was expecting something bad to have happened.\n\nOn the second week, Ruby had given you forewarning of another spirit that the two of you would be meeting on the weekend. She had tried to push it during lunch on Friday, but you had persuaded her out of it since you weren't really up for skipping.\n\n\"So then that means someone else is going to join us?\" Owen asked you when the topic had been brought up in one of your conversations during lunch.\n\n\"Yeah seems like it, which is kind of good since you're pretty boring to talk with one on one.\" You tease.\n\n\"Fuck off.\" He laughs off with a smirk.\n\nWhen the weekend finally comes, Ruby comes by your house to pick you up early in the morning as you've already told your mom you would be heading out for the day and maybe coming back at night.\n\n\"So who's it going be?\" Owens asks in the backseat as Ruby gets onto the freeway.\n\n\"It's going to be an older man actually, like really old. I can't tell if he had just died recently or the others had just forgotten to help him ascend, if it's the second one then at least it'll be easier to take him since he would already be broken.\" Ruby explains although an awkward silence fills the car with what said with the last part.\n\n\"Where's he going to be at?\" You ask Ruby in order to change the subject a little.\n\n\"It's going to actually be at an old abandoned home. Apparently, the man owned it and died there alone, the house hasn't been bought yet which makes our lives a whole lot easier.\" Ruby explains as she merges onto a new lane.\n\n\"So it's going to be the same process as last time, with what I did with Owen?\"\n\n\"Yep, but I expect you to do it faster and more efficiently this time now that you've had the experience.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes at that as the car ride remains quiet for the remainder of the trip.\n\nThe house in which this spirit was located seemed out of place compared to the commercial buildings surrounding it. It was also weird that its driveway merged onto an avenue, which seemed to be super inconvenient for anyone living here.\n\nAs the three of you exit the car, Owen is the first one to run up to the door and try to open it.\n\n\"It's locked!\" He exclaims.\n\n\"Well, of course, it is you dip, why wouldn't it be.\" You reply causing his to give you a dirty look.\n\n\"Wait does it mean we're going to break in? That's so cool!\" He says towards Ruby, who nods her head.\n\n\"Wait I'm pretty sure this is illegal, I don't want a cop to pull up on us breaking in.\" You tell Ruby who is digging through her book-bag for something.\n\n\"Relax pussy, where going to be in and out of here in no time, besides it's not like we're going to break a window or anything, a squatter recently was here and I found out that he leaves the back window open him to get in and out.\"\n\n\"How could you possibly know that?\" You say, feeling as if she was totally bullshitting you.\n\n\"Your job is to catch the ghosts, my job is to make sure it all goes smoothly.

The only actual reason that I'm still with you is that we both go to the same school so finishing this quota can be done in a lot less time than it usually takes. I'm only doing this for convenience, not a necessity, you best remember that.\" With her rant over, Ruby starts to make her way around the house as you stand there with your butt clenched at what she just said.\n\n\"Damn, she really got you there.\" Owen chimed in as you just notice him standing next to you.\n\n\nThe two of you followed Ruby into the house as she easily opened the window letting all three of you gain entry.\n\n\"Alright follow me and don't fucking touch anything, I don't want any traces that we were here if we can avoid it.\" Ruby orders as she starts walking up wooden stairs that are placed in a narrow room. When all of you get up to the second floor, Ruby seems to know immediately where to go as she starts directly walking to a lone door at the end of a long hallway. It didn't seem to work properly though, as merely pushing open the door lightly caused it to move back with ease.\n\nTaking a peek inside for herself, Ruby looked back over to you and ushered you inside, before closing the door once you were in with Owen.\n\nThe room was empty, not a single piece of furniture could be found, but that could be said with most of the house anyway, besides random piles of trash and boxes. A single window could be found here but the blinds were only letting in a few rays of sunlight, giving the room an eerie atmosphere that wasn't helped by the spirit standing alone in the corner of the room, staring at you directly. You didn't think you would ever get used to this.\n\n\"Um...Hello?\" You say, in hopes that this would be a friendly spirit.\n\nThe spirit gives a slight nod at you, but that's about it.\n\nThe spirit in it's form, seemed very oddly different compared to what Owen had looked like. The immediate distinction above all else though was the blue glow that emitting from it's entire body. It had no markings of decay whatsoever, but at the same time it didn't look human. It looked as what one would imagine a spirit were to look, a form of energy in some sorts.\n\n\"What's your name mister?\" You ask, trying to be polite.\n\n\"You can call me Nick, boy.\" The spirit since in an asserting type of tone.\n\n\"Well Mr. Nick, do you know how long you've been here?\" You ask, trying to get all the basic questions out of the way.\n\n\"Well I've lived here my entire life, and it seems after it as well, so if that answers your question.\"\n\n\"I mean how long has it been since you've passed?\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean that...Well, I don't really seem to remember. Could have been days or weeks. Probably less than a month though by my guessing.\"\n\nEven though Ruby had already told you this stuff, you still wanted to ask the spirit these questions to see how much they knew and if they were lying or not.

We should be able to finish this process rather quickly.\"\n\n\"What would this process entail?\" Nick asks.\n\n\"I would need you to agree to the terms of entering my body for an unspecified amount of time. Even I don't know how long you'll be with me, but trust me when I say that it won't be anything bad, in fact, it'll probably even be better than staying here. Wherever I go you'll be able to go, and you'll be able to have a little bit more intractability with the world.\" You explain to him, trying to make it sound as easy as possible.\n\nNick takes seems to take this in for a moment, before nodding his head.\n\n\"If that's the case then I really see no reason to object then, let's get this out of the way, the sooner I can get my sleep the better.\" Nick states.\n\nWow, this would be way faster and easier then it was with Owen, if the older aged spirits were this upfront with wanting to leave and with the questions you asked, then you should totally be helping a lot more of them out. Regardless of that, you extend out your arm for Nick to grab.\n\n\"Please grab my arm, Nick.\"\n\nNick does as you say as grasp arms.\n\nClosing your eyes, you start to twist your palm around Nicks' arm as the familiar feeling you had first felt with Owen starts to happen once again. Although this time you don't feel as weak as you did, which is good, though your stomach still hurts quite a bit.\n\nAs the tingling feeling starts to subside, you see that Nick stands before you, seemingly a bit confused.\n\n\"I felt something happen I think, but did something happen?\" He asks.\n\n\"Yeah it isn't really a big change honestly, you just aren't tied down to this house anymore, and instead have a boundary around me.\" You explain to him.\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\nYou look over at Ruby to get confirmation over your success to which you see her already standing up.\n\n\"I knew this spirit wouldn't take that long to bind with, I've been on a roll with this is so far, anyway that should be enough spirits for you to bind with for now. Let's go home, I've had enough ghost hunting for one week.\" She yawns before starting to walk out of the bedroom.\n\nYou were really surprised and relieved that you didn't really need Owen's help for this spirit, but you also felt a little shamed seeing that Ruby probably had a big part in why the spirits you were encountering didn't really put up much of a resistance when it came to coming with you.\n\n\"Let's go home then, I wanted to finish my playthrough of fallout I just started on your computer.\"\n\nShaking your head, you leave the room and follow Ruby downstairs with Nick and Owen.\nYou were really hoping she meant what she said about there being no more spirits for you to take in, any more and it would most likely start to get really crowded in your room, besides all it took was for some ghost with a nasty attitude to really mess with things if you had to spend every minute assigned with them, that's why you were really glad that Ruby wasn't a spirit that was chained to you, that would be horrible.\n\nRuby was quick to drop you off, Owen and Nick were even a bit worried about how fast she was driving at some sections, but luckily you made it home safe and sound. After getting to your room, Owen immediately hopped onto your computer and started playing Fallout, while Nick grabbed something from your bookshelf and began reading. Hopefully, these guys wouldn't be bored anytime soon, as you had no idea for any other way you would entertain them.\n\nA bit tired from everything that had happened, you decided to just sleep off the remainder of the day, hoping to sleep in well since it was the weekend.\n\n---\n\nMonths had passed since you first took in Nick into your circle. Since then you had also taken in three more ghosts, a teenage girl who had committed suicide by the name of Ashley, a middle-aged gangster type man who had been killed in a gunfight named Baron, and lastly there was a younger tween-aged girl who was killed while jaywalking named Veronica.\n\nWith each new spirit, you continued to tell Ruby that you couldn't accept anymore since it was starting to get to crowded, though you had to word it carefully since all the spirits were in close proximity. Each time she would tell you that you would be ascending everyone soon, though each time you just got a new spirit to take in. While most of them weren't really a problem in dealing with, since if they got too rowdy you would make them stay in your head, it just became such a hassle whenever you needed privacy to yourself. Luckily Owen was really talkative so he drove the attention away from you as he was always the center of attention.\n\nThe quietest out of everyone would have to be Baron, he didn't really speak all that much when you first brought him in, and only really ever talked if spoken to. Ashley was probably the loudest as she kept on complaining about still being here and not in a final resting place, or at least she was at first, now she's quiet like Baron but still gives off a strong negative attitude whenever she speaks.\n\nOwen and Veronica got along the best, probably since they were both around the same age save for a few years. Though still, they were very loud whenever they would get too excited, which led Ashley to start screaming a few times for them to shut up as she spent quiet time in the corner of your room.\n\nYou were really glad that you had actually gotten Nick into your circle since he was the only real functioning adult here who could set his foot down causing everyone else to listen and stop whatever it was they were doing whenever he said something of importance.\n\nThere was no way you could take anyone else in, the next spirit Ruby tries to throw at you you'll just put your foot down and say no. Half of the spirits assigned to you already want to leave and get ascended too, Ashley and Nick especially, although Nick seems to have gotten comfortable around everyone, to which he stopped asking Ruby about the ascension less and less as time went on. To be perfectly honest the only real problem was Ashley, she just kept pulling on your nerve strings whenever she opened her mouth. You actually just thought about keeping her in your mind so she wouldn't have to argue with anyone, but you felt as if that would just lead to more problems.\n\n\nThe other major thing that you had to keep track off was when you went to classes. Owen tried to show off to Veronica a few times by doing stupid shit in class like touching peoples shoulders or dropping pencils. Naturally, he knew you couldn't do anything about it so your anxiety just kept on increasing along with antics. It got to the point in which you would force him to stay in your mind for the remainder of school. Though to counter this he would constantly try to annoy you in your head so you couldn't pay attention to anything at all. You've told him off plenty of times, probably a bit harsher than one would be to a kid at such a young age, and sometimes he would get into long pouts about it.\n\nAs cool as Owen could be at times, he was really pushing you over his edge, just so he could get interest from Veronica, who gave mixed signals towards him which only made shit worse. You could swear that you were starting to get grey and white hairs from all this stress.\n\n--\n\n\"I already told you, you're going to be ascending soon now stop bitching!\" Ruby seethes as Ashley confronts her yet again after school.\n\n\"Bullshit it's already been months and we're still fucking here, I stopped believing you after we took Veronica in. Take us out of here NOW!\"\n\nAshley seemed to be really going at it this time, you've never seen her talk out this long, usually, she starts to brood in a corner after yelling or complaining for only a few seconds.\n\n\"Is it my fucking problem that you decided to kill yourself? You should of thought about the shit that could happen before you made such a stupid ass decision.\"\n\nVeronica and Owen cringed and flinched back a bit, while Nick turned his head. It really was about to go down.\n\n\"YOU FUCKING BITCH!\"\n\nAshley charged towards Ruby with fury, though as you predicted she flew right past through her due to her emotions.\n\n\"Yeah nice try fuck face, now anyway before I was so rudely interrupted, I was going to say that I'm going to get you all ascended by the end of this month, and I'm serious when I say this. Our quota is going to be due soon, and if things go right, I might have something special in store for us.\" Ruby finishes, looking directly at you when she said the last part.\n\n\"Don't do anything stupid or dumb until then while I get all the preparations in place, and after that, you all can get your eternal sleep or whatever the fuck it is you want and we can all be happy. Now I have to go, I have a club meeting that starts in an hour.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Home", "result": "Upon getting home, Ashley got in her usual corner, though she was much more upset looking than usual which could be easily understood why. Nick went over and started talking to her quietly, while Veronica and Owen got onto your computer in which you now could almost never use. Baron sat himself down in one of your spare desk chairs and just placed it by one of your windows, and just stared outside which was his usual activity.\n\n\"Ashley please, I guarantee you she means it this time, trus-.\"\n\n\"No! It's not about that. The stupid bitch brought up my suicide again. Don't you think I regret it Nick, each day I'm stuck here I keep on thinking about it. If I knew this was waiting for me instead of what I dreamed of then I would have stayed alive for as long as I could, at least I had the freedom to do what I wanted.\" Ashley interrupted him with tearful cries.\n\nMan Ashley's reasoning's were pretty annoying, you hated when she got loud like this because of the stuff she said hardly made any common sense.\n\nSitting down on your bed, which was probably the last refugee you had in your room, you started going through your phone as you had already completed classwork at school. In fact you got a lot done now ever since Nick first joined, turns out he was really good at math, and would instantly remember the lessons that were taught to you as he reheard them, during your free-time for homework, he would kneel beside you and help you with problems as you whispered any questions to him.\n\nBaron might have had some knowledge too, as he was only the only other one who actually paid attention to your classes, although he never spoke up and you've never been bothered to ask.\n\nGoing through messages, you saw a notification from Ruby for a message that had been sent twenty or so minutes ago that you forgot to open.\n\n'Hey don't tell those dweebs, but I might end up pushing the ascension up even earlier,I really want to get it out of the way for some reason, reminds me the fuck out how much Ashley bitches about it. So just get ready to do it on a Thursday or Wednesday in the next two weeks if need be. I'll give you the rides as usual.'\n\nThank fucking Christ, though you were a little irritated that she only bothered doing this because of someone else. Besides that the quicker you got these guys to ascension the better, while you were still on good enough terms with most of them.\n\nThough you don't know why she didn't want any of them to know, the news itself would probably calm down Ashley enough for her to stop moping so hard. Unless of course, Ruby was bullshitting you again and what she just told you was a load of crap.\n\nMan you really felt so negative for the past couple of weeks, you needed something to blow off steam before you really went over the edge and snapped or something. Getting these guys out of the house too would also probably raise their spirits. Though you hadn't really gone out and did something since you watched that movie three weeks ago, in which Veronica and Owen ruined when they started making shadows near the projector, to which no one could tell where it came from except for you. You felt really bad for the couple that was sitting in the back that got the blame for it.\n\nWhen everyone seemed to look very bored in your room, was the time you gave them the news.\n\n\"Alright, since this is the last month we'll all be together, I've decided that we should all go out and do something fun. Any suggestions?\" You ask them all.\n\n\"Oh let's go see a movie!\" Owen immediately suggested.\n\n\"No suggestions from you or Veronica.\" You immediately sternly reply.\n\n\"What why? She was the one who did that stuff at the theater it wasn't even me!\"\n\n\"You're such a liar!\" Veronica replies while pushing Owen.\n\n\"Cunt!\"\n\nOnce again they start to go at it.\n\nYou try your best to ignore them though as you continue taking suggestions from everyone else.\n\n\"I'd like to go hiking,\" Nick says.\n\n\"Baseball game...\"Baron says next, which surprises you a bit.\n\nLooking over at Ashley, she doesn't seem to be paying attention all that much.\n\n\"I don't care what you guys do...\"\n\nWell that was it then, you had your two suggestions.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hiking", "result": "You didn't know how much tickets were to go the earliest baseball game this or next week, and you didn't really want to spend all that much money since you were basically broke as it was.\n\n\"Alright then, I guess we're going hiking.\"\n\n\"Sweet, I've like going to the mountains, my dad found an arrowhead one time when we went really far out!\" Owen brags to everyone.\n\nEven though Baron didn't get his suggestion, he still nods in approval while Gwen still doesn't really seem to give much of a shit.\n\n----\n\nThis was really going to suck if you were the only one who was going to get tired out of this.

We should be able to finish this process rather quickly.\"\n\n\"What would this process entail?\" Nick asks.\n\n\"I would need you to agree to the terms of entering my body for an unspecified amount of time. Even I don't know how long you'll be with me, but trust me when I say that it won't be anything bad, in fact, it'll probably even be better than staying here.

Regardless of that, you extend out your arm for Nick to grab.\n\n\"Please grab my arm, Nick.\"\n\nNick does as you say as grasp arms.\n\nClosing your eyes, you start to twist your palm around Nicks' arm as the familiar feeling you had first felt with Owen starts to happen once again. Although this time you don't feel as weak as you did, which is good, though your stomach still hurts quite a bit.\n\nAs the tingling feeling starts to subside, you see that Nick stands before you, seemingly a bit confused.\n\n\"I felt something happen I think, but did something happen?\" He asks.\n\n\"Yeah it isn't really a big change honestly, you just aren't tied down to this house anymore, and instead have a boundary around me.\" You explain to him.\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\nYou look over at Ruby to get confirmation over your success to which you see her already standing up.\n\n\"I knew this spirit wouldn't take that long to bind with, I've been on a roll with this is so far, anyway that should be enough spirits for you to bind with for now. Let's go home, I've had enough ghost hunting for one week.\" She yawns before starting to walk out of the bedroom.\n\nYou were really surprised and relieved that you didn't really need Owen's help for this spirit, but you also felt a little shamed seeing that Ruby probably had a big part in why the spirits you were encountering didn't really put up much of a resistance when it came to coming with you.\n\n\"Let's go home then, I wanted to finish my playthrough of fallout I just started on your computer.\"\n\nShaking your head, you leave the room and follow Ruby downstairs with Nick and Owen.\nYou were really hoping she meant what she said about there being no more spirits for you to take in, any more and it would most likely start to get really crowded in your room, besides all it took was for some ghost with a nasty attitude to really mess with things if you had to spend every minute assigned with them, that's why you were really glad that Ruby wasn't a spirit that was chained to you, that would be horrible.\n\nRuby was quick to drop you off, Owen and Nick were even a bit worried about how fast she was driving in some sections, but luckily you made it home safe and sound. After getting to your room, Owen immediately hopped onto your computer and started playing Fallout, while Nick grabbed something from your bookshelf and began reading. Hopefully, these guys wouldn't be bored anytime soon, as you had no idea for any other way you would entertain them.\n\nA bit tired from everything that had happened, you decided to just sleep off the remainder of the day, hoping to sleep in well since it was the weekend.\n\n---\n\nMonths had passed since you first took in Nick into your circle. Since then you had also taken in three more ghosts, a teenage girl who had committed suicide by the name of Ashley, a middle-aged gangster type man who had been killed in a gunfight named Baron, and lastly there was a younger tween-aged girl who was killed while jaywalking named Veronica.\n\nWith each new spirit, you continued to tell Ruby that you couldn't accept anymore since it was starting to get too crowded, though you had to word it carefully since all the spirits were in close proximity. Each time she would tell you that you would be ascending everyone soon, though each time you just got a new spirit to take in. While most of them weren't really a problem in dealing with, since if they got too rowdy you would make them stay in your head, it just became such a hassle whenever you needed privacy to yourself. Luckily Owen was really talkative so he drove the attention away from you as he was always the center of attention.\n\nThe quietest out of everyone would have to be Baron, he didn't really speak all that much when you first brought him in, and only really ever talked if spoken to. Ashley was probably the loudest as she kept on complaining about still being here and not in a final resting place, or at least she was at first, now she's quiet like Baron but still gives off a strong negative attitude whenever she speaks.\n\nOwen and Veronica got along the best, probably since they were both around the same age save for a few years. Though still, they were very loud whenever they would get too excited, which led Ashley to start screaming a few times for them to shut up as she spent quiet time in the corner of your room.\n\nYou were really glad that you had actually gotten Nick into your circle since he was the only real functioning adult here who could set his foot down causing everyone else to listen and stop whatever it was they were doing whenever he said something of importance.\n\nThere was no way you could take anyone else in, the next spirit Ruby tries to throw at you you'll just put your foot down and say no. Half of the spirits assigned to you already want to leave and get ascended too, Ashley and Nick especially, although Nick seems to have gotten comfortable around everyone, to which he stopped asking Ruby about the ascension less and less as time went on. To be perfectly honest the only real problem was Ashley, she just kept pulling on your nerve strings whenever she opened her mouth. You actually just thought about keeping her in your mind so she wouldn't have to argue with anyone, but you felt as if that would just lead to more problems.\n\n\nThe other major thing that you had to keep track off was when you went to classes. Owen tried to show off to Veronica a few times by doing stupid shit in class like touching peoples shoulders or dropping pencils. Naturally, he knew you couldn't do anything about it so your anxiety just kept on increasing along with antics. It got to the point at which you would force him to stay in your mind for the remainder of school. Though to counter this he would constantly try to annoy you in your head so you couldn't pay attention to anything at all. You've told him off plenty of times, probably a bit harsher than one would be to a kid at such a young age, and sometimes he would get into long pouts about it.\n\nAs cool as Owen could be at times, he was really pushing you over his edge, just so he could get interest from Veronica, who gave mixed signals towards him which only made shit worse. You could swear that you were starting to get grey and white hairs from all this stress.\n\n--\n\n\"I already told you, you're going to be ascending soon now stop bitching!\" Ruby seethes as Ashley confronts her yet again after school.\n\n\"Bullshit it's already been months and we're still fucking here, I stopped believing you after we took Veronica in. Take us out of here NOW!\"\n\nAshley seemed to be really going at it this time, you've never seen her talk out this long, usually, she starts to brood in a corner after yelling or complaining for only a few seconds.\n\n\"Is it my fucking problem that you decided to kill yourself? You should have thought about the shit that could happen before you made such a stupid ass decision.\"\n\nVeronica and Owen cringed and flinched back a bit, while Nick turned his head. It really was about to go down.\n\n\"YOU FUCKING BITCH!\"\n\nAshley charged towards Ruby with fury, though as you predicted she flew right past though her due to her emotions.\n\n\"Yeah nice try fuck face, now anyway before I was so rudely interrupted, I was going to say that I'm going to get you all ascended by the end of this month, and I'm serious when I say this. Our quota is going to be due soon, and if things go right, I might have something special in store for us.\" Ruby finishes, looking directly at you when she said the last part.\n\n\"Don't do anything stupid or dumb until then while I get all the preparations in place, and after that, you all can get your eternal sleep or whatever the fuck it is you want and we can all be happy.

It's not like you were planning on telling anyone about your powers anyway, though this still messed with you immensely.\n\nG- Anyway this explanation has tired me, I'll brief you tomorrow on any spirits that need your help, but until then just relax and pat yourself on the back for all the fun you're about to have, because believe me you have no idea how hard I'm going to ride your ass to get this quota done, I've got shit to do so the sooner we do this the better.\n\nYou finished reading her last passage, and after a few moments, you saw that everything that had been written in the notepad was being deleted rapidly until there was thinning left a minute later.\n\nAs you contemplated your situation with your hands clasping your head, you felt a buzz in your pocket. Taking out your phone, you see a new message from an unknown number, with an area code foreign from your state. It came from the United States though that much you could tell.\n\nG- ^_^ Don't go off calling me, this is just to send you information about spirits.\n\nYou frowned heavily at this message, which leads to another one.\n\nG- What did I tell you about making those ugly faces :)?\n\nYou had an instinct to throw your phone against your bedroom wall with the anger and frustration you were feeling, but quickly came to your senses and stopped yourself from harming your electronics.\n\nYou needed to sleep this fucking day off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time", "result": "Time had passed since your first encounter with G on your computer. Your stomach problems had died down enough that you were able to go back to school two days later, but it still lingered, and you ended up asking G about it.\n\nG said not to worry about it and that it was just apart of the quota, once you were to ascend a spirit, it would die down completely, and would only come back if you neglected your duties to help ascend spirits.\n\nWhen G told you this, you wanted nothing more than to get the first spirit out of the way, but as you pestered G about any possible spirits that you would be able to help, G kept on telling you that you just had to wait until something was to pop up that you could easily complete without binding you to help a high difficulty spirit for good.\n\nIt was around the fourth day while in English class that you had received a message as you felt your phone buzz in your pocket while your teacher was giving you all a lecture. Something about personal growth or some boring shit that you weren't paying all that much attention too.\n\nSneaking your phone out of your pocket and placing it on your lap, you checked your messages only to see that it was from G as you had suspected.\n\nAlright listen dipshit, I got a lead on a spirit that would be a good starting off point for you. There's a few spirts near a bridge where people usually commit suicide, after looking through each one of their backstories and suicide notes depending if there ever was one, I came up with at least two that would be fairly easy to solve. Check your locker during lunch and you'll find a bus pass for the day, it'll take you to the bridge and back home once you're done with everything. Give some excuse to your parents that you're busy or some shit because I'm telling you now, you're not going to be getting home until late tonight. I'll text you once you're out of class with more details.\n\nFuck, it was a Thursday too, couldn't G just waited till tomorrow.\n\nDuring lunch, you opened your locker and stuck between a few notebooks you saw the bus pass that G had mentioned. A shiver ran down your spine as you wondered how G was able to even do this, or if there were other people in on this whole program or whatever it was. All you knew is you didn't want to piss off G all that much if there was this much possibility for direct interference in your life outside of the internet.\n\nLuckily the public bus stop wasn't all that far away from your school, so once classes had ended you went there to wait for the next bus that was to come.\n\nWith your phone in your hands, you waited impatiently for G to text you with more instructions as you started tapping your foot. Soon enough one came as you quickly opened the new message.\n\nG- Here I'm sending you the exact bus routes you'll be taking in order to get to where you need to be, make sure you're not retarded and fall asleep on a bus and miss one of your stops, we need to conserve as much time as possible if we're going to get these quotas done, hell I even think we can do two today depending on how fast you are and how good you are at this job. I'll message you once you get to your location, I can track you through GPS.\n\nJesus fucking Christ, G had set you up to take at least four different buses in order to get to the suicide bridge.\n\nAs you boarded each crowded bus, you sat by yourself in the middle of each one as you just looked out at the scenery with each ride. Time went by at a leisurely pace that matched that of the bus.\n\nThe fourth bus was the emptiest out of all the other ones, with only about seven or eight other people on board. This probably had to do with the fact that you were on the outer edges of town, where only warehouses and other sort of industrial buildings made up the surrounding land.\n\nGetting off at a secluded bus stop all by yourself, you checked your phone for any new messages from G along with finding the time. You see that it's barely four, and you've yet to get any new messages for G which makes you slightly worried. You don't see any bridge in which would be your destination anywhere close, causing you to think that you might have gotten off on the wrong stop.\n\nJust as you think about waiting for another bus, you feel your phone vibrate as you see that you've gotten a message from G.\n\nG- Alright good, so you didn't fuck up with the directions and get yourself lost, it seems I should put more faith in you. Anyway, the bridge that you'll be needing to get to is going to be up the hill to the east of you, by all of those red factories that you should be able to see.\n\nFollowing her directions with your eyes, you see the factories that she's talking about in the distance. It seemed like a far walk though, and you wondered if you could have gotten off closer at another bus stop as you could have sworn you saw one by there as your bus was coming down here. Sighing in laziness, you start your walk as you follow the crumbling sidewalk that goes uphill.\n\nWith a cloudless sky, the sun beat down on you heavily, with the congested smog that made up this part of town not helping you with the walk either, hell you didn't realize that you were this out of shape, as you were already at a loss for breath twenty minutes into the walk. Though as you passed another brick factory, you could finally see the bridge come into view on the other side of the hill. What really fucking sucked though that it was even farther downhill, then what you had walked up in the first place. You let out a pained groan as you continued on with your trek.\n\nIt was probably already close to five-thirty when you finally reached the bridge at the bottom of the hill, and you sat down next to the start of the bridge and took a break to catch your breath. Your back was soaked in sweat and you kept wiping your forehead in a futile effort to get rid of the moisture that was following into your eyes.\n\nYou regretted not bringing water or something on this trip, you reminded yourself to yell at G for not telling you it would be this far of a walk.\n\n\"Hey, are you alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine just a little h-.\" You catch yourself as you answer the question that you guessed was directed to you, you quickly turn your head to face this strange voice and with what comes into view, your heart quickly drops.\n\nAt first, it seemed like countless of them, but as you started to slowly count the spirits, you saw that it was around eight of them all staring directly at you, only a few meters away.\n\nYou were at a loss for words as you quickly picked yourself up and made some space between you and the horde that watched you silently. Fumbling for your phone in your pocket, you started to open your messages to see that G still hadn't sent anything.\n\n\"Hey you fuck, I know you can hear me, fucking send something!\" You quietly yell directly at your phone as the spirits stare at you with puzzlement.\n\nA few seconds after your demand, you see a few speech bubbles as new messages start to appear on your screen.\n\nG- Sorry, Sorry.

However now that you had given each ghost a closer inspection, you notice that most of them didn't really seem all that decayed or worn, at least not as much as others you had encountered.\n\nAs you step closer in preparation to call out to Ken, one of the ghosts says something to the other ghosts in a hushed tone.\n\n\"He can see us...\"\n\n\"Of course he can, he heard what Mike said to him...\" Another one says.\n\n\"What do we do?\"\n\nThe ghosts remain silent as they all go back to looking at you as if waiting for you to do something.

Ken is still standing there like normal. Though he tries walking forward, and much to both of your surprise, he manages to get out of the boundary.\n\n\"I can leave!\" He exclaims with surprise.\n\nHe tries to walk farther with quick haste but ends up being blocked by another boundary, though this time it seems closer to you.\n\n\"I guess you're bound to me for now.\"\n\n\"I thought you said I would be going to heaven?\" Ken says with a little disappointment in his voice.\n\n\"You will don't worry, we just need to do a process and you'll be all set to leave.\" You promise him.\n\nLooking back at your phone you look to see if you were sent any more messages from G.\n\nG- Ask the kid the top three things that he wants to do.

Alright fine, I can get you a plane ticket on Friday night to California and you can get back Sunday night, don't pack anything you don't need to and I'll transfer you some money to have fun and shit there.

She was a few feet away from you, though you could tell she was at the very edge of her boundary.\n\n\"What about us, when are we getting out of here.\"\n\nNow that you had Ken bound to you, you didn't really think what G had said would affect you now that you were already bound to a 'contract' or whatever it was referred too.\n\n\"The rest of you will get your turn in due time, there are others like me out there so they'll get to you all eventually. You just have to be patient and wait, that's all I can really tell you honestly.\" You say to her, in which your words don't really seem to help her mood.\n\nSeeing nothing else for you to do, you start to turn around once again and begin to leave the bridge with Ken.\n\nGetting back to the bus stop that would help you get home was a lot shorter of a way to get to compared to what you had to walk when you first got here, G was totally fucking with you.\n\nNevertheless, when you got home you went straight to your mom with the speech of adulthood and freedom that you would give her in order to be able to go to California. Though deep inside your mind you know that still wouldn't work so you decided the next best thing to do would be to go to plan B.\n\n\"Mom a friend invited me to go to Disneyland with him for the weekend, it would be cool if I go right?\"\n\nYour mom gave you a puzzled look when you said this as if she didn't understand what you said.\n\n\"The same friend you've been hanging out with this whole time you've been staying out late after school?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that friend.\" You reply, with a little hesitation.\n\nYou see a little smile appear on her face.\n\n\"Is he going to drive you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we leave Friday night and we're getting back on Sunday.\"\n\n\"Well if it'll only be for the weekend then yea go ahead. I'd like to meet your friend when you get back though.\"\n\nYou tensed up a little when she said this but then just put on a smile and nodded.\n\n\"Thanks, mom.\" You say before quickly walking away while heading up to your room.\n\nThat was a lot easier then you were expecting it to be. Especially since you would be leaving tomorrow. Nevertheless, you started to get some clothes packed while turning on the T.V in your room for him to watch while you got everything ready.\n\n\nThe next school day went by in a blur. Since Ken was assigned to you as a boundary he went where you went. He kept on talking about Disneyland during class and would also ask questions on what you were learning at the given time. At first, you were a little annoyed by this, but it was something that you got quickly used to. You even caught yourself talking to him while you were with other people, which ended up getting you some weird stares and 'who are you talking' discussions.\n\nWhile you were finishing up your last periods, G had wired everything you would need in order to leave tonight, the only thing you had to do was get a ride to the airport, which you would just to with an Uber.\n\n\"What ride should we go on first when we get there, I heard space mountain was really cool and dark and super scary, It's going to be so much fun.\"\n\nKen was getting far more excited then you were at this point.\n\nYou felt a little bad though, there would probably be some rides in which he would be limited, or not be able to ride on at all. You really hoped it was going to be a slow day there, or at the very least have some empty seats that wouldn't hinder Ken from riding on, you couldn't have him get upset or depressed there, you had to think ahead.\n\nWith classes over and done, you had ordered your Uber to pick the two of you up from school, with the destination being the airport. The price was twenty bucks which wasn't bad, but then again it was coming out of G's pocket. Luckily G had gotten you wristbands and fast passes already so it's not like you had to use the money for much anyway besides the hotel.\n\n\"How long is the trip going to take, is it true we're going on a plane too!?\" Ken says with excitement as the two of you wait at the school parking lot curb.\n\nCome to think of it, Ken did say he wanted to be a pilot and riding a plane was on his list. While he wouldn't be directly driving it or anything, you're pretty sure that would count in terms of his list. You knocked two birds with one stone, you're not going to lie, you felt a little proud of yourself.\n\nThe Uber ride was pretty short, you didn't realize that the airport was so close to your school, you should have noticed something like that. Ken had continued talking to you for the ride, but you had to ignore him for most of the time in fear of not getting the driver to think you were a nutcase or something and kick you out.\n\nWith it being one of the largest airports in the area, the entire plaza or center as filled with people either saying goodbye to their loved ones or racing to get to their flight on time.\n\nYou didn't have any bags to check in as all your clothes and other supplies fit nicely in your bag, so you were able to head straight to the waiting gate and wait for your flight to be called. Placing your bag on an empty seat next to you, Ken sat atop of it as he started to talk once again now that you had stopped walking.\n\n\"Thanks again for taking me on this trip, I had no idea that we would be doing this when I first talked to you on the bridge.\"\n\n\"Yeah don't mention it kid it's all part of the job. Tomorrow is going to be your day so make sure to do everything you want, we can stay up all night, the return flight doesn't leave till late afternoon so we'll be fine.\"\n\n\"Great!\" He smiles, the two of you continue to make small chatter until it's time for your plane to be called. Upon boarding and taking your seat, you wait to see if anyone is to sit next to you while Ken shyly stands in the aisle.

I'm sick of watching Arthur.\" Ken grumbles before stomping back over to the T.V and plopping himself down on the carpet.\n\nOnce you were done and ready, you took Ken with you to go downstairs while you served yourself breakfast in the cafeteria. You felt a little bad eating in front of Ken though while you waited, it seems he took notice to this and just waved his hand.\n\n\"I don't get hungry ever.\" He says reassuringly.\n\nEven so, you raced to finish your food as fast as you could before leaving the Hotel itself and heading to the nearest bus stop that would get you to Disneyland.

Or if you're not up to it we can just go back to riding all the kiddy rides again if that's more your style.\n\n\"NO! That's not it, I just thought we could work our way up is all, that's way to much for me to jump too from the kiddy rides.\"\n\n\"Trust me kid, I thought it was scary too at first but it's honestly pretty fun, now I'm not taking no for an answer so come on.\" You say as you begin walking towards monster that dominates the park.\n\n\"Wait, Wait!\"\n\nYou don't listen to Ken though, as you hear his fast footsteps behind you catching up to your pace.\n\nSurprisingly the line for this ride wasn't all that long, you remember it taking ages to get on this, but you were the second ones to get on after the first group was finished.\n\nWith it being empty, you were able to grab an empty seat next to you for Ken since you went for the middle. He was careful with the bars to not nick him as they dropped over his body, but with that out of the way, the two of you were ready to ride.\n\nLooking over at Ken he looked as if he was right about to shit himself at any moment, seemingly shaking.\n\nYou slightly punch his shoulder as he looks over at you.\n\n\"Hey, I wouldn't make you go on this if I didn't think you would have fun alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah....I trust you...\"\n\nKen takes a few deep breathes as the ride starts to lurch forward with all the preparations ready and set.\n\nYou took the liberty of getting the seats in the far back to mitigate Ken's fear from the look of the drops, which seemed to be working as he only bothered to look down at his feet.\n\nUpon the first major drop, you could start to hear the laughter of everybody else in front of you as you yourself started to laugh to try to cheer Ken up.\n\nHe laughed, but it seemed to be a much more forced and nervous one.\n\nWhen it got to the very top and you look down even you were starting to get second thoughts since you hadn't ridden one of these things in years, but before you knew it your cart lurched forward as kinetic energy took over with your stomach immediately dropping with the cart.\n\nScreams and laughter took over your ears as hands started to go up in glee as you did the same.\n\nYou tried to look over at Ken but the coaster kept on shaking you around that you decided to just keep looking forward to avoid a neck injury.\n\nThe ride didn't last as long as you were expecting it to, but that was probably on the account that you were having a blast on it, and once you had gotten off you already wanted to go on again.\n\nSpotting Ken, you looked at his facial expression to see what he thought of the ride.\n\nEmotionless at first, in some type of daze, though as soon as he made eye contact a grin from ear to ear went to his face.\n\n\"That was frickin awesome, I want to go on it again!\" He yelled whilst jumping up and down.\n\n\"Maybe later, we still got another ride I want to try that's an even bigger drop.\"\n\n\"You don't mean...?\"\n\n\"Yep!\" you simply reply.\n\n\"Let's go!\" This time it's Ken who takes the lead as you chase after him in order for the boundary to not yank him back. You knew he knew what you were referring to as he was heading directly towards the tower.\n\nThe tower of terror.\n\nThe line for this ride was about the same, though it seemed that it went by faster though you had no clue as to why.\n\nThis would be the first time riding this ride as even you were too scared to go on this thing when you were little no matter how much your friends had begged you too.\n\n\nYou were glad at his assessment as the two of you got in line. The group that you were tied to was a rather large family, though because of this they themselves including you were the only ones to ride at that given time. You were kind of lucky since you were riding these rides by yourself, you were an outlier in these large crowds that rode rides together, so there was always an empty seat somewhere since everyone else wanted to ride with their families and friends.\n\nAs the room darkened and the narrator began his speech, you saw Ken swaying his body back and forth a little as he looked all around the room with a smile on his face.\n\nYou on the other hand, had no smile on your face as you were a little bit scared on what was to come, you didn't really enjoy the drops at roller coasters, and this one was probably going to be ten times that.\n\n\"Hey look, we can see the entire pa-.\" Ken was cut off as the elevator you all were sitting in drastically fell floors below you as everybody started screaming, including you. Ken, on the other hand, was laughing his ass off as the elevator kept on going up and down with drastic height differences. You hadn't eaten anything beforehand but a sick feeling was starting to form in your stomach as you just wanted the ride to fucking end.\n\nYou actually ended up closing your eyes, in which Ken seemed to notice.\n\n\"Don't tell me you're scared!\" He continued to laugh with the drops.\n\n\"No, I just feel sick...\" You weakly reply.\n\nWhen the ride finally comes to a stop, the grouped family and Ken get off laughing while you struggle behind trying not to vomit.\n\n\"Yeah kid, I think I need a break from rides for a little bit.\" You say while sitting on a bench.\n\n\"Aw really, did you feel that sick from it?\" He asked with a mix of disappointment and worry.\n\n\"Just give me a couple of minutes kid...\" You say while taking a few deep breathes to get your stomach back in functioning order.\n\n\"Man you were right though, I really did enjoy those scary rides, I think I want to ride all of them now if those two were the worst ones out of all of them. Let's get those done first before anything else today please?\" Ken pleads.\n\n\"As long as you give me a few breaks in between Kid then you can get on anything you want today.\"\n\nKen smiled at this.\n\n\"O.K I understand, I'm going to go check out the nearest line to see how long the wait is O.K? I promise it won't be too much of a scary.\n\nYou groan while getting up to your feet.\n\n\"I have to come with you remember. Anyway, I'm ready to get anyway so let's do this.\"\n\n\"Hooray!\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Later that day", "result": "You didn't realize that you had been on so many rides until you felt the soreness of your body kick in as the sun had already set awhile ago.\n\nKen was racing to get on as many rides as he could before the park was to close for the day, and you sluggishly raced after him as fast as your body could keep up. Though when it finally came time to leave, it seemed as if Ken was satisfied as he wasn't begging to stay longer.\n\nOn board the bus back to the hotel, Ken kept on talking about the events that had happened throughout this long day.\n\n\"Man Space Mountain was probably one of the best rides there, I'm glad we managed to make getting on it before the park closed,\" Ken states with satisfaction.\n\n\"Yeah it was a pretty fun day, even though we did a lot and it felt like we rode everything, it still felt really short.\" You remark as the bus takes you through the night back to your hotel.\n\nKen nods in agreement. \"Still though, it's not like I'm leaving regretting anything, I did everything I wanted too...\". Ken's voice seemed to drop heavily as all the enthusiasm that he had seconds before almost instantly vanished.\n\n\"Well that's good, this entire trip was for you to have a good time, I had one too. I honestly wish I could do this every weekend.\" You say with a little laugh, though Ken doesn't respond, and the rest of the ride is filled with an awkward smile.\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel and getting off the bus, Ken is slow, dragging his feet while you keep looking behind you to make sure you didn't lose him every two or three minutes.\n\n\"Everything O.K man?\" You asked worryingly since this was really out of place behavior compared to what happened today. Still, there was the silence, though Ken increased the speed at which he was walking this time.\n\nHe didn't even bother opening the hotel room door, he just walked straight through it. You've never seen the kid be able to do that and now you were actually starting to worry, hastily opening the door with your key-card, you push it open and look for Ken in the main room, in which he is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Ken!\" You shout heavily, starting to look everywhere around the hotel room to see where he could be.\n\nYou finally end up finding him as you see his legs sticking out from under his own bed.\n\n\"Ken what the hell are you doing, you scared me. Get out from under there.\" You order with a sigh of relief.\n\nSeeing that his hiding spot had been compromised, Ken starts to squirm his way out while sitting himself down as he finished doing so, facing away from you.\n\n\"Ken you have to tell me what's wrong, you're really starting to worry me. Did something happen on the bus?\" You ask, remembering that his change of mood started there.\n\nHe weakly shakes his head as he continues to not look at you, which makes you a little frustrated.\n\nYou try to grab his shoulders in order to turn him around so that he can face you. Though your arms go straight through his body as the only thing you grasp is air.\n\nSeeing that, that wouldn't work you walk around him and kneel down so that you can get a look at his face.\n\nYou kind of cringe a little on the inside when you see all the tears and snot that had built up all over his face, making it one big twisted mess while his red puffy eyes didn't want to make direct eye contact with you.\n\n\"Ken you got to tell what's wrong...\" You ask again, although this time with a much softer voice.\n\nKen begins to wipe away the tears and snot from his face, but more keep flowing so it only makes them spread more.\n\n\"I tho-thought I was h-happy. But after remembering everything, that I I-I'm going to leave soon. I just g-got scared...\" Ken cries with numerous hiccups in between his words.\n\n\"I don't want to leave, I had so much fun with you today and now I'm going to forget it all! I know you're going to make me leave as soon as we get home, but I'm not ready to leave...I'm scared.....I want to stay here and keep on having fun with you!\" His tears were really falling now, you tried to grab his arm to console him but once again your hands went through his body. This probably had something to do with his emotions.\n\nYou didn't really know what to say to him either. He was going to ascend as soon as G gave the word for him to do so. It's not like you didn't want him to stay either, you were having lot's of fun and you wish he could experience more with how young he was when he passed. Though you saw no way around this, he was going to move on whether you liked it or not, the only thing to do now was to try to give a positive outlook on the whole situation.\n\nSitting down next to Ken you begin to speak.\n\n\"Listen, kid. I had a lot of fun with you today, more than I probably had in a long ass time. I don't remember the last time I even went out before this to be honest. Look I know you're scared, I would be too in your situation. What I'm trying to say though is that you should enjoy the memories that you've gotten to experience so far, the fun that you've had up to this point, there's no use in dwelling on the past or on things you can't change. I wasn't a very religious person before all of this, but if I was chosen to help you ascend up into the sky above, then that has to mean you have something to look forward too, something is waiting for you, and who knows maybe it's a lot better than this life.\" you say, trying to help him feel even a little bit better.\n\nKen sniffled a little bit more as he wiped his nose with his palm. You didn\u2019t know ghosts could cry like this, how it was even possible, but now wasn\u2019t the time to question things like this.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s so unfair, I don\u2019t know why my dad had to take that bridge, if he hadn\u2019t none of this would have happened\u2026\u201d\n\nYou let Ken vent a little more as you just sat there in silence since there were some things that you weren\u2019t able to refute or deny. The more he vented, however, the calmer he seemed to become, along with acquiring a more lax attitude.\n\n\u201cIs there any way you can visit me...?\u201d Ken asked you, which made your whole body freeze a little.\n\nTaking a moment before responding, you chose your words carefully.\n\n\"I mean I'll probably see you again eventually when it's my turn to ascend in the future. Though I'm sure there's some way for me to try to contact you, and if there is then I promise you that'll I'll find it.\"\n\n\"You really promise me that?\" Ken asks, with a heavy voice.\n\n\"You bet I do.\"\n\nKen keeps a bit of eye contact with you, before looking back at his knees while he hugs them.\n\nThe two of you sit there in silence until you feel a buzzing from your pocket. Getting out your phone, you see that G had sent you a few messages.\n\nG- Alright so here's the deal, you're going to have to do the ascension there at the hotel room, I was planning on you doing it here, but I don't want to risk anything so get ready to start the preparations.\n\nYou feel your heart start to rapidly beat as you type in a reply.\n\n\"What the fuck do you mean I have to do it right now? That's way too soon!\"\n\nG- Listen to me, if you don't do it now then there might be some complications getting him up. I didn't just spend all that fucking money for you to have a happy make a wish foundation day for this kid just so that he can't fucking ascend, follow the instructions I'm about to send you and get it the fuck done.\n\nG then sends you a list of instructions, much similar to the ones that he had given you when you first bonded with Ken.\n\nKen seems to see your frustration. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\nYou bite your tongue as the words you want to tell him won't leave your mouth.\n\n\"There's.....there's been a slight change in plans.\"\n\nAnother instruction in the list that G had given you said that Ken couldn't be sad while doing this ritual, which would be fucking hard to pull off seeing as what just happen.\n\n\"Ken, I'm going to help you ascend right now, it's time to do it.\" You say, coming off as blunt as possible.\n\nKen's eye furrowed in a type of fear and panic, as he quickly got up from sitting down, in which you joined him.\n\n\"Now listen, it's not anything bad it's ju-.\"\n\n\"Why does it have to be right now! Why can't we just wait a little longer!\" Ken cries as he cuts you off.\n\n\"I'm sorry but your time has been designated for this moment.

At first, he only said single word answers, though as the questions continued he started to get more in depth with what he said until he was bringing up every small detail of whatever he was reminiscing about.\n\n\"When they first took my body after the car crash, I couldn't stop freaking out. I tried to get the attention of the rescuers, but nobody saw me, and I cried for so long on top of that bridge. It came to the point in where I couldn't stand to be up there, so I decided to go under the bridge where I thought it would be quiet. Turns out a lot of people died there, so I was never really lonely, but that's when I really found out that I was dead, and there was nothing I could do about it...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you sooner Ken, really I wish that there was more of my kind that could help you guys, the amount of time some people have to wait to be helped is ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Please make sure everyone at that bridge get's out of there like me, one of the men there said that he had been there for over a year, I was probably the one with the least amount of time spent there, I don't even know why you picked me first.\"\n\nYou didn't have the heart to tell this kid the only reason G picked him is that he thought making him happy would be easy. If that was how these people filtered out which ghosts were worth saving, then who knows how long some of the spirits would have to wait before being saved.\n\nThis whole system was shit, but that wasn't something to be worrying about right now, you would talk about it with G when the time was right.\n\n\"I promise I'll get everyone out of that bridge kid.\"\n\nHe nods, and stays silent for a moment as if trying to find something else to say.\n\n\"I think I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? If you need a little more time, I'm not even tired.\" You say, although lying a little bit.\n\nKen shakes his head though. \"If I think about it anymore it's only going to get worse in my head, this is as ready as I'll be I think.\"\n\nWith that Ken stands up, and you do as well.\n\nThe two of you look at each other for a bit, and a bitter small smile appears on Ken's face as he outstretches his hand.\n\n\"Thank you for the fun day today, and for getting me on a plane, you really did a lot for what time you had with me.\"\n\n\"Well thanks for being such a good kid about everything, hanging out with you was like hanging out with someone my own age, you're a really smart kid. Wherever you're going to end up, I know you'll come out on top.\"\n\nKen laughs a little, and so do you. At this point, your eyes start to sting, but you keep your head held high as you outstretch your hand in which both of you have your palms clasped with one another, just like at the start.\n\n\"Don't forget my face when I find you again.\" You say, knowing in your heart it was about to happen.\n\n\"Never.\" His kiddish eyes glowed, and they glowed.

There was actually something you were looking to experiment with to see if it worked or not.\n\nSitting down on a bench, you take off the covering for the cotton candy and point it at Ken's face who's taken aback a bit in surprise.\n\n\"I can't eat that...\" He says.\n\n\"Don't eat it, lick it.\" You reply.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Try it, trust me.\" You say.\n\nA bit hesitant, Ken does as you say and licks a bit of the cotton candy.\n\nHis eyes light up instantly as he begins to lick it more, with much more vigor.\n\n\"I know you ghosts can't eat stuff, but I thought that you guys would still be able to taste since you can touch things and all.\" You explain while Ken indulges in pleasure.\n\n\"I never thought I could do this since I was never able to grab anything before!

Ignoring the weird looks some people gave, Ken asked you a question as soon as you were out of earshot from everyone else.\n\n\"Are you sure this ride is safe, shouldn't it have seatbelts?\" He asks worryingly.\n\n\"Don't worry, people ride this thing every day. If you're really worried though just hang on to me when we reach the top.\" You assure him in which he just nods.\n\nAs you begin to ascend the mountain, you and Ken both laugh at the animatronics that sing and talk throughout the ride.

I want to go on it again!\" He says with glee.\n\nYou also shared his sentiment, but with how long the line was, you decided that it was best to just go on it later tonight when you had the free time.\n\n\"Let's go to the picture kiosk, I want to see if I made a funny face.\" You say to Ken.\n\nYou were the last one in line in the Kiosk, and since it was so crowded, you couldn't really see your own picture until it was your turn up in front. When the lady manning the kiosk looked at you, a bigger smile than she had before appeared on her face.\n\n\"You and your little brother are probably one of the better pictures I've seen so fa today, his smile was so cute when he was hanging on behind you.\" She says with a laugh.\n\nAt first, you think she had mistaken you with someone else, but as she points at the picture and you look at it, your heart drops almost instantly.\n\nKen was indeed in the picture behind you, though his whole figure was a little bit hazed as if he wasn't all completely there.\n\n\"Sorry about how he looks, the cameras can be a bit iffy with the water and all, I have to remember to tell my manager to get it checked out.\" She remarks.\n\n\"N-No it's fine!

It's just I didn't think you would actually show up on the picture.

You've never seen the kid be able to do that and now you were actually starting to worry, hastily opening the door with your key-card, you push it open and look for Ken in the main room, in which he is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Ken!\" You shout heavily, starting to look everywhere around the hotel room to see where he could be.\n\nYou finally end up finding him as you see his legs sticking out from under his own bed.\n\n\"Ken what the hell are you doing, you scared me. Get out from under there.\" You order with a sigh of relief.\n\nSeeing that his hiding spot had been compromised, Ken starts to squirm his way out while sitting himself down as he finished doing so, facing away from you.\n\n\"Ken you have to tell me what's wrong, you're really starting to worry me. Did something happen on the bus?\" You ask, remembering that his change of mood started there.\n\nHe weakly shakes his head as he continues to not look at you, which makes you a little frustrated.\n\nYou try to grab his shoulders in order to turn him around so that he can face you. Though your arms go straight through his body as the only thing you grasp is air.\n\nSeeing that, that wouldn't work you walk around him and kneel down so that you can get a look at his face.\n\nYou kind of cringe a little on the inside when you see all the tears and snot that had built up all over his face, making it one big twisted mess while his red puffy eyes didn't want to make direct eye contact with you.\n\n\"Ken you got to tell what's wrong...\" You ask again, although this time with a much softer voice.\n\nKen begins to wipe away the tears and snot from his face, but more keep flowing so it only makes them spread more.\n\n\"I tho-thought I was h-happy. But after remembering everything, that I I-I'm going to leave soon. I just g-got scared...\" Ken cries with numerous hiccups in between his words.\n\n\"I don't want to leave, I had so much fun with you today and now I'm going to forget it all! I know you're going to make me leave as soon as we get home, but I'm not ready to leave...I'm scared.....I want to stay here and keep on having fun with you!\" His tears were really falling now, you tried to grab his arm to console him but once again your hands went through his body. This probably had something to do with his emotions.\n\nYou didn't really know what to say to him either. He was going to ascend as soon as G gave the word for him to do so. It's not like you didn't want him to stay either, you were having lot's of fun and you wish he could experience more with how young he was when he passed. Though you saw no way around this, he was going to move on whether you liked it or not, the only thing to do now was to try to give a positive outlook on the whole situation.\n\nSitting down next to Ken you begin to speak.\n\n\"Listen, kid. I had a lot of fun with you today, more than I probably had in a long ass time. I don't remember the last time I even went out before this, to be honest. Look I know you're scared, I would be too in your situation. What I'm trying to say though is that you should enjoy the memories that you've gotten to experience so far, the fun that you've had up to this point, there's no use in dwelling on the past or on things you can't change. I wasn't a very religious person before all of this, but if I was chosen to help you ascend up into the sky above, then that has to mean you have something to look forward too, something is waiting for you, and who knows maybe it's a lot better than this life.\" you say, trying to help him feel even a little bit better.\n\nKen sniffled a little bit more as he wiped his nose with his palm. You didn\u2019t know ghosts could cry like this, how it was even possible, but now wasn\u2019t the time to question things like this.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s so unfair, I don\u2019t know why my dad had to take that bridge, if he hadn\u2019t none of this would have happened\u2026\u201d\n\nYou let Ken vent a little more as you just sat there in silence since there were some things that you weren\u2019t able to refute or deny. The more he vented, however, the calmer he seemed to become, along with acquiring a more lax attitude.\n\n\u201cIs there any way you can visit me...?\u201d Ken asked you, which made your whole body freeze a little.\n\nTaking a moment before responding, you chose your words carefully.\n\n\"I mean I'll probably see you again eventually when it's my turn to ascend in the future. Though I'm sure there's some way for me to try to contact you, and if there is then I promise you that'll I'll find it.\"\n\n\"You really promise me that?\" Ken asks, with a heavy voice.\n\n\"You bet I do.\"\n\nKen keeps a bit of eye contact with you, before looking back at his knees while he hugs them.\n\nThe two of you sit there in silence until you feel a buzzing from your pocket. Getting out your phone, you see that G had sent you a few messages.\n\nG- Alright so here's the deal, you're going to have to do the ascension there at the hotel room, I was planning on you doing it here, but I don't want to risk anything so get ready to start the preparations.\n\nYou feel your heart start to rapidly beat as you type in a reply.\n\n\"What the fuck do you mean I have to do it right now? That's way too soon!\"\n\nG- Listen to me, if you don't do it now then there might be some complications getting him up. I didn't just spend all that fucking money for you to have a happy make a wish foundation day for this kid just so that he can't fucking ascend, follow the instructions I'm about to send you and get it the fuck done.\n\nG then sends you a list of instructions, much similar to the ones that he had given you when you first bonded with Ken.\n\nKen seems to see your frustration. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\nYou bite your tongue as the words you want to tell him won't leave your mouth.\n\n\"There's.....there's been a slight change in plans.\"\n\nAnother instruction in the list that G had given you said that Ken couldn't be sad while doing this ritual, which would be fucking hard to pull off seeing as what just happen.\n\n\"Ken, I'm going to help you ascend right now, it's time to do it.\" You say, coming off as blunt as possible.\n\nKen's eye furrowed in a type of fear and panic, as he quickly got up from sitting down, in which you joined him.\n\n\"Now listen, it's not anything bad it's ju-.\"\n\n\"Why does it have to be right now! Why can't we just wait a little longer!\" Ken cries as he cuts you off.\n\n\"I'm sorry but your time has been designated for this moment. Ken, please remember what I said earlier, just take a moment to console yourself and I'll help you through this, but we have to get it done today, I'm sorry.\" you apologize again, though Ken himself seems to be getting himself under control as he sits down on his bed.\n\nYou look his face and see that he's trying to get a straight expression on it, but his mouth and eyes keep on twitching, and before you know it, he starts weeping once again, although this time it's more of a soft one, one you couldn't bear to look at.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}, {"action": "Medium level thrill rides", "result": "Ken was probably a little too young for the extreme roller coasters that they had here, with him also being a ghost, there was a chance of an accident happening that you wouldn't be able to intervene in.\n\nThe medium rides wouldn't bore him but wouldn't be too dangerous either.\n\n\"Alright then, let's start with space mountain since the drops on that aren't really too bad,\" you say giving Ken your decision.\n\n\"Yes! I knew you would pick that one! Come on I think I know the way I saw it on one of the billboard maps!\" Ken says as he starts running.\n\n\"Hey wait!\" Ignoring the looks of other park guests you start to run after Ken.\n\nRunning throughout the park while taking breaks to look at the maps posted around, you finally reach the section containing space mountain as the two of you get into massive designated line.\n\nThere were a pretty decent amount of people waiting, but it wasn't the size that you were expecting which was good.\n\nWhen it was finally your turn to take your seat, you picked the spot all the way in the back hoping that nobody else would ride with you, with Ken already taking up the seat next to you.\n\nBy your lucks, you were able to save the empty seat as the man gave the thumbs up for the ride to start.\n\n\"Are you sure there aren't any big drops or anything?\" Ken says with genuine worry.\n\n\"Yeah don't worry about it, it's just a really fun ride that swoops you around in the dark.\"\n\nKen slowly nods as the lights begin to dim while the track starts to pull you with speed.\n\n\n\"Oh my god that was awesome, I felt myself laughing the whole entire time! That as probably one of the best roller-coasters I've ever ridden!\" Ken exclaims with adoration for what he had just experienced.\n\n\"Yeah it was pretty fun reliving that memory.\" You agree while keeping a steady pace along with the eager kid.\n\nOn your walk to no actual destination, you stop by a cotton candy vendor and buy a stick. There was actually something you were looking to experiment with to see if it worked or not.\n\nSitting down on a bench, you take off the covering for the cotton candy and point it at Ken's face who's taken aback a bit in surprise.\n\n\"I can't eat that...\" He says.\n\n\"Don't eat it, lick it.\" You reply.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Try it, trust me.\" You say.\n\nA bit hesitant, Ken does as you say and licks a bit of the cotton candy.\n\nHis eyes light up instantly as he begins to lick it more, with much more vigor.\n\n\"I know you ghosts can't eat stuff, but I thought that you guys would still be able to taste since you can touch things and all.\" You explain while Ken indulges in pleasure.\n\n\"I never thought I could do this since I was never able to grab anything before! This is great!\"\n\nTouching the cotton candy with your hand, you felt no wetness from where Ken had touched. Still, though you were a little grossed out with eating the parts that he had licked, so you had torn off the bottom section for yourself to eat alone.\n\nAfter finishing your snacks and taking a quick trip to the bathroom, you went on the find the next ride that you could do together, though you already had two in mind.\n\n\"Alright, kid do you want to do splash mountain or the rapid one where they put you in that circular tube kinda thingy.\" You say, letting him decide.\n\n\"Splash mountain yes! Everyone at school always wanted to go on that and the ones who had said the feeling of your stomach dropping was so fun! I want to sit in the back though.\"\n\n\"How come?\" You ask.\n\n\"Reasons, besides wouldn't it look weird if I sat in the front and no one could see me?\"\n\n\"Yeah that would be pretty weird, O.K, let's go get in line before it gets too big.\"\n\nThe line to Splash Mountain was unsurprisingly the biggest one you had encountered at the park, mostly for it being the ride that almost everybody could go on, and everyone wanted to go on.\n\nWhile in line, Ken kept on racing back and forth from the front to where you were waiting to see how long it would be until it was your turn to ride, you were a bit worried he would push people which would lead to questions and hysteria, but he was careful to glide through the crowds with ease.\n\nLuckily, the line was going in a zigzag formation so it didn't mess with the boundary either luckily, even then though, your boundary felt bigger than it did last time for some reason.\n\nWhen it finally came to be your own turn to get on after about ten minutes of waiting, you were able to get a log to yourself since you were the only single rider who wanted to get on in your section. Ignoring the weird looks some people gave, Ken asked you a question as soon as you were out of earshot from everyone else.\n\n\"Are you sure this ride is safe, shouldn't it have seatbelts?\" He asks worryingly.\n\n\"Don't worry, people ride this thing every day. If you're really worried though just hang on to me when we reach the top.\" You assure him in which he just nods.\n\nAs you begin to ascend the mountain, you and Ken both laugh at the animatronics that sing and talk throughout the ride. Though upon reaching the top, you feel Ken squirm behind you as if he's nervous.\n\nEven you feel a little queasy as you see the park before you atop of the drop.\n\n\"Actually you may want to han-.\"\n\nYou are interrupted as the log tips over the edge while you both let out a scream and Ken latches onto your back with his arms.\n\nThe log causes a tremendous splash at the bottom as both of your bodies jerk forward from the momentum. A bit of your pants is soaked as you exit the ride.\n\nThe same laughter that Ken had at Space Mountain is mirrored here as his head bobs up and down in enthusiasm.\n\n\"That was freaking awesome! I want to go on it again!\" He says with glee.\n\nYou also shared his sentiment, but with how long the line was, you decided that it was best to just go on it later tonight when you had the free time.\n\n\"Let's go to the picture kiosk, I want to see if I made a funny face.\" You say to Ken.\n\nYou were the last one in line in the Kiosk, and since it was so crowded, you couldn't really see your own picture until it was your turn up in front. When the lady manning the kiosk looked at you, a bigger smile than she had before appeared on her face.\n\n\"You and your little brother are probably one of the better pictures I've seen so fa today, his smile was so cute when he was hanging on behind you.\" She says with a laugh.\n\nAt first you think she had mistaken you with someone else, but as she points at the picture and you look at it, your heart drops almost instantly.\n\nKen was indeed in the picture behind you, though his whole figure was a little bit hazed as if he wasn't all completely there.\n\n\"Sorry about how he looks, the cameras can be a bit iffy with the water and all, I have to remember to tell my manager to get it checked out.\" She remarks.\n\n\"N-No it's fine! Say how much is that picture?\" You quickly stammer while taking out your wallet.\n\n\n\nI didn't do anything wrong did I....\" Ken meekly says while the two of you sit on a bench as you look at the picture before you.\n\n\"No, not at all! It's just I didn't think you would actually show up on the picture. Though honestly I think it made it all the much better, the lady was right you did have a pretty dumb face while going down.\" You laugh trying to change the mood.\n\n\"Not as dumb as yours, look how scared you look!\" Ken replies with a smile while pointing at your face.\n\nPutting the picture away, you get up from the bench and give your arms a stretch.\n\n\"Well we still got a lot of time to kill today with all these rides, we got to get as many done as we can before we leave.\" You say while pulling out your pamphlet map.\n\n\"Yeah, I want to ride this one next! Someone at school told me that it was pretty fun and the lines aren't that long either!.\" Ken says with eagerness as he points to one of the attractions on the map.\n\n\"Well let's get to it then.\" You say, putting the map back into your pocket.\n\nOff the two of you were, enjoying the rest of your day with the park that was before you.", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Adult mega thrill rides", "result": "You remember being totally scared of all the big roller coasters when you first came to this park when you were younger, but after riding them once they weren't all that bad, so maybe it would be the same for Ken. Besides you were looking for a thrill too.\n\n\"Alright Ken, were going to try out that biggest rides here, starting with that one.\"\nYou say pointing at a towering roller-coaster with a giant drop that you could see from the entrance, which was the California Screamin.\n\nThe joy that Ken had earlier seemed to vanish, as he took one look at the ride and looked back at you with honest fear in his eyes.\n\n\"Why that one?\"\n\n\"Didn't you want to ride all the rides?\"\n\n\"I never said that.\" He states.\n\n\"Oh, Well we might as well since we're here. Or if you're not up to it we can just ride all the kiddy rides if that's more your style.\n\n\"NO! That's not it, I just thought we could work our way up is all, that's way to much for me to start with.\"\n\n\"Trust me kid, I thought it was scary too at first but it's honestly pretty fun, now I'm not taking no for an answer so come on.\" You say as you begin walking towards monster that dominates the park.\n\n\"Wait, Wait!\"\n\nYou don't listen to Ken though, as you hear his fast footsteps behind you catching up to your pace.\n\nSurprisingly the line for this ride wasn't all that long, you remember it taking ages to get on this, but you were the second ones to get on after the first group was finished.\n\nWith it being empty, you were able to grab an empty seat next to you for Ken since you went for the middle. He was careful for the bars to not to nick him as they dropped over his body, but with that out of the way, the two of you were ready to ride.\n\nLooking over at Ken he looked as if he was right about to shit himself at any moment, seemingly shaking.\n\nYou slightly punch his shoulder as he looks over at you.\n\n\"Hey, I wouldn't make you go on this if I didn't think you would have fun alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah....I trust you...\"\n\nKen takes a few deep breathes as the ride starts to lurch forward with all the preparations ready and set.\n\nYou took the liberty of getting the seats in the far back to mitigate Ken's fear from the look of the drops, which seemed to be working as he only bothered to look down at his feet.\n\nUpon the first major drop, you could start to hear the laughter of everybody else in front of you as you yourself started to laugh to try to cheer Ken up.\n\nHe laughed, but his seemed to be a much more forced and nervous one.\n\nWhen it got to the very top and you look down even you were starting to get second thoughts since you hadn't ridden one of these things in years, but before you knew it your cart lurched forward as kinetic energy took over with your stomach immediately dropping with the cart.\n\nScreams and laughter took over your ears as hands started to go up in glee as you did the same.\n\nYou tried to look over at Ken but the coaster kept on shaking you around that you decided to just keep looking forward to avoid a neck injury.\n\nThe ride didn't last as long as you were expecting it to, but that was probably on the account that you were having a blast on it, and once you had gotten off you already wanted to go on again.\n\nSpotting Ken, you looked at his facial expression to see what he thought of the ride.\n\nEmotionless at first, in some type of daze, though as soon as he made eye contact a grin from ear to ear went to his face.\n\n\"That was frickin awesome, I want to go on it again!\" He yelled whilst jumping up and down.\n\n\"Maybe later, we still got another ride I want to try that's an even bigger drop.\"\n\n\"You don't mean...?\"\n\n\"Yep!\" you simply reply.\n\n\"Let's go!\" This time it's Ken who takes the lead as you chase after him in order for the boundary to not yank him back. You knew he knew what you were referring to as he was heading directly towards the tower.\n\nThe tower of terror.\n\nThe line for this ride was about the same, though it seemed that it went by faster though you had no clue as to why.\n\nThis would be the first time riding this ride as even you were too scared to go on this thing when you were little no matter how much your friends had begged you too.\n\nThe scared look that Ken had when he was in line for last ride was mirrored on his face at this moment. Though this time there seemed to be a bit of determination in his eye as he looked at you.\n\n\"This ride isn't going to be scary, it's going to be fun!\"\n\nYou were glad at his assessment as the two of you got in line. The group that you were tied to was a rather large family, though because of this they themselves including you were the only ones to ride at that given time. You were kind of lucky since you were riding these rides by yourself, you were an outlier in these large crowds that rode rides together, so there was always an empty seat somewhere since everyone else wanted to ride with their families and friends.\n\nAs the room darkened and the narrator began his speech, you saw Ken swaying his body back and forth a little as he looked all around the room with a smile on his face.\n\nYou, on the other hand, had no smile on your face as you were a little bit scared on what was to come, you didn't really enjoy the drops at roller coasters, and this one was probably going to be ten times that.\n\n\"Hey look, we can see the entire pa-.\" Ken was cut off as the elevator you all were sitting in drastically fell floors below you as everybody started screaming, including you.

You hadn't eaten anything before hand but a sick feeling was starting to form in your stomach as you just wanted the ride to fucking end.\n\nYou actually ended up closing your eyes, in which Ken seemed to notice.\n\n\"Don't tell me you're scared!\" He continued to laugh with the drops.\n\n\"No, I just feel sick...\" You weakly reply.\n\nWhen the ride finally comes to a stop, the grouped family and Ken get off laughing while you straggle behind trying not to vomit.\n\n\"Yeah kid, I think I need a break from rides for a little bit.\" You say while sitting on a bench.\n\n\"Aw really, did you feel that sick from it?\" He asked with a mix of disappointment and worry.\n\n\"Just give me a couple of minutes kid...\". You say while taking a few deep breathes to get your stomach back in functioning order.\n\n\"Man you were right though, I really did enjoy those scary rides, I think I want to ride all of them now if those two were the worst ones out of all of them. Let's get those done first before anything else today please?\" Ken pleads.\n\n\"As long as you give me a few breaks in between Kid then you can get on anything you want today.\"\n\nKen smiled at this.\n\n\"O.K I understand, I'm going to go check out the nearest line to see how long the wait is O.K?

Alright, I should be able to hook you up this weekend at the soonest so be ready. I don't know what type of plane exactly my friend owns, but I think he should be able to let the kid fly a little, or at least touch a button or two to make it look like he's doing some helpful shit.

We'll even be able to do it by this weekend.\"\n\nKen seemed to beam at this news as you could sense his giddiness.\n\n\"Really! What type of plane is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it'll probably be a small one though. The pilot from what I heard can also see ghosts, so you'll be able to help him fly a bit depending on how things go.\"\n\nKen's smile grew even bigger as he started to jump a little.\n\n\"Alright let's get home, this walk has gotten me fucking exhausted.\" You say as you begin to turn around from the bridge.'\n\n\"Hey wait!\" You hear someone say to you.\n\nTurning around you see the same ghost that Ken was hiding behind earlier. She was a few feet away from you, though you could tell she was at the very edge of her boundary.\n\n\"What about us, when are we getting out of here.\"\n\nNow that you had Ken bound to you, you didn't really think what G had said would affect you now that you were already bound to a 'contract' or whatever it was referred too.\n\n\"The rest of you will get your turn in due time, there are others like me out there so they'll get to you all eventually. You just have to be patient and wait, that's all I can really tell you honestly.\" You say to her, in which your words don't really seem to help her mood.\n\nSeeing nothing else for you to do, you start to turn around once again and begin to leave the bridge with Ken.\n\nGetting back to the bus stop that would help you get home was a lot shorter of a way to get to compared to what you had to walk when you first got here, G was totally fucking with you.\n\nUpon getting home you say Hi to your mom and tell her the reason for which you were out so late before heading to your room.\n\n\"Do ghosts sleep?\" You ask Ken before getting ready to head to bed.\n\n\"No, at least I don't. I haven't seen anyone else sleep either at the bridge...\" He replies with a thoughtful answer.\n\n\"Alright, then I'll turn on the T.V for you, just keep it down to a quiet volume and wake me up in the morning at five. Just don't leave this room, got it?\"\n\nKen nods at your command.\n\nAs you begin to reach for the remote, Ken gets to it first as he hits on the ON switch, which to your surprise turns the T.V on.\n\n\"You can touch things like that?\"\n\nKen seems confused by your obvious statement, but then he also seems surprised himself as he soon as he realizes what you meant.\n\nNot only that, Ken was able to touch you directly at the Bridge when you did the ritual for him to be bound to you.\n\nYou start to wonder why you didn't see this sooner, though you just end up going along with it.\n\n\"Well anyways good night, and remember to wake me up.\"\n\nWith that being said, you sprawled your body out onto your mattress, managing to doze off in seconds.\n\n\"Hey wake up.\"\n\nYou feel someone shaking you side to side as your eyes slowly open from deep slumber. You look to see Ken who's still shaking you until you push away his hand and make him stop.\n\n\"What time is it.\" You yawn.\n\n\"Fourth-thirty, I thought you would probably want to wake up earlier and I was getting really bored so...\"\n\nWell, no wonder you were so fucking tired. Well, there was no chance you were getting back to sleep now anyway. Without another word, you grab your clothes and other essentials before heading into the bathroom.\n\n\"We're leaving in an hour.\" You say to Ken before closing the door.\n\n---\n\nClasses today went by pretty slowly. Since Ken was assigned to you as a boundary he went where you went. He kept on talking about riding in the plane during class and would also ask questions on what you were learning at the given time during each period. At first, you were a little annoyed by this, but it was something that you got quickly used to. You even caught yourself talking to him while you were with other people, which ended up getting you some weird stares and 'who are you talking' discussions.\n\nWhile you were finishing up your last periods, G messaged you some of the details on what would happen for the plane ride. It would be today later in the day at a nearby small private airfield, and the pilot would try to let Ken touch some buttons and stuff to make him happy. You weren't all that excited as Ken was, but a private plane ride still was pretty cool, so you would be lying if you said you weren't slightly looking forward to it.\n\n\"You really think the pilot is going to let me fly? Man, I'm so nervous I don't want to mess anything up. You'll be there too right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course, I mean your bound to me remember?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, you're right.\" Ken laughs, which makes you laugh too.\n\nThough upon seeing some people stare at you in the hallways, your face turns a deep shade of red as you quickly start to walk away with Ken at your heels.\n\nG said that someone was picking you that was a friend of the pilot. So and Ken waited in the parking lot as students slowly started to trickle out of campus until there was only a handful of people left.\n\n\"Is he running late?\" Ken asks with a bit of worry in his voice.\n\n\"I mean the airfield must be pretty far way, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.\"\n\nThese words seemed to make Ken tenser as his frown grew deeper.\n\n\"Don't worry to much about it, I guarantee you were going to fly today.\"\n\nYou honestly weren't that sure that you would be flying today but your words seem to get some enthusiasm back into Ken so you were glad.\n\nYour ride did eventually get here about a half hour later, as a vehicle pulled up into the parking lot that matched the description that G had given you. To which Ken started jumping up and down with excitement.\n\nWith the driver rolling down his window you and Ken looked inside.\n\n\"Are you our ride to the airport?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yeah, do the two of you want to get in the back?\"\n\n\"Yeah tha-.\" You pause reflexively as your brain stops for a brief moment.\n\n\"Wait....Can...Can you se-.\"\n\n\"Get in, I'll explain it on the way.\" The man smiles as he points to the back.\n\nDoing as you were told you and Ken got in while waiting for the explanation that the man was about to give you, but you asked a question first.\n\n\"I thought G said only the pilot could see ghosts, you aren't the pilot are you?\" You ask hesitantly.\n\n\"No I'm not the pilot, I'm his spotter.\" The driver answers as he starts to pull out of the parking lot.\n\n\"Spotter?\" You ask confused.\n\n\"Yeah, me and the pilot are assigned together to spot ghosts from the skies. To just get it through briefly, we fly planes over wooded areas and canyons in which hikers or other types of people may have died accidentally or just had their bodies dumped. Normally if one of them turns into a spirit they would have little to no chance to be found by any of you guys, so it's our job to go and look for whoever we can and help them ascend.\" The man explains.\n\n\"That's cool, but do you guys do it forever? Does anyone help you?\" You ask.\n\n\"No were the only ones in our region I think. Our quotas are a little difficult to fulfill with all the dead that need saving, but with it comes some perks that I'd rather not disclose to you, you'd get very jealous.\" The man laughs heartily as he takes a turn that leads onto the freeway.\n\nThe three of you continue to make conversation throughout the car ride that lasts for quite a while. From the city, you end up driving for quite a while until there's nothing but desert all around you. Not to say that the car ride was boring though, it was probably one of the most interesting ones you ever been on. Discussing ghosts, the driver's line of work, whose name turned out to be Dom and the pilot Micheal, kept the whole ride entertaining.\n\nBy the time you arrived at the Airfield, it was almost five. Though while you were getting to the airport Dom had told the two of you that Micheal was getting the plane ready to fly as soon as you arrived.\n\nThough it wasn't a plane that was out on the runway, it was a helicopter.\n\nDom had driven up right to where it was landed, with a man standing next to it, who you assumed was Micheal.\n\nUpon exiting the car, Ken immediately ran over to the helicopter as he started to examine every part of it, circling it constantly.\n\n\"Sorry I couldn't get the plane out, but I don't think we all could have fit, it's very cramped in there. This is the next best thing that we can use though. I hope you're not disappointed.\" Micheal said towards Ken with a smile.\n\nKen didn't take his eyes off the helicopter though as he was touching every part of it.\n\n\"No way, I actually think this is way cooler!\"\n\n\"Well, that's good to hear because you're going to help fly it in the front seat.\"\n\nKen takes his eyes away from the helicopter for the first time and looks at Micheal directly into his eyes.\n\n\"You really mean it...?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I'm not much of one to lie.\"\n\nA huge grin, one that you've never seen before appears on Ken's face.\n\n\"Let's go, Let's go! I want to fly this!\" Ken exclaims as he starts to look for a door handle or something to get inside.\n\nAs Dom goes over to help Ken inside, Micheal goes over to and starts to talk to you a bit.\n\n\"Is this your first ghost?\" He asks with a small smile, though his voice has a hint of seriousness.\n\n\"Yeah, G is helping me fill a quota I guess.\"\n\n\"Lucky you, I haven't heard G ever helping a newbie such as yourself, G usually gets assigned to those already seasoned. You should count yourself lucky to get yourself such a top-rated guide to help you, you could have gotten a dipshit that abandoned you without the drop of the hat, sad that a lot of guides are like that. That class sucks though so I wouldn't blame them.\" Micheal says while rambling a bit.\n\n\"So then do each of you have guides then?\" You ask while you prepare to board the helicopter with Ken and Dom already on board.\n\n\"No, our job lets us not have to count on guides so much since we're able to find our own spirits to help. Which honestly makes the process a whole lot easier in my opinion, then again I had a lot of shit guides when I was first starting out.\"\n\nYou and Dom sat in the back while Ken and Micheal sat in the front of the helicopter.\n\n\"We were actually on planning on going out today before you had called us, so luckily we're going to be able to fly for a little longer while we survey our hotspots,\" Dom explained as Micheal began to start the machine.\n\nIt lifted up slowly but surely as it felt really smooth to what you had imagined the opposite of it being.\n\n\"Once we're done with our hotspots you can choose anywhere you want to go around this area kid, and I'll fly us over.\"\n\n\"Sweet I'd love that!\"\n\nOnce the helicopter had gained enough altitude, it started to soar across the sky as you looked down at the deserts below with fascination. It must have been really easy for these guys to spot people who had died around here with how empty it was beside the cacti everywhere.\n\nA dark feeling clouded your mind as you also imagined them being the first ones to find the actual bodies as well around here, which was a depressing thought.\n\nThe farther out you went, the closer you got to a mountain range that was pretty close by to the airfield.\n\n\"A lot of people go hiking and biking along these trails, and there are only a few park rangers here that actually supervise the place, we actually help a lot of people who end up getting lost here whenever we patrol,\" Dom explains.\n\n\"Do you see anybody now?\" Ken says.\n\n\"No, not really, though no one usually comes here on weekdays, the bikers usually come here on Sunday.\"\n\nAround twenty minutes had passed while you were surveying the mountainside when Dom finally gave the sign to Micheal that it was clear, he started to turn around back to the beginning of the range.\n\n\"Alright kiddo were done with our duties for today, is there anywhere you'd like to go, this helicopter has some pretty good range on it.\"\n\nYou didn't really know why he had given this option since you were in the desert there wasn't really all that many places that you could go to, but you were sure Ken could think of something creative.\n\n\"I want to see the city lights at night! I heard it can be really cool from a plane and I've always wanted too, I've seen a bit before from a mountain but I want to see it from higher!\" Ken states with excitement.\n\nDom and Micheal give each other a look while you cringe a bit. There's no way these guys would stay up flying all night just to do this for Ken.\n\n\"Thomas stays at the airport pretty late helping with refueling right? We can stop by there if that's the case, though you would have to get a ride back to your house from the airport if that's fine with you.\" Micheal says, directing the first part to Dom and the last part towards you.\n\nYou hesitantly nod.\n\n\"Yeah, that won't be a problem.\"\n\nFuck you need to ask G for some Uber money.\n\n\"Well, in that case, you got yourself a ride kid, it should be dark enough for the lights to pop up once we make it to the city.\"\n\nKen's eyes eyebrows widened as he started wiggling in his seat.\n\n\"Since we're also just going to be going in a single direction for a while, I think it's time for you to try out the controllers.\"\n\nTaking this chance at it's fullest, Ken started to slowly grab at the throttle while he was guided by Micheal on where to push and pull.\n\n\"See if you do it like this then it's pretty easy right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it is!\" Micheal beams with satisfaction.\n\nMicheal slowly but surely starts to let go of the throttle for him to grab on his own.\n\n\"Now try to turn us left and right.\"\n\n\"Are you sure...?\" Ken asked a bit nervously.\n\n\"Go ahead, if anything bad happens I have more than enough time to recover.\"\n\nTaking the approval, Ken starts to mess with the throttle and start turning it different directions, although very gingerly and slowly. Though that seemed to be enough to make him very excited.\n\n\"Good job kid! You learned pretty fast, usually, it takes a couple of hours to learn how to use it as a beginner.\"\n\nYou could tell that Micheal was probably bullshitting him which made you laugh a little, but it's not like it really mattered anyway.\n\n----\n\n\"Wow, the sky really is so pretty at night.\" You say as you look down at city nightlife.\n\nKen didn't comment on it when he first saw it, instead of taking it all in, in silence.\n\nThat was probably the only time you've ever seen him this quiet. Nobody else really talked for the rest of that flight, as Micheal took his time hovering over the bustling city below.\n\n--\n\n\"Thank you so much for the ride, I really appreciated that you guys took the time to do this for us.\" You say once you've landed at the airport later that night.\n\n\"No problem kid, it's good to see another one of us in this city. We rarely come in contact with anyone else with our gift so it's always interesting.\" Micheal says.\n\n\"You take care of yourself kid, maybe when you get reincarnated, you can become a pilot with your new life,\" Dom says to Ken.\n\n\"I'm going to be reincarnated?!\" Ken says with disbelief.\n\nDom doesn't answer but instead puts a finger to his lips with a smile, while he and Micheal wave you two goodbye as you leave for the car pickup center of the airport in which you've landed.\n\nYou didn't know if what Dom said was true, or if he was just giving Ken some hope that he would live again after all of this, as long as it made him happy though, then a little false hope was welcome.\n\nYou texted G that you had finished with the ride as you had entered your Uber with Ken.\n\nG- Alright nice, I'm going to have you do the Ascension by tomorrow or the day after, just make sure the kid's mood doesn't fall or anything until then and we'll be fine.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ascension", "result": "The rest of the time until Ken's ascension was pretty fun as it was.

I was really nervous at first about leaving, but after doing everything the last couple of days, I actually feel ready.\" Ken says to you as you stand before him.\n\n\"I'm glad, also hanging out with you was really fun too, you're a pretty cool kid.\"\n\nKen smiles as his hand raises up by your earlier command.\n\n\"Will I be seeing you again...?\" He asks in a much-lowered tone.\n\n\"Probably not anytime soon. But yeah, we probably will see each other again.\" You reply.\n\n\"Well when that day comes, it'll be me showing you around and helping you have fun when you're new!\" He says with a laugh.\n\nThat thought was a little depressing, but it had a sweet enough sentiment to make you smile.\n\n\"Until then.\" You say grabbing his forearm.\n\n\"Until then.\" He replies with a nod.\n\nYou give his forearm a twist.\n\nKen disappears from your eyes shortly after.\n\nYour job was done.\n\nWhile you were a bit sad about it in your now empty room, you were also glad that Ken would finally be getting his rest.\n\nYou would still need to help more spirits to fulfill your quota, and you were committed to making sure they all got to where they were going with smiles and no regrets.\n\nThis was your new life, your new duty.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "How hard will this task be", "result": "\"Well, how hard will all of this be, helping spirits ascend and all.\"\n\nG-Fuck don't tell me you're going to pussy out if this is going to seem like too much work.

Although these needs will actually be more of wants, and these wants can vary in difficulty.

That would only be if you took the back alleys though, and that wasn't really the point of this walk.\n\nMaking your way onto Bradley Ave. you spot the first ghost around thirty yards ahead, facing the opposite direction from you while just huddling down on its knees amidst the oncoming traffic.\n\nThis was one of the ghosts who stuck out to you the most. As it was one of the first road ghosts that you had ever encountered. The other part of it was the fact that its face was heavily disfigured of what you remember. One of the eyes was bulging out like a stress toy, and half of its upper scalp seemed to be completely gone, giving the impression that it painted half of its head red sloppily. You assumed the reason what it was huddled was partially due to the fact that when you had seen it stand, its limbs seemed oddly bent in some angles, and when it had called out to you it hadn't moved at all, but instead crouched down into an animalistic like reflex.\n\nIt's not really like you could communicate with it all that much either with it being in the middle of an avenue and all, you would look like a madman just talking to no one or be mistaken for someone who was trying to jaywalk across.\n\nNevertheless with all these thoughts going into your mind, it was already too late to turn back now, otherwise, you would have been late to first period.\n\nWalking casually, you tried not to make all that much eye contact, and instead were only going to engage if the creature noticed you or called out.\n\nThe closer you came to it, however, the more you started to regret what was about to happen, time seemed to slow a little bit as you could tell that you were now in the peripheral vision of the spirit.\n\nWhat surprised you though was the silence.\n\nIt didn't call out to you.\n\nYou could have sworn that it knew you were able to see if from past interactions, and when it came to ghosts who knew they always called out.\n\nThis sparked curiosity, but also a bit of hesitation.

Seeing the task made you feel pity for the poor thing with how much trouble it seemed to have had.\n\nIt took about half a minute for it to finally reach its barrier, which seemed to be the sidewalk that was next to the road. This led the spirit to be a few feet away from you, in which you could now clearly see it's entirety. It was a girl, or so you thought.

You couldn't tell if it was something like her being bipolar or just all the events that happened in such a short time span. Either way, you still felt sadness for how you left her, and you immediately had plans to go and visit her again on your walk home.\n\nThough on your walk, you had gotten a call from your mom. She chewed you out a little for being marked absent for first period, and you just gave the excuse that you had to go to the bathroom on the way to school and couldn't hold it.

I still got stuff to ask you, like.....when's your birthday and....what's the worst thing that's ever happened to you!\"\n\nThe conversation continued on as Gwen asked you random questions on a variety of topics. It seemed as if she was trying to prolong your stay or at least make it in so that you wouldn't get bored while being with her.\n\nIt's not like you were anyway when it was your turn to ask questions or talk, everything that she replied with genuinely interested you. Still, there was a strange feeling in the pit of your stomach you would get, and it seemed as if it kept on recurring every time you were to interact with Gwen. You pushed it off to the side though as just random nervousness.\n\nChecking your phone you saw that it was already six.\n\n\"Alright, I really got to go now, my mom's going to get pissed if I get back any later.\" You say, trying to excuse yourself out of the conversation as soon as you saw a good stopping point.\n\n\"Yeah, you have been here for quite a while....thanks for deciding to stay a little longer with me though...\" Gwen sweetly smiles you.\n\nDon't worry I'll be back every day at least twice, this route is on my way to school after all.\"\n\n\"I know you will, and I'll be waiting.\"\n\nThose words send a little chill up your spine, though you don't exactly know why. Besides that, you wave Gwen off as you start head back home.\n\nUpon walking into your house, your mom is in the kitchen as she asks you where you've been. You tell her you stayed with some friends to do some stuff after school, and head up to your room before she can try to question you.\n\nYou wake up a bit later than usual the next morning and take your time preparing yourself for school. Somehow the day before had drained you, as you were sluggish to leave the house and go on your walk. In fact, you actually had an inner desire to take the bus and catch a nap for a few minutes but decided against it. Not wanting to do that to Gwen.\n\nWhen you arrive on her street, you catch her looking in your general direction when the two of you make eye contact. You walk at a normal pace until you finally arrive at her boundary.\n\nShe's the first one to say something.\n\n\"You're later than usual.\"\n\nShe didn't say this jokingly, but with a sort of seriousness and matter-of-factness.\n\n\"Yeah....I slept in so I was a little late in getting ready.\"\n\nAs you say this you take out your phone and look at the time.\n\n\"Speaking of which I can't stay all that long either because of it, I can't be late again.\"\n\nAs you say this, you see a deep frown start to form on Gwen's face. She's not even attempting to hide the disappointment that came from what you just said, and because of that, you started to feel guilty.\n\nGwen didn't respond to what you said and just kept on looking at you. Fuck this was really awkward\n\n\"Alright, well I'll see you later then...\"You mutter as you give a little wave. You walk at a normal pace until you feel that you're out of her eyesight, before quickening your pace.\n\nYou don't know why you did this, but you did know you weren't tired anymore. What the hell was that interaction? She was so weird about it that it actually made you genuinely uncomfortable. It wasn't just the guilty feeling, fuck the guilty feeling wasn't the worst part as all. The worst part is that you started having thoughts of just cutting interaction with Gwen, you had ideas why this came to mind, but you didn't know why it came onto you so strong.\n\nYou started to worry that Gwen would be like the past ones, the ones who wouldn't let go if they could help it. Did it just take longer for the signs to show with her compared to the others?\n\nAs more of these thoughts continued to plague your mind, you were eventually able to get rid of them and start trying to feel some compassion in which it seemed you were lacking. Gwen was alone a lot on that street, so it was only natural that she would get upset if it meant less interaction time with you if you were the only person she interacted with. Your apology for it was pretty shitty too, though at the time you didn't really feel the need to, and a part of you still doesn't now.\n\nRegardless you were to visit her again after school since you weren't ready to just abandon her, much reluctance was in you though as you down that street after school as you were contemplating if you had made the right decision or not.\n\nWhen you caught sight of Gwen, she was waving heavily at you, which made you quicken your pace a bit expecting something to be wrong.\n\n\"Hey! You came back!\" Gwen exclaimed, as if you had no intentions of doing so.\n\n\"Of course I did, I said I would.\"\n\n\"Listen I'm sorry about how I reacted earlier today, I acted like a little girl and didn't realize you had your own problems to deal with and such, I was putting myself ahead of you and I'm so sorry!\"\n\nShe was rapid with this apology, and with each word she had taken a step closer to you, causing you to in turn take a few steps back to keep the distance.\n\n\"Don't worry about it really....you have nothing to apologize for.\"\n\n\"I....I just don't want you to think I'm like those other ghosts that you left for being clingy or weird. I'm not like that, I'm.....I'm just lonely!\" Her face twisted into something saddening as features of decay starting to rapidly show all over her body. It seems as if she wasn't able to hold in her emotions as she falls to the ground and starts sobbing, with her whole body shuddering heavily.\n\nYou don't know how to react to this, especially since you're not able to touch ghosts, you can't really comfort her physically. You're still a little shocked with this happening so suddenly, but you get yourself out of it quickly as you try to figure out something to say.\n\n\"Hey...I'm not going to leave you. You got it all wrong man, just because I didn't stick around for that long in the morning doesn't mean I don't want to be here or anything...\"\n\nYou felt that you weren't really good with words, as what you had said didn't really seem to help all that much.\n\n\"I know, or at least I hope you're not lying. But still, these feelings just won't stop. I keep being afraid that you'll decide to leave me and I'll be alone again...Do you have any idea how long I've been on this street?\"\n\n\"Four months?\" You say rememberering your conversation.\n\n\"No...That was a lie. I've been here for about a year maybe more. You're the only person to have talked to me since then. At first, I didn't even think you were real, just a sign that I was actually losing it for real this time. But when you came back I knew you were real, and when there was the chance that you wouldn't be coming back, I got scared. I know I sound like I'm being clingy, well I am clingy. I don't don't want to lose you and I don't want you to go, ever.\"\n\n\n\nAt this point Gwen didn't seem to be holding anything in, as she was letting all her emotions and thoughts out in the rawest form possible. You didn't really know how to feel about this, in one way you felt extreme pity for her, on the other hand a few things in which she admitted made you feel a little dirty. It felt like she was expecting too much from you, there was no way in which you could stay by her side on this street forever, it was heavily impractical. It would have been one thing if it were just a figure of speech, but you knew she was being serious, and that sent chills down your spine.", "action_results": [{"action": "I'll try my best", "result": "Even though you didn't really ask for this responsibility, and you really hated obligations.

I started getting scared that it would keep on shrinking until I had nothing left but a few feet of walking space. Thankfully it never got to that, but it seemed to stop shrinking around the time that you had arrived. You saved me from getting squished, or whatever happens when the barrier closes on itself, but in a small way.....I wish it had. Then everything would finally come to an end.

The whole idea was morbid and gross to think about, but you didn't want to see her suffer anymore, there had to be a way. You had your powers for a reason, and you would be damned if you didn't put them to good use.\n\nThe time that you didn't spend with Gwen, which you had increased by a few hours, was time spent locked in your room as you visited countless supernatural pages.

You just couldn't forget what had happened that day, even if you did come off as strange or weird with what you were doing, you had to get her out of here, she needed freedom from the boundary, at the very least this one.\n\nThere were still two theories left that you could try out to see if it would help Gwen out of her boundary, and thankfully you saved them for last since they looked the most promising getting off of what you had read on them so far.\n\nOne involved doing an old African ritual in which you had to chant some words while holding a couple of ingredients.

You couldn't touch Gwen physically, so you didn't really understand all that well what that meant when it came to exchanging palms.

You were getting the ingredients on separate days individually. They each came in some pretty sketchy looking packages, ignoring this though you started storing everything in your room closet for future use.\n\nNed was actually pretty fast about all of this, more than you were expecting him to be considering that this was all free. You just know that there was a catch to all of this, but you didn't know what it could be, hopefully, he wasn't the devil or something and you had unknowingly signed away your soul for bird droppings and crushed ants.\n\nIt took about two weeks for the final ingredients to come in, to which Ned already knew without you having to tell him.\n\nNed- Alright listen here. I'm going to tell you how to mix these ingredients carefully. All you really need is a stove and something to mix everything with, you might want to throw away the pot after or just thoroughly bleach it or something but that's all on you.\n\n\"I thought the website already gave instructions on how to do everything?\"\n\nNed- You're really going to trust instructions that are run by nerds who think they know our craft? I'll give them credit they got some stuff right, but only about 60% of it, and you need the whole process and ingredients to be perfectly accurate if you're going to make this work. Normally ascending someone would be a snap, but with what we're doing, it's going to be a little more tricky than that.\n\nNed then sends you a list of instructions on how to prepare the potion or drink it was that you would be making.

You didn't even fucking know pots could let out a cold temperature, though will all of this ghost and stalker shit that you have come across you couldn't really be all that surprised.

Still, you think you would be able to finish in time before your dad was to get home since he would probably be here first.\n\nThough as time went on, you got more and more worried that he would catch you in the act, and you had no way in knowing how he would react, and it wasn't like you could just stop what you were doing midway into it.\n\nYou could skip on stirring all the way, and only do it in half the time.

Good, when you're ready for the next steps then get them done and tell me once you're ready to get your girlfriend of that street, there's a whole other process you'll have to go through on that day.\n\nAfter you finished your conversation with Ned, you did whatever homework you needed to do and went straight to bed.

I don't want to see your moping around if you have to stay another year in high school.\" Gwen jokes.\n\nYour earlier excuse was only half a lie, you have been cutting down on schoolwork ever since you started this quest to make what you needed, you really needed to spare some time for school so you wouldn't fall too far behind, though worrying too much about it would only cause a whole other set of problems that you weren't ready to deal with at the moment.\n\nAfter you had said enough to feel content with your meeting, you give her a wave goodbye as you start racing towards school, if she was able to read your expressions with you realizing it, then you didn't want to risk giving anything away that would harm your mission.\n\nTrying to pay a bit more attention in class now that you didn't have to worry about the parts coming in, you were able to do a bit more classwork in order to catch up where you needed to for the week, even with some stern talks with teachers that you had to face during lunch, you're pretty sure it was all going smoothly.\n\n\nYour second meeting on the way home with Gwen seemed to be even shorter than the last one, though she brought up that you had a much better appearance than you did in the morning so she was glad enough to not ask you to stay longer.\n\nIt's not like you wanted to ignore Gwen or anything, you just needed to get this potion done as soon as possible, and getting home earlier meant better opportunities to get the brewing done.\n\nWith your parents away again for the early afternoon, you went straight ahead on starting the preparations to finish half of the potion, getting out all the materials that you needed. You like to think that because you had some experience with it yesterday, you should go a little bit faster now that you knew how all the steps usually went.\n\nOne ingredient after another went into the pot as the steps were followed once again. You were a little more used to the steaming heat, but regardless you had opted to wear a bandanna and a baseball cap while you cooked so you wouldn't be drenched in sweat, or at least have something else to absorb it.\n\nAfter everything, you ended up finishing a half hour early. Since the third part of the recipe was also the smallest, you decided to get it out of the way as well, as you still had plenty of time to go going by when your parents had come home yesterday.\n\nYou felt satisfied by the end of the day with everything completed and you taking a well-deserved rest in your room after bleaching everything moments earlier.\n\nYou could get the last portion done by tomorrow, and the day after you could try out the potion with Gwen to finally get out of that street. Your mind was filled with complete euphoria knowing that everything was turning out in your favor. You never remember being this lucky.\n\nMeeting Ned, finding the correct recipe, having everything shipped to you for free. Everything was going your way, and you enjoyed the hell out of it.\n\n----\n\nFinally, it was all done. The final portion of the recipe really almost fucked you over since you messed up a bit of it when you stirred a little less than you were supposed to causing a different color then was intended after the next ingredient, but the final product looked the same in which you were intending for. You were also very careful upon mixing all the four mixtures, as putting them in the wrong order would cause a different potion. You really had to nuke the pot with bleach afterward because the look of what you just made was very unappealing.\n\nYou had to remember to throw these metal cans you were storing this shit in far far away once you were done with everything.\n\nYou texted Ned the good news about the success of the potion, and he responded almost immediately.\n\nNed- Alright awesome, make sure to get the ritual done tomorrow with your girl, that potion shit isn't something you just want to have sitting around for to long.I'll text you the rest of the shit that you need to do then, just make sure to do it.

The taste is shit, but other than that it's going to help\n\nYou didn't really trust what he was saying all that much considering how it looked and smelled while you were making it, but given that he had much more experience with this than you did, it was going to work.\n\nGwen was waiting for you as usual, while you were already slipping your bag off your back.\n\n\"You got something to show me or something?\" She asks with confusion and curiosity.\n\n\"You could say that,\" you say with a smirk.\n\nTaking out the canister, you carefully start unscrewing the top, keeping it in your other hand so it could be used as a cup.\n\n\"Is that soup or something?\"\n\n\"No it's not, but I want you to drink it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nPouring some of the liquid into the cap, and pushing it in her direction.\n\n\"You're actually serious?\"\n\nYou nod your head.\n\n\"But I don't even think I can...\" she says quietly.\n\n\"Just try for me please.\" You plead with her.\n\nBeing a little hesitant with her hand, she goes out to reach for the cup, which she gingerly grabs, though in both of your surprise that she could even grab it to begin with. Your eagerness rose exponentially as you knew the results of this would be in your favor.\n\nPutting the cup to her lips, she tilted it a bit so that it could fall down her throat, which it did with none of it falling onto the ground. Once the cup was empty, she wiped her lips and handed it back to you, with a weird expression on her face.\n\n\"That tasted a bit funny...\"\n\n\"Yeah sorry about that, though trust me give it a few minutes and it's going to be so much better.\"\n\n\"Could you stop playing with me and just tell me what this is all about.\" She complains with a frown.\n\n\"Of course, I'll tell you everything you want to know after I take my drink.\" You say while pouring some more of the liquid into the cup once again. It looked so unnaturally black and thick that you actually started having some doubts with it yourself on drinking it. Though if Gwen did it you definitely had to do it, so you tilted back your head and put the cup straight to your parted lips, pushing it back along with your head.\n\nYou managed to get it down in one big gulp, though your throat felt like complete shit afterward as you coughed it a bit. Weirdly enough it went down fine, though the coldness it left in your throat was the problem as if you had pushed an entire Popsicle down there.\n\n\"You O.K, it looked like you took that pretty bad,\" Gwen says with a bit of worry.\n\n\"Yeah I'm fine, just wasn't expecting it to taste like that either.\" You laugh a little while wiping your mouth.\n\nSpeaking of which, it had little to no taste, besides the hint of herbs. You had no idea if that should worry you or not, as it was completely different from the smell. Nevertheless, you put that out of your thoughts for a moment as you took out your phone and contacted Ned, telling him that you had both drunk what you needed too.\n\nThough this time you didn't get a reply, at least not one in the span of the next five minutes as you usually did.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Gwen asks.\n\nYou shake your head. \"Nah, just messaging a friend is al-.\"\n\nThe feeling was instant, and you dropped to your knees without any warning.\n\n\"Hey!\" Gwen shouted.\n\nThough your ears started to ring, and you couldn't really much after a few seconds.\n\nIt felt like your body was quickly shutting down, as you were losing the feeling of everything.\n\nYou just wanted to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Drugged", "result": "You didn't know how long exactly you had been out, though by the time you had woken up the sun had already gone down. Though besides the darkness of the sky, the one other thing that had been watching you was Gwen, who was kneeling over her body, her eyes swollen red and her nose runny with mucus.\n\n\"Hey, are you awake!\" She cries as she brings you closer to her face/\n\n\"Ugh...yeah, I think so....what happen?\" You ask while groaning from your massive headache.\n\n\"You fucking passed out for over an hour! What the hell did you drink?\"\n\nFuck, was it really the drink? You would be super pissed and Ned once you got all your senses together.\n\n\"No one stopped their cars to check on a passed out teen?\" You ask, with a little sarcasm.\n\nGwen doesn't seem to answer at first, her eyes darting around with hesitation. This causes you to panic a little.\n\n\"You should probably look now...\" She says.\n\nFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\nGwen grabbed both of your hands and laid them out in front of you so you could see all of your arms. Your heart started beating faster as you saw how they looked.\n\nThey were blue, though that wasn't the problem. Your arms were almost completely transparent, you could see your legs through them. Though the transparency was fading in and out as if it hadn't settled in yet. Looking at the rest of your body, you saw that the same effect was all over.\n\n\"What the fuck happened to me?!\" you say with panic.\n\n\"I don't know! It was probably that drink like I said.....fuck I knew it was a bad idea...\"\n\nYeah, Gwen was totally right about that, but it still really fucking pissed you off. Even though your body was still shifting in and out of reality, you were still able to grab your phone and other things that were in your pockets, backpack included.\n\n'What the fuck did you do to me!'\n\nSending your message to Ned, you awaited a response.\n\nNed- Welcome to the spirit world kid!\n\nThe spirit world?\n\nNed- I know you got a lot of questions kid, and I'm sorry for tricking you like this. But I need you for an experiment I'm doing, and I haven't been able to find another replacement since my last one. Trust me if anything you'll thank me after this is all over with the powers that you'll gain. You'll see me soon, I'm already flying over to get you and your friend. Just hang tight until then.\n\nShit, shit, SHIT.\n\nYou clasped your hands onto your head in frustration as you didn't what the fuck you should do.\n\nGetting up from the floor, you tried out your first intuition and went for the barrier that was always blocking Gwen. You were met with a large solid force that pushed you back as you hit it with your run, and of course, it was the exact same one for Gwen.\n\nYou were a ghost now, there was no denying it.\n\nYou would get that motherfucker Ned back if it was the last thing you were to do. Though the only good thing about all of this was that you hadn't left your body behind and actually died normally, so maybe there was still a chance to get back to your normal state.\n\nNevertheless, you walked back over to Gwen.\n\n\"I have something to tell you, it's going to be a pretty long story....\"\n\nand so you started telling Gwen everything that had happened since you first met Ned, the potion, his promise, and that he was coming here soon.\n\n\"You should of fucking told me this earlier idiot! That sounded sketchy as hell I would have stopped you!\" She chastises you while giving you a push.\n\n\"Yeah I know, but now isn't the time to be playing the blame game OK, he's coming soon and we need to think of a plan to kick his ass.\"\n\nGwen just shook her head as she faced away from you, obviously still pissed about this.\n\n\"OK....Look, I'm sorry about what happened, it's just that I really thought this would work. It was supposed to get you out of here so you could finally leave this street and go wherever you wanted, I really wanted this to work, I'm sorry I fucked us over in the end.\"\n\nGwen gives you a quick look before shaking her head once again.\n\n\"Idiot....next time just tell me these things.\"\n\n\"Promise I will.\"\n\nGwen nods at this, as she walks back over to you.\n\n\"Well, whatever happens, we're going to do this together, no more secrets and no more surprises. If we're going to stop this guy then you can't do any more of that crap, you got to trust in me too.\" She says to you, looking directly into your eyes for confirmation.\n\n\"Together then.\" You nod.\n\nShe smiles, which makes you feel a little bit calmer about everything.\n\nAs long as you were together, nothing would stop you.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Stir halfway", "result": "If your dad were to throw away what you were making then it would all be over, and you had no idea if Ned would be willing to send more ingredients to make up for the ones you had lost, he wouldn't be happy either way.\n\nYou had to cut corners, the people who had done this before had to have done it at least once or twice right?\n\nSo you only stirred halfway through each ingredient that had been entered into the pot.

Lucky you to have gotten such a thing, that class is generally rare to come by. That also seems to answer a few of my questions. So let me ask you, do you really want to get this girl out of her set boundary?\"\n\n\"Yes. more than anything.\"\n\n\"Well then, let me help you with what you need. You were smart enough to find one of the correct ways in order to get the spirits out. Normally most caretakers go the other route instead of this ritual, but this could be relatively easier and faster than that riddle shit in which we would have to go through. Alright, I'll get you all the materials you need, they should come in by the weekend.\"\n\n\"What's the catch?\"\n\n\"No catch, just hurry up and do the ritual.\"\n\nYou didn't really trust what he had just said, there's no way someone could buy this much stuff for that price just from the kindness of their hearts, but then again who were you to say no to free help.\n\n\"How did you know that I could really see ghosts? That I wasn't lying?\" You ask, a bit curious.\n\n\"Our eyes are more....open than others. It's apart of our hierarchy, so don't you go worrying about it.\"\n\n\nAfter you and Ned had finished exchanging messages, he had again said the date in which the materials would be coming, didn't even need to ask for your address which freaked you out quite a bit when he told you that he already knew.\n\nNevertheless, you felt extreme joy for finally being able to get Gwen out of that boundary.\n\n---\n\nNed started messaging on your phone for the rest of the time that you were in contact with him with how the deliveries were going. You were getting the ingredients on separate days individually. They each came in some pretty sketchy looking packages, ignoring this though you started storing everything in your room closet for future use.\n\nNed was actually be pretty fast about all of this, more than you were expecting him to be considering that this was all free. You just know that there was a catch to all of this, but you didn't know what it could be, hopefully he wasn't the devil or something and you had unknowingly signed away your soul for bird droppings and crushed ants.\n\nIt took about two weeks for the final ingredients to come in, to which Ned already knew without you having to tell him.\n\nNed- Alright listen here. I'm going to tell you how to mix these ingredients carefully. All you really need is a stove and something to mix everything with, you might want to throw away the pot after or just thoroughly bleach it or something but that's all on you.\n\n\"I thought the website already gave instructions on how to do everything?\"\n\nNed- You're really going to trust instructions that are run by nerds who think they know our craft? I'll give them credit they got some stuff right, but only about 60% of it, and you need the whole process and ingredients to be perfectly accurate if you're going to make this work. Normally ascending someone would be a snap, but with what we're doing, it's going to be a little more tricky than that.\n\nNed then sends you a list of instructions on how to prepare the potion or drink it was that you would be making. The number of steps was pretty big, though reading through it a couple of times it didn't seem all that hard, just combining a thing or two and stirring for periods of time.\n\nNed had told you to get it done as soon as you could, though you were planning on to anyway.\n\nYou were lucky that your mom had gone out to go do some things were a friend and your dad was still at work. You could get the first quarter of the list done before any of them were to get home and see what you were doing. Unpacking the ingredients you needed, you got straight to work.\n\n---\n\nJesus, the temperature that was emitting from the pot kept on fluctuation from hot to cold. You didn't even fucking know pots could let out a cold temperature, though will all of this ghost and stalker shit that you have come across you couldn't really be all that surprised. It must have been no joke when Ned said that the other faux ingredients wouldn't do, to combining these to make such concoctions took someone who knew what the fuck they were planning on making.\n\nYou were secretly hoping though that this wouldn't explode in your face and destroy the entire house if you did something wrong, Ned didn't say such things would happen, but then again he didn't bring it up.\n\nThe process was slower than you expected it to be as some of the ingredients took awhile to be stirred before they look as if they needed to be going by the instructions. Still, you think you would be able to finish in time before your dad was to get home since he would probably be here first.\n\nThough as time went on, you got more and more worried that he would catch you in the act, and you had no way in knowing how he would react, and it wasn't like you could just stop what you were doing midway into it.\n\nYou could skip on stirring all the way, and only do it in half the time.

At the very least you could try this one first and do the African ritual later. Though you were a bit confused when it came to the part in touching hands, as from what you know that wasn't very possible, and you wanted to make sure you could do it before you started bleeding yourself.\n\nYou tried several times in touching Gwen whenever you two were talking, but each time your hand would go through her body and she would look confused in what you were trying to do. That probably had to do with the fact that you had told Gwen that you had given up on your efforts and to make the best out of what the two of you had. You wanted to surprise her if any of your efforts were to come to fruition so for now, you had to play dumb.\n\nGwen seemed relieved at this as it meant that it would put a stop to your antics and experiments that you would try on her. Maybe she was glad that things were going back to normal. But no matter what lies you told her, you wouldn't stop trying, not until you found a solution to all of this.\n\nYou looked a bit more online as now your research was focused on how to make ghosts physical. You tried your experiments in secret on Gwen as each of them failed as the ones had before. You didn't get far into your research though when similar phrases and words kept on reappearing with each new website that you visited. Apparently increasing a spirits happiness or any kind of a strong emotion, would lead to a bigger connection to the one that caused it.\n\nWell, that's what you interpreted from what you had read. You didn't want to make her to sad or mad, so you would be going with making her happy. But how would you make her happy? Wasn't she happy content enough that you were talking to her every day? She sure seemed like it with her mannerisms and occasional laughter at what you had to say every now and then.\n\nHow happy would you have to make her to get this ritual to work, and would you have to cut your palm right there and then to get it done quickly before her happiness died down?\n\nFuck, you needed to get yourself a pocket knife.\n\nThere weren't many ideas of ways to make Gwen happy that you were able to think of, at least not much that could be done within the confines of her street. You didn't think you could reach the limit of happiness you needed with just words, maybe you could, you just didn't know how.\n\n\"Is there anything that would make you really happy, like anything I could bring you physically for you to see?\" You asked her one day to see if you could get any leads.\n\n\"No not really, please don't tell me you're going on about this again. I told you to forget about that day, I never should have said those things so openly. Please, I'm happy now knowing that you're here with me.\" She pleaded as you frowned a bit.\n\nThere was always the chance that she really was happy, and doing the ritual now was all you needed to do in order for her to ascend. Though something was telling you that it wasn't the case, and you needed to do something big in order to reach the criteria.\n\nThough as you were thinking about her happiness, you started to think about your own, as the thoughts that had been circling your mind earlier for the past few days kept on recurring.\n\nDid you really want to see Gwen go?", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes", "result": "No.\n\nYou weren't about to pussy out of this because you were starting to get second thoughts. That would be incredibly selfish to make Gwen suffer on that shitty street while you knew you could do something about it, as she herself could not.\n\nThere had to be a way, and you would try every way possible.\n\nStarting with this one.\n\n----\n\nYou knew what these feelings were, you'd known them for a while now. You've had them ever since you first started talking to Gwen. As her face got less deformed and you started to talk to her more, the feeling just got stronger and stronger.\n\nYou brushed it off at first as a stupid feeling that you shouldn't have been getting. Though it wouldn't go away, and a lot of the times you couldn't really look at Gwen straight in her eyes without you blushing a few times when she made her usual jokes.\n\nShe really quickly changed from that fragile quiet girl you found on the street to someone filled with personality, who was both funny and caring at the same time. You loved her, yet you still wanted to see her go.\n\nYou hoped to god that this ritual wouldn't send her off, maybe at best it would let her free roam around the planet to her heart's content. But even then, that would be dreadful.\n\nIf that were to happen then you would need to be with her to keep her company, or at least find other ghosts that could do it as well if she were to get tired of you. Because of all this, you had been delaying the ritual for a few weeks already, it was about to be a month now, as each day went on you kept on hating yourself more and more, though it's not like in that time did you have an opportunity to make her euphoric.\n\n\nAs these thoughts kept on running through your head, an idea came into view.\n\nMaybe if you told her that you loved her, that would make the spark you needed for the experiment to come together. Thinking it over it did sound really self-centered and cliche, but it was really worth a shot, and you wanted to convey your feelings before anything was to happen if she were to disappear or ascend without you knowing or being able to say your final goodbyes.\n\nThis led to a whole other set of problems as you started pussyfooting around the whole confession. Although to be fair you weren't exaggerating when you said it had to be perfect, in more than two ways. You had to make sure you did it with enough finesse to swoon her over, and you had to be agile enough to make the cut and start the ritual, or at least persuade her into doing it for you without having to trick her.\n\nThis isn't something that you could redo at a later day, it was all or nothing with this.\n\nThough with enough planning and patience, and the knife that had taken a while to get shipped from Amazon, you had planned for your confession and the ritual to fall on the day of Friday.\n\nWith each passing day you rehearsed what you were planning on saying in your head countless times, and making sure that Gwen wasn't in a bad mood or anything that would ruin your surprise if she kept up with it for the entire week.\n\nWhen it finally came to Friday, you were really fucking nervous about how everything would turn out. Like an edgy school shooter emo, you had been fake practicing the cut in the mirror to be as quick and precise as possible. You were really bad when it came to pain so that would probably be the worst part out of this whole experience.\n\nIt would be on your walk home when you would confess, and you waited a little bit later before actually starting your walk since you were wanting to do it a bit towards the time that the sun would lower. The last thing you needed was someone calling the cops because they saw a kid cut his wrist.\n\n--\n\n\"You're a little late, did anything happen at school?\" Gwen asks.\n\n\"Yeah had to stay behind for a bit of tutoring is all.\" You lie with a smile.\n\n\"Ah, well that's good, I'm glad you're actually doing something about it now, with how tired you look every morning I could have guessed with how you were doing in school.\"\n\n\n\"Is it really that obvious...\" You frown.\n\nShe laughs. \"No don't feel bad about it, I'm just really good at reading expressions and all.\"\n\nYou couldn't really tell if you were actually acting like that, or if it was just apart of your fake act from your earlier meetings.\n\nForgetting about that for a moment, you started to think of your words.", "action_results": [{"action": "Start slowly", "result": "\"Gwen, for the time that we've known each other, what do you think of me...\" You ask while looking away a bit.\n\nThough you see her smirk a little.\n\n\"What brought on that type of question?\"\n\n\"Just wondering.\"\n\nShe seems to think for a moment, seeming to choose her words slowly.\n\n\"Well....you were really nice to me. Yo still are, but I'm glad you stopped being super nice after that one day. You also really care about being on time here, which I appreciate....so I guess I think you're OK.\"\n\nHNNNNNNGGGGG.\n\n\"Just OK?\" You say half-jokingly, although on the inside being completely serious.\n\nShe gives you a sly look with her eyes.\n\n\"Well tell me then, what do you think of me?\" she asks.\n\n\"I think you're OK.\" You reply with a smile.\n\n\"Oh fuck off, don't make me say that embarrassing stuff and you not do the same.\" She said slightly annoyed.\n\n\"Well....I think you're a pretty cool ghost. You're very interesting to talk too, and you have a good sense of humor about things. You care about....well what happens to me and my school work so there's that too, I guess.\" Your carefully picked words cause Gwen's face to shift in a certain way. You couldn't tell if it was from embarrassment or something else, but she also couldn't seem to make eye contact with you either.\n\n\n\"Gwen, I.....well I really like you.\"\n\nYou didn't really know what to say after that, your mouth kind of dried up the point in which you didn't feel as if you could get anything else out of your throat.\n\n\"Uh-h well...\" You heard Gwen's reaction sounded stiff and hoarse.\n\n\"W-Well I like you to I g-guess!\" Gwen was a little bit louder with how she said it, trying to laugh along with it after saying it, though it sounded extremely unnatural.\n\n\"Fuck I made things weird didn't I, I'm sorry.\" you apologize sheepishly.\n\n\"No! Please don't. I mean yeah it is kind of awkward the way you said it. I would have worded it a bit differently I mean, but.....well I really do have the same feelings.\" she replies, a bit sturdier with her voice.\n\n\"Well....I...It's more than just liking....I love you...\"She finishes after a brief pause.\n\n\"I loved you when you first came here and decided to stay.....you could of walked away but you stayed the first time and that's all that really took....I hated when you weren't here, and I always looked forward to our little talks, even if they weren't for that long. Maybe because they were so short is why I treasure them so much. I like to hear about your day, I want to know about your problems, I just want....I want to be with you...\"\n\nMan, she was doing a better job than you were doing with this confession. She didn't even lose eye contact when she said that last part, her facial expression was one of seriousness, she didn't laugh that last bit off.\n\n\"I love you too....That's why....Well that's why I want to help you. If it's just one way that could bring us together, or let you have your peace. I don't care if you say you don't want it, I'm doing what I'm doing because I care about you, and if a day comes where I have to stop coming that's out of my own control, then I don't want you to be here all alone, at the very best, I want you to be with me.\" You say, trying your best to sound as sincere as possible with your antics.\n\n\"Well, I know that you have my best intentions in your heart, just please don't get yourself hurt over it, that's the last thing I want.\"\n\nShit.\n\n\"Well that's the thing, please listen to me through before you say anything though.\" You plead as you see her facial expression darken as she hears this from you.\n\n\"I'm going to try a ritual, which just involves he drawing a little blood. After that we just need to hold hands while I say a chant. Afterward, I think you'll be able to walk free and go with me wherever I go. I want that more than anything, to just be with you outside of this street, and I think this way is going to work.\"\n\nHer attitude on this seems mixed as she seems hesitant about it, although you're already taking out your knife as you flip it open.\n\n\"Wait! How do you know this is going to work?\" Gwen hastily asks.\n\n\"I honestly really don't, but I'm going to try either way. I'm not just doing this for you either, I'm doing it for me.\" You joke as you reflexively wince while making the cut. Although you make sure to not do it too deep that it would be dangerous or worry Gwen to an extreme level, though blood was easily flowing now if you tipped your wrist over sideways.\n\nYou raised out your hand for Gwen to grab.\n\n\"Let's try it out Gwen, me and you. You just need to grab my hand.\" You say.\n\nAgain she seems to hesitate. Though much less now as she seems to make up her mind in less than a minute.\n\n\"OK. Together then.\"\n\nGwen reaches for your hand as your heart beats rapidly, as if ready to explode from your chest.\n\nYou feel contact, as her cold clammy hand meets with yours. Your stomach drops as your knees begin to buckle, but you stand as firm as you can as you start to remember the chant.\n\nThe words escape your mouth as you look up a little into the sky. You change your gripping from her hand to her forearm as you speed up the chant.\n\nGwen grips you harder as she looks down.\n\nThe chant ends as you finish saying what you needed to say.\n\nYou don't feel anything different, and that makes you start to panic internally.

Even if she couldn't leave this boundary, the of you being able to make physical contact was already enough to make you happy.\n\nHer hand raised up as it shook with nervously, moving it closer to yours, she grabbed your hand.\n\nShe grabbed your hand.\n\nOutside of the boundary.\n\nThe two of you froze for a moment as nothing was said. Though immediately afterward, you felt your body push back as a large amount of weight fell on top of you from the front. Falling on your ass, you felt arms embrace around torso while loud wails pierced your ears. Gwen was crying, and she was really letting it all out as you felt your shoulder be soaked with tears.

You hugged Gwen back as you let her cry out what she needed to cry out, rubbing her back to console her a bit.\n\n\"It worked....>I-It really worked!\" She cried into your ear.\n\nMaybe you should have been crying too, but your face just felt numb as you realized what you did actually worked, maybe deep down you expected nothing out of this, and to have it actually work just shook you.\n\nThough you knew, that now, everything was going to be OK.\n\nYou got Gwen off the street.", "action_results": [{"action": "Later", "result": "You and Gwen talked throughout the night at your house.

Though you would have to wait until tonight to actually get there when you wanted to get there.\n\nHanging out at your house and just talking for most of the morning, you got some money from your wallet and told your mom you would be coming back later tonight, saying you would be out with friends and getting a ride home from them.\n\nPaying for a bus fare you and Gwen traveled to a local mountain in which people usually hiked at. Though you didn't tell her the destination since you wanted it to be a surprise. You didn't think ghosts could get fatigued either, though it wasn't really that long of a climb so no need to worry about it.\n\nUpon arriving, there were only a few cars parked in the parking lot. The mountain didn't have a closing time, or at least this trail didn't you think. You already took the precaution of taking a flashlight too for the way down, since you would be up here until nightfall.\n\n\"We're going hiking? That's so lame, It's late too.\" Gwen complained.\n\n\"Stop being such a baby, there's something cool to see up top.\"\n\n\"You know what else is cool? Taking your ghost girlfriend to go see a movie or something.\"\n\n\"Maybe if you appreciate my thoughtful trips I'll take you when I feel like it.\" You joke.\n\nShe smirks. \"Ass.\"\n\nReaching the top of the mountain, you continued on at the little plateau that was on the top in which you could look at everything.\n\n\"Wow, the view from here is pretty...\" Gwen says with admiration.\n\n\"Yeah, but it gets even better.\" You say.\n\nShe asks why, but you change the topic, and just begin to talk about random topics for the next couple of hours.\n\nLuckily there weren't that many people who came upon this mountain top at this time of day, only a few others you saw though they went to the other side of the area, whether that to avoid the crazy man talking to himself you had no idea.\n\nAs the last bits of rays were disappearing in the horizon, the view that you had been waiting for came into full effect as you stopped the conversation that was going on and pointed towards the view, to which Gwen had been oblivious too until now.\n\nAn audible \"Woah\" escaped her lips as she saw what you were seeing.\n\nCountless city lights had brightened up buildings as far as the eye could see since downtown wasn't that far away, you were able to see how beautiful the skyscrapers could be.\n\n\"It's so pretty...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I came up her once during one time when I was climbing with my uncle, it's something I really wanted to see again.\"\n\nThe two of you continued to look in silence as your arm was wrapped around the shoulder of Gwen.\n\nYou had no idea how things would go from here, you finished what you needed too and you got what you wanted.

You're very interesting to talk too, and you have a good sense of humor about things. You care about....well what happens to me and my school work so there's that too, I guess.\" Your carefully picked words cause Gwen's face to shift in a certain way.

Please don't. I mean yeah it is kind of awkward the way you said it.

I like to hear about your day, I want to know your problems, I just want....I want to be with you...\"\n\nMan, she was doing a better job than you were doing with this confession. She didn't even lose eye contact when she said that last part, her facial expression was one of seriousness, she didn't laugh that last bit off.\n\n\"I love you too....That's why....Well that's why I want to help you.

After that we just need to hold hands while I say a chant. Afterwards, I think you'll be able to walk free and go with me wherever I go. I wan't that more then anything, to just be with you outside of this street, and I think this way is going to work.\"\n\nHer attitude on this seems mixed as she seems hesitant about it, although you're already taking out your knife as you flip it open.\n\n\"Wait! How do you know this is going to work?\" Gwen hastily asks.\n\n\"I honestly really don't, but I'm going to try either way. I'm not just doing this for you either, I'm doing it for me.\" You joke as you reflexively wince while making the cut. Although you make sure to not do it too deep that it would be dangerous or worry Gwen to a extreme level, though blood was easily flowing now if you tipped your wrist over sideways.\n\nYou raised out your hand for Gwen to grab.\n\n\"Let's try it out Gwen, me and you.

Together then.\"\n\nGwen reaches for your hand as your heart beats rapidly, as if ready to explode from your chest.\n\nYou feel contact, as her cold clammy hand meets with yours. Your stomach drops as your knees begin to buckle, but you stand as firm as you can as you start to remember the chant.\n\nThe words escape your mouth as you look up a little into the sky. You change your gripping from her hand to her forearm as you speed up the chant.\n\nGwen grips you harder as she looks down.\n\nThe chant ends as you finish saying what you needed to say.\n\nYou don't feel anything different, and that makes you start to panic internally. Gwen slowly starts to look back up as her grip on your wrist begins to loosen, so does yours.\n\n\"D-Do you know where you boundary is?\" You stammer, not giving up on your hopes that something had changed.\n\n\"Yeah, that fence is where I usually can't pass through....\" She says quietly.\n\nBoth of you start walking towards the fence, though your pace is slow as it's hard to move your feet with how weak they feel, while Gwen is right beside you at the same speed.\n\nWhen you reach the fence, you both pause.

There's no way she would be on that street forever, though until that time would come you would just keep her company to the best of your ability.\n\nHopefully, by the time it was time for you to graduate, she would already be off in whatever waited for her.

The next few weeks are spent getting back on track on school work to which you end up putting yourself ahead in some classes. Your conversations with Gwen continue, and you're much more cheery and happy with them, to which Gwen notices herself and tells you.\n\nWeeks turn into months as the meetings never really got boring for you, but instead, you started to feel a stronger connection with her.

On it though you start to think about Gwen. Not so much of thoughts of interest, but thoughts of worry. With what she just asked for, she seemed incredibly lonely. That was a given though since you were her only source of interaction. In fact her attitude was probably tame in comparison to other spirits who had no other interaction, she wasn't screaming like a maniac compared to the others, so she was more approachable.\n\nYou would need to keep your promises though to visit her everyday, at least once. You felt as if you would be super guilty if you tried to avoid her or promised her something that you wouldn't be able to keep.\n\nThough a more pressing matter was limiting your conversations so you wouldn't end up being late to school anymore, because the excuse you had given your mom would only probably work just that one time.\n\nAs the sun slowly sank into the horizon, you finally managed to get home, aside from the questioning from your mom nothing else comes up and you get ready for bed.\n\n\nThe next day you quickly wake up from bed and get hurriedly get ready to save as much time as possible.

You weren't sure at first, but after these meetings with her you could always catch yourself smiling during conversations and could see the same with her.\n\nTwo weeks had passed as you continued your visits before and after school. With each interaction, the times that Gwen would become sad or bring up something depressing would start to slowly decrease until they were abnormal occurrences to happen.\n\nYou never seemed to run out of things to talk about or bring up, or if you did yourself, Gwen would change the topic to start something new. It would get to the point in which you would actually become sad when your meetings were over, there were even some times you hadn't even noticed the sun had gone down until she herself brought it up, and suggested that you get yourself home.\n\nShe didn't usually do this, but there had been occurrences in which passerby's in cars would stop by the curb in which the two of you were and ask you if you were O.K, as people had seen you continuously here each day and were worried that you were lost or sick or something.\n\nYou had always given the excuse that you were waiting for someone or you just wanted to loiter like a normal teen, most of them bought the excuse although leaving with a troubled expression on your behalf.\n\nYou didn't really care all that much though if you were being judged, as long as you were able to talk to Gwen. Another thing that you had noticed was that all the scars, wounds, and rotten flesh had been starting to disappear with each returning visit, until it got to the point in which you didn't see it at all.\n\nYou never would have imagined that you would feel a romantic feeling towards a ghost. Since you always saw them as ugly creatures that plagued this world with the curse of not being able to move on.\n\nYou wanted to help Gwen, somehow help her out of that street. On the other hand though you didn't want to lose her, being with her was fun, and even though it hadn't been that long, you couldn't really imagine not being with her.\n\nThere had to be a way in which you could help her without letting her go. Somehow to get her off that street, if it was even possible.\n\nYou tried to imagine something but nothing came to mind, which frustrated you immensely. It's not like she would know of anything either, she knew just about as much as you did on her condition.\n\nYou tried to stop thinking about such depressing matters, until it was brought up in one of your conversions by Gwen unexpectedly.\n\n\"Do you think I'll be here forever...\" She asked in a shallow voice, after of series of other unrelated questions.\n\n\"I doubt it, nothing lasts forever...\"\n\nYou said this, but when you did you wished you hadn't. You had basically said that you and Gwen would eventually come to a end as well, which may be true but still. You looked at her facial expression to see if she caught up on this, but you couldn't tell with how expressionless it was.\n\n\"Yeah, that's true...\"\n\n\"Who knows what will happen though, it's not like we know for certain what's going to happen to you or which god is going to judge your fate, but I'm sure wherever you're going, it's going to be something enjoyable.\" You try to comfort her with possibilities.\n\nThis causes Gwen to laugh, which catches you off guard a bit.\n\n\"You know, before I died. I thought I was turning atheist with all the thoughts that were coming to my head at the time. I didn't really fear death all that much since I thought it would all just be over in a bright flash, and I would be able to sleep forever....now though.\"\n\nTears start to well up in Gwen's eyes as she starts wiping them with her palm.\n\n\"If only you had seen me the first couple of weeks when I was like this. How hard I screamed, how shitty I felt. Looking back on it even I knew was acting insane. I don't know when it happened, but after awhile I stopped feeling, I stopped caring.

I started getting scared that it would keep on shrinking until I had nothing left but a few feet of walking space. Thankfully it never got to that, but it seemed to stop shrinking around the time that you had arrived.
