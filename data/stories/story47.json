I need to share you with everyone...", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the past...", "result": "You haven\u2019t eaten anything since early this morning and the walls of your stomach are grinding together. You have to get your mind off of it somehow and the water fountain on the far wall beckons to you.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the road for days and it feels like the better part of it has been planted in this seat\u2014even though you\u2019ve only been here for the last couple of hours. The skin on your back and the backs of your bare legs rip free of the hard plastic seat as you stand and your flip-flops slap and smack your heels as you plod across the room.\n\nYou freeze midway when you see a cowboy roping a calf from horseback. It\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\u2019ve seen for days even if it is only a poster. And it\u2019s not the only one! Scanning the room you see many, many more of far off magical places with waterfalls and cliffs and mountains and dark caverns. Some of cityscapes with towering buildings and some at night with only the lights on and still more of endless rolling plains.\n\nFrom somewhere behind you, you hear a garbled voice fighting it\u2019s way through crackling static, droning on and on about things that only old people care about. You zero in on the source and discover that it is a tiny coin operated radio affixed to the arm of a terminal seat. Neat!\n\nJust then a clammy hand clamps down on the back of your neck and you\u2019re whisked toward the double glass doors. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go, mister,\u201d comes the all too familiar voice of your mom and she only releases her grip\u2014with a surprise thrust that causes you to whack your shin on the bottom step\u2014to allow you to clamber up and into the bus on your own.\n\nA shiver runs down your spine and the back of your arms prickle as you make your way down the aisle between tall and comfy-looking seats. You\u2019re not used to air conditioning and it brings both pain and relief.\n\nYou pass by an elderly couple. The woman looks up and smiles at you warmly so you give her a wide berth. You doubt that she would, being a stranger and all, but you sure don\u2019t want her squeezing your cheek like Grandma does.\n\nYou\u2019re nudged into the row behind them and you take the farthest seat. Your mother sits beside you and puts the bag with everything the two of you own at her feet. Her lips are pursed and her eyes drawn. She\u2019s been tired every day since the divorce and when she gets tired, she gets mad. You have a hard time even recognizing her now.\n\nA hiss and a lurch later, the bus pulls out onto the highway and with your face plastered to the side window you watch as the fence posts strobe past with only the occasional bush or sapling breaking the pattern.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d remarks the old man to his wife, \u201cand it looks to be a bad \u2018un.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d she replies absently, not bothering to look up from her needlepoint.\n\nYour eyes drift upward from the fence to a draw on the horizon and there the sky is beginning to boil and bristle with blue-white sparks. You can\u2019t shake the feeling that you are at the very beginning of the greatest adventure\u2014and worst nightmare\u2014of your life.\n\nAfter only a mile or two, the droning of the engine and the rhythmic beat of its tires thumping over the seams in the concrete soothes you to sleep and you sleep the whole rest of the way.\n\n\n\nYou are shaken from a pleasant dream of opening Christmas presents with your parents to stumble and trip over your feet as you\u2019re dragged toward the front of the bus. It pulls over, dumping the two of you out on a deserted street.\n\nYou know it\u2019s only your reflection, but the ghastly and pale boy is all you can make out in the store window before you. It brightens and fades, brightens and fades with each pulse of the stoplight on the corner. You take a step backward and the wind from the bus pushes you forward as it pulls away.\n\n\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to get yourself run over?\u201d Your mother cups the back of your head and shoves you toward the boy with hollow eye-sockets, \u201cGet over there and sit down against the wall.\u201d\n\nYou do as your told, although you can\u2019t help but look up at the glass expecting him to be standing there looking down at you.\n\nAn eternity goes by with your mom standing slumped against a signpost and staring off into the night.\n\nYour butt burns as the bones chew their way to the cement. You rock slowly from one side to the other to relieve the pain and she flashes her eyes at you. You melt.\n\n\u201cSit there and don\u2019t move,\u201d she barks as she leaps toward the flashing light. A car has stopped at the corner and she waves her arms as she sprints toward it. It begins to pull away, but stops short and the window tentatively rolls down.\n\nYou can\u2019t make out her words, but there\u2019s happiness in your mother\u2019s voice again as she crouches there with her elbows propped against the car door. Maybe she\u2019s not mad anymore. You stretch your legs out as far as you can and wiggle your toes.\n\nShe stands as the car pulls away and turns toward you. You can\u2019t see her face, but there\u2019s no mad in her walk now. You let out a long breath in relief.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve found us a place to sleep tonight,\u201d she beams snatching up the bag, \u201cand tomorrow I start job huntin\u2019. We\u2019re gonna do jus\u2019 fine you an\u2019 me. You wait an\u2019 see.\u201d She wraps her arm around your shoulders and the two of you skip off around the corner and into the crisp night air.\n\n\n\nYou sit with your shoulders slumped, dragging your feet in a circle as the swing\u2019s chains lazily wind and unwind and then wind up again. You\u2019ve already walked around the park twice and sat on everything here so now all you can do is wait.\n\n\u201cYou wait here an\u2019 watch our stuff,\u201d your mom had told you, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to do today an\u2019, with any luck, things\u2019ll be a whole lot better from now on. And don\u2019t you leave the park! You hear me? I\u2019ll be back as quick as I can.\u201d\n\nYour stomach grumbles. The two half-crushed cheese and peanut butter crackers your mom gave you before she left didn\u2019t do much to satisfy it. At least the gnawing emptiness is gone.\n\nYou hear a squeal and giggles so you look up. Some little kids are playing in the dirt at the bottom of the slide as if it were a sandbox. A dozen steps away from them sits a plump woman with her nose in a book.\n\nYou survey the park for other signs of life and spot a group about your age. Three boys in a circle around a dark-haired girl. They\u2019re pushing her back and forth between them like some demented form of \u2018Hot Potato\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d jeers the fat one.\n\n\u201cYeah, you ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere you little bastard,\u201d cracks the snotty runt.\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d she hisses, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d\n\nThe tallest of the three quakes from head to toe and nearly loses his breath in a fit of really annoying breathy laughter as he shoves her back toward the other two.\n\nThe girl turns beet red from anger and lashes out with flailing, non-connecting slaps which only seems to feed the boys\u2019 hysterical laughter.\n\nYou have the sudden urge to attack them, but that might be a little hasty. Perhaps you should find some other way.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wade into 'em", "result": "\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d you command as you trot over to them with more brass than you really possess, \u201cYou like picking on little girls?\u201d\n\nTheir shock fades instantly when they see you and Chortle begins to jiggle. They either aren\u2019t that impressed by you in the slightest or they\u2019re extremely good at hiding it.\n\nChortle grapples the girl as Tubby strides up to you, heeled closely by Snots. You suddenly feel smaller and more helpless than at any other time in your life, but you refuse to show any sign of it.\n\n\u201cWho are you?!\u201d demands Snots.\n\n\u201cIs this your little girlfriend?\u201d jeers Tubby, \u201cHave you come to rescue her?\u201d\n\nYou feel your face flush red, but not from embarrassment. You are livid!\n\n\u201cLook here, this guy\u2019s here to save his bastard girlfriend,\u201d spits Snots.\n\nYou lunge forward and Tubby grabs you in a meaty \u201cbear hug\u201d, but not before you put your fist in Snots\u2019 mouth. He falls back in horror with a tooth dangling below his upper lip and starts tearing up.\n\nTubby swings you around in an arc and falls on you with every ounce of his weight knocking the wind completely out of you.\n\nYou struggle against his massive frame, kicking and thrashing, but there is no escape. It\u2019d take a bulldozer to move this tub o\u2019 guts.\n\nHe crawls upward and pins your arms with his fat legs and starts drilling your forehead with his meaty finger. \u201cWanna be a tough guy, huh?\u201d\n\nThe girl manages to land one of her backward kicks and Chortle falls like a sack of potatoes, screaming in agony as his face goes purple. She turns and darts between two houses on the far side of the street.\n\n\u201cGet her,\u201d wheezes Chortle, \u201cGet that little bastard!\u201d\n\nSnots runs to his aid and tries to pull him to his feet between sobs, but can\u2019t muster the strength. Chortle is in no condition to stand just yet anyhow.\n\nTubby turns back to you and pounds a couple of stinging blows to the side of your face, then smooshes your head into the soft earth as he hoists his lard back to his feet and saunters over to his friends.\n\nYou roll onto your belly, push yourself up and limp away in the other direction.\n\nLooking over your shoulder to make sure the trio aren\u2019t watching, you dash between houses and start making your way back toward where the girl went through.\n\nThe alley is shrouded by trees arching overhead and you make your way to the end of it. Seeing no sign of her, you cut through to the next street. Still nothing. She\u2019s long gone.\n\nYou suddenly remember the bag tucked under the picnic table that you were supposed to be watching. If something happened to it, you\u2019ll be in big trouble.\n\nYou sprint like the devil is after you. A hedge claws up your arms and face as you dart through it, which you barely even notice.\n\nTurning down the alley, a dark figure steps out from behind the corner of the hedge directly in your path. Your mouth goes all coppery and dry, and you skid to a stop.\n\nYou\u2019re all set to flee when you realize that it\u2019s the girl from before. She looks sheepish and a bit winded, but no worse for wear.\n\nShe hangs her head, but her eyes remain fixed on yours. As you cautiously approach her, you detect the faint hint of a smile.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she barely more than whispers.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYeah. They didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure hurt that one.\u201d\n\nShe chuckles.\n\n\u201cWho were them boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust some boys from school. They always pick on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust \u2018cause. They\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you ask, scrunching your toes and noticing how dirty they\u2019ve gotten.\n\n\u201cJane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cBilly. We just moved here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, turning her gaze to the side, then back to you. \u201cMy house is on Hill Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that is.

See ya later.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee ya later.\u201d\n\nYou cut between two houses following their shared ribbon driveway.

It\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\n\nShe unrolls a paper bag and slams down a small boat of shriveled, dried up shrimp and a larger one half full of crispy fries (the small ones that no one wants and are generally tossed out instead of being served to customers).\n\nYou begin to pick at them one by one, but your hunger soon takes over and you start to cram them into your mouth by the handful.\n\n\u201cSlow down. They\u2019re all yours. I had mine already on the way back,\u201d she says in a more pleasant tone. \u201cI got a job today.

The filthy carpeting is littered in bits of trash and the furniture is piled high with wadded clothing. The air is a stale mixture of cigarette smoke and vomit. You manage to quell your gag reflex by taking shallow breaths in through your mouth.\n\nShe watches you for a minute or two as you look around and says \u201cIt\u2019s just a house.\u201d After another minute she says \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou help her drag the door closed and are stepping off the porch when she suddenly stops and says \u201cWait.

It\u2019s where I keep all my important stuff.\u201d\n\nYour eyes finally adjust to the dim light and you can see she\u2019s cradling a cigar box tied with a ribbon as she crawls past you to the opening. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\nShe begins pulling the contents out one by one and handling them gingerly. \u201cThis is me and Gramma when I was little,\u201d holding out a yellowed Polaroid of a grim-faced woman holding the hand of a toddler, \u201cand this is when I went to her house when momma went to the hospital,\u201d showing you a slightly fresher one that\u2019s probably only a couple years old, at most. There are several more and all with the same grim-faced woman standing with Jane, holding her hand.\n\nThere are several black-and-white postcards with scenes from various parks and tourist attractions. Each one is addressed to Jane and tells what a wonderful time her Gramma is having and signed \u2018Love Gramma\u2019.\n\nThen there are a few fancy buttons and ribbons and such things that in all likelihood have sentimental value known only to her.\n\nYou smile and nod as she excitedly tells you about every detail. The most interesting to you are the pictures on the post cards. They pull at something primal inside of you and you feel a strange longing to see many of the places for yourself.\n\nAfter she has quieted down a bit you say \u201cI don\u2019t have anything important anymore. We lost everything we had moving around so much and now we have to start all over.\u201d\n\nJane\u2019s expression grows dark and she only looks at you without saying anything for the longest time which makes you very uncomfortable.

She gently places her treasure chest back in its place and says \u201cThe boys are probably long gone by now so we can go back to your house.\u201d\n\nYou crawl out behind her and she puts the grate back in place. The two of you walk in silence and you can\u2019t figure out for the life of you why she\u2019d ever sleep under her house instead of inside it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wishes and Secrets", "result": "When you get back to Honey\u2019s house, the first thing you do is run into the garage and grab your muffin. It\u2019s almost dinnertime now and your stomach has started to complain. You tear it in two as carefully as you can and say \u201cHere,\u201d handing Jane the slightly larger half, \u201cIt\u2019s all I have so we\u2019ll have to share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFahnk mhu,\u201d Jane says through a mouthful, beaming at you, as she tears into her half like a wild animal that hasn\u2019t eaten in days.\n\nAfter inhaling your half, you wipe your hands on your cut-offs. Jane smirks and wipes her hands off on your shorts, too. You jump back in shock and she tackles you\u2014straddling you and instantly pinning your wrists down above your head. You are caught completely by surprise! This is the first time she\u2019s been physical with you and you aren\u2019t exactly sure how to react.\n\nYou decide to play along by feigning escape. She giggles maniacally and pushes your head back down with her own. You stare into her wild eyes as you wriggle about and her shrieks of excitement grow louder and louder. Her eyes are the color of new grass and despite her current playfulness, reveal that she is much older than her years. Her hair is long and oily black and shimmers blue in the sun. For the first time you notice how beautiful she is.\n\nThrough squeals and giggles she begins pecking kisses all over your face. The more you pretend to struggle the more she seems to enjoy it.\n\nHer expression suddenly changes to one of extreme seriousness and her eyes narrow. She dives in and gives you a big smacking smooch right on the cheek. You freeze for an instant before rolling out from under her and dashing around the swing set\u2014keeping it between you and her as some kind of protective barrier. Every time she darts one way, you go the other and her shrill laughter only increases.\n\nShe chases you all around the yard in a one-sided game of tag. You are quite a bit faster than she is so you can easily stay out of her reach. She really seems to enjoy the pursuit and she\u2019s unwilling to give up her quarry.\n\nEventually, things settle down some and the two of you sit in the swings where you manage to catch your breath. She\u2019s still smiling devilishly at you so you keep your guard up and watch her warily from the corner of your eye.\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s your mom coming home?\u201d Jane asks.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bout dark, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWanna go get another pop?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to return the bottles \u2018cause I\u2019m all out of quarters.

She flops over onto it and stretches her legs out, crossing her ankles.\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d you say, rolling over and laying your head down beside hers, stretching your legs out in the opposite direction.\n\nThe warmth of her ear and cheek are comforting to you as you stare up into the darkness trying to make out the floorboards. Her steady, rapid breathing gradually slows and your eyes start to glaze over. You haven\u2019t had an afternoon nap since you were in kindergarten, but you are beginning to see their appeal.\n\nJane finally breaks the silence in a soothing tone, \u201cGramma has a giant photo book filled with pictures of all kinds of neat places she\u2019s been to from all over the country. My favorite ones are from her honeymoon to the Grand Canyon. She was just a girl back then\u2014even younger than Momma.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like mountains,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a big hole in the ground a mile deep.

I\u2019m gonna see everything in Gramma\u2019s book for myself.\u201d\n\nEven in the dark and with your eyes closed you can feel the smile on her face, but it\u2019s short-lived and her voice becomes a hoarse whisper, \u201cI wish I could live someplace else. Momma hates me. Gramma told me that Momma was in love with a boy that didn\u2019t love her back. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have a Daddy and why Momma couldn\u2019t even look at me when I first got borned. The doctor named me Jane \u2018cause that\u2019s what they call girls when they don\u2019t know their name.\u201d\n\nThe feeling you had of drowsiness has completely and utterly faded now.

Nineteen bottles at three cents apiece\u2026 That comes to fifty-seven cents. Does that sound right to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds right to me,\u201d Jane beams back at him, \u201cCan I get it in quarters so we can buy pops?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing. Let me just put \u2018em in the crates and then I\u2019ll get you your money,\u201d he says, stepping from behind the counter and walking over to stacks in front of the big plate window in front.\n\nWhile his back is to her, Jane snatches a Moon Pie from the impulse buy rack and slips it into the fold of her tied shirt.\n\nStepping toward her, you whisper \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that. What if he catches you?\u201d You glance over to see if the man noticed and, sure enough, you see that he\u2019s watching her in the convex mirror hanging up front in the corner.\n\nBefore you can say anything, he\u2019s already back at the register and putting the bottles in the crates he\u2019s brought back with him.\n\nYou\u2019re shaking like a leaf and expect him to drop the hammer at any second, but all he does is smile at you knowingly and wink. He turns toward the register, pushes a button to release the tray, and slips several coins into his other hand.\n\n\u201cHere you go, little lady,\u201d he says, dropping the stack into her open palm. \u201cThat\u2019s fifty-seven cents. You\u2019d better count it to make sure it\u2019s all there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d she says, poking the coins deep into her pocket.\n\n\u201cBy the way, when\u2019s the last time you ate something? I\u2019ve made up a few too many sandwiches in the back and it looks like you two might be just the ones to help me get rid of \u2018em. Whaddaya say?\u201d\n\nYou grin from ear to ear and nod vigorously.\n\nJane\u2019s face turns red as she looks off to the side and squeaks \u201cThank you, Mr. Freddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get at \u2018em then,\u201d he says, flashing his eyes at the two of you while clicking the drawer closed on the register.\n\nOn the way to the back, he grabs three small cartons of milk from their refrigerated case without breaking his stride\u2014with you right on his heels. Jane is a reluctant half-step behind.\n\nWhen you reach the meat counter, he steps behind it and pulls up a white butcher paper package from underneath. He opens it revealing three ham and cheese sandwiches stacked high with lettuce, tomato and pickles and proceeds to cut them corner to corner, then fans them out on the paper sheet.\n\n\u201cDig in,\u201d he says, opening the milk cartons and handing you each one, \u201cThere\u2019s more\u2019n plenty to go around.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re eating, he bugs his eyes out at you and makes goofy looking faces. You can\u2019t help but laugh at his antics and Jane spews milk from her nose once.\n\nMr. Freddy has picked up a broom and is sweeping up behind the meat counter by the time the two of you have had your fill. He seems particularly interested in the dark corner beneath the bench that holds his slicer, grinder and saw.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Freddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome,\u201d he tells you both without looking up or turning around as you\u2019re heading toward the front of the store a step behind Jane.\n\nWhen you get to the register, Jane pulls the Moon Pie out of her shirt and puts it back in the rack without looking back. You couldn\u2019t be more pleased. You look back toward Mr. Freddy, but he\u2019s still bent over behind the meat counter and doesn\u2019t see.\n\nOnce outside, Jane fishes out a quarter, drops it in the slot, and pulls out another root beer. You are too full to even think about drinking any of it and, on the way back to your house, take only tiny sips before passing it back to her.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re sitting in the shade of the garage on the opposite side as the house, staring vacantly at the overgrown lot crowding in on the neatly trimmed edge of Honey\u2019s yard.\n\n\u201cYou wanna come with me and Gramma to see the Grand Canyon when I grow up?\u201d asks Jane out of the blue, hugging her knees to her chin.\n\n\u201cUh huh. Okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can take Gramma\u2019s truck and drive the whole way there. She said I can have it when I grow up \u2018cause she\u2019ll be too old to drive it by then. I know how to drive it, she lets me drive it on the farm road when I\u2019m at her house. She has to push the pedals for me, though, \u2018cause I can\u2019t reach \u2018em. I\u2019ll teach you how and then we can take turns. She\u2019s got a big camper on the back for sleepin\u2019 in, but we always sleep in the house on the big bed \u2018cause she\u2019s got tired ol\u2019 bones and she needs her rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make up a map of all the different places,\u201d you say, excitedly, \u201cAnd we can stop at bus stations to find even more. The one we stopped at had posters from all kinds of places. I want to go see them places too.\u201d\n\nJane looks over at you and smiles.\n\nFor the next little bit, the two of you talk about the various places that you know about. The whole idea of adventure really appeals to you and you\u2019re probably even more excited than she is about it. Every time you look over at her, she\u2019s staring back at you through glassy eyes that say more than words ever could.\n\n\n\nJane notices Honey\u2019s car pulling into the driveway before you do. She leaps to her feet and says, \u201cI better go so you don\u2019t get in trouble.

You duck back and peek around to see two scraggly looking men get out.\n\nHoney walks over to one of them. He throws his arm around her waist and pulls her to him. The other walks up beside your mom and leans back against the trunk of the car next to her.\n\nYou stay hidden until they\u2019ve all gone inside and then you go sit on the swings and watch them through the kitchen window. They are laughing and you see them drinking beers and passing a cigarette back and forth.

Momma never comes home on the weekend and it\u2019s always boring with nothing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou follow Jane up the front steps of her house and stop at the wide open door. Every time before now it has been closed.\n\nYou hear a woman cough from the blackness within and see a tiny orange ball of light swing in an arc and bounce off of something, exploding in a shower of sparks. \u201cShit!\u201d the voice says, and then a lamp flips on and you see a ragged, dark haired lady wearing a thin white cotton dress that\u2019s twisted halfway around her middle sitting spraddle-legged in the recliner in the far corner.\n\nJane opens the screen door and takes a small step inside.\n\nA drunken slur whips out like a pistol shot, \u201cWhy are you so late?!\u201d It\u2019s obvious by the tone that she doesn\u2019t care about an answer.\n\n\u201cI was playing at the park with my new friend\u2014\u201d\n\nA flat pint bottle whistles past your heads and shatters on the porch column. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit! I\u2019ve had it with you! If you get the cops out here again, you\u2019ll regret it!\u201d she spits venomously.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do\u2014\u201d Jane starts apologetically as the woman springs from her chair like a cat, snatching her by the arm and starts waling on her in a flurry of slaps.\n\n\u201cStop! Stop! Stop!\u201d you scream, hitting the woman at the waist and grappling with all your strength, trying to force them apart.\n\nShe flicks you away like an insect, but loosens her grasp just long enough for Jane to slip free.\n\nScreaming in half terror, half frustration, Jane flies out the door and into the dark street.\n\nYou dodge around the crazy lady who doesn\u2019t give you a second glance as she steps out onto the porch in pursuit of Jane. She stops at the edge, clutching the column to keep from falling on her face, and screams \u201cYou better run you little bitch!\u201d\n\nYou run out into the dark street in the direction you think Jane went and have gone more than a block when you decide she must\u2019ve gone a different way.\n\nNow you\u2019ve done it. You can feel someone or some thing watching you and you\u2019re pretty sure it isn\u2019t Jane. You\u2019re about to turn around when you hear sobbing up ahead.\n\nTo your relief, you find her crumpled in the grass between the sidewalk and the street. She\u2019s pounding her fists and half squealing, half moaning in her rage.\n\nYou crouch beside her, putting your hand on her shoulder and she looks up at you through swollen, tear-filled eyes.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d you ask.\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something, but can\u2019t seem to form the words so she ends up just nodding.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon. You can stay at my house tonight. I\u2019ll tell Mom what happened when she gets home in the morning. It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d you say, helping her to her feet.\n\nJane shakes her head and says between hitches \u201cNot there. With her. She might come back early.\u201d\n\nYou walk with your arm around her for a few minutes, half carrying her as she regains herself and somehow end up in a dark alley. You hold on to her a bit more tightly than before. Her warmth and presence is enough that you feel safe.\n\nAbout halfway down the alley, Jane grabs your hand and pulls you through a leaning gate\u2014held up somewhat by its bottom hinge which is only still barely attached\u2014toward an eerie and desolate looking, boarded up house.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d she says, \u201cI know the way in.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-wait. What if something\u2019s in there? What if someone catches us?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one ever comes here. This place is \u2018bandoned.\u201d\n\nThere are strange dark shapes crouched in the high, unkempt grass that you really hope are only bushes. You look up at the attic vent and can feel eyes peering back at you from the pitch black gaps between the louvers.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Jane says, stopping cold and pivots you around on legs that desire to keep moving. She swings a section of plywood to the side exposing a window. \u201cGo on in. I\u2019ll hold it open for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d you say looking over your shoulder toward the front of the house.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 to be afraid of,\u201d she says, hiking a foot up on the windowsill and slithers her way through.\n\nAfter another cautious survey, you grip the windowsill on either side and hoist yourself up and through into a darkened and vacant dining room. Overhead hangs a chandelier\u2014the only thing in the whole room.\n\n\u201cSee? Told ya,\u201d she says, throwing her arms wide in presentation, \u201cThere\u2019s not even any furniture.\u201d\n\nYou creep softly past her to the door to the front room and look from side to side. Light filters in through cracks in the boarded up front windows from the street-lamps somewhere outside.\n\nJane plops down with her back against the wall. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stay here tonight. I sure ain\u2019t goin\u2019 home.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome home with me,\u201d you try again, sliding down beside her, \u201cEverything will be better tomorrow. I\u2019ll make a pallet on the floor and you can sleep on my cot.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d she says, shaking her head, \u201cI don\u2019t like your mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t do anything to you. She only gets mad at me sometimes\u2014not all the time. She never does anything to anyone else.\u201d\n\nJane shakes her head and you can tell by the look on her face that she means it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just stay here with you then,\u201d you say.\n\nJane frowns at you. \u201cYou\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. You\u2019re my friend and I won\u2019t leave you here all by yourself.\u201d\n\nJane smiles and clutches your hand in hers, folding her fingers around yours and scoots tight up against you. She lays her head on your shoulder and lets out a long, slow sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re my friend,\u201d Jane says wistfully as she drifts off to sleep.\n\nYou softly lean your head against hers as her breaths deepen and slow.", "action_results": [{"action": "No Haven", "result": "You\u2019ve only just drifted off when a booming man\u2019s voice jars you awake and you very nearly leap out of your skin. \u201cWhat are you doing in there? Come out of there, you two,\u201d he commands, piercing your eyes with his flashlight beam.\n\nYou stagger to your feet and help a groggy Jane to hers. You saunter over to the window and help steady Jane as she picks her way through.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you again. You shouldn\u2019t be in there. This place is falling apart and you could get hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were just exploring,\u201d pleads Jane, \u201cweren\u2019t hurting anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooked like you were sleeping to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just took a little nap is all \u2018cause we got tired.\u201d\n\nThe man grabs you by the arm to steady you as you hop down to the ground. He\u2019s wearing a dark uniform and you see a shiny tin shield pinned to his left breast pocket.\n\n\u201cHow many times have I told you to stay out of places like this, young lady? Maybe I should take you to the station and let you sit in a cell overnight to let you think about it. Maybe then you\u2019ll listen when an adult tells you not to do something.\u201d Turning toward you, he says \u201cI don\u2019t believe I know you, do I?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no, sir. I-I just moved here,\u201d you say, trembling.\n\n\u201cWell, let me tell you that we take a mighty dim view on breaking and entering and trespassing around here. You look old enough to me to know that if something doesn\u2019t belong to you you should just leave it alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yes s-sir.\u201d Your eyes begin to well up. You\u2019ve never met a police officer before and now he\u2019s about to arrest you and throw you in jail.\n\nJane stands there, rigid and glaring. She seems so strong and defiant\u2014something you could never hope to be\u2014looking as if she could attack at any moment.\n\nAfter a couple minutes that seem more like hours, he says \u201cNow you two get on home right now and don\u2019t let me catch you around here again or I will take you in. You understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yes sir,\u201d you say, backpedaling before he can change his mind. You take a couple of steps backward, but Jane only stands there, boring holes in the officer. You snatch her by the hand and drag her along with you. Her gaze remains fixed on him until he\u2019s completely out of sight.\n\n\u201cWhat were you trying to do, get arrested?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t scare me none,\u201d Jane fumes.\n\n\n\nYou take your sweet time, wandering along first in the direction of your house one minute and then Jane\u2019s the next not really wishing to end up at either place.\n\nSomehow you reach the railroad tracks on the edge of town and the two of you absently turn and follow them.\n\nYou look warily over the dark embankment not knowing what may be lying in wait in the undergrowth just waiting to pounce. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to hear it the way the gravel is crunching beneath your feet.\n\nYou take a half-step closer to Jane. Even though it doesn\u2019t help all that much since she\u2019s not as big as you you somehow feel that there\u2019s safety in numbers.\n\nYou reach the edge of town and the wide spot that passes as a railroad staging yard. The street lights are behind you and everything here seems somehow darker even though your eyes have adjusted more to the lack of light.\n\nThere\u2019s a short string of boxcars on the side track and the shadows under and between them are completely black. If there was someone or something hiding in them, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it until it was too late. Jane doesn\u2019t appear to be bothered by this even one little bit.\n\nWhile you\u2019re busy keeping an eye out for movement, Jane steps up to the side of the second boxcar where its door is open a couple of feet\u2014jumps up, pokes her head in and cranes her neck from side to side trying to glimpse what might be inside. You step beside her and shield your eyes with your hands from errant light and can\u2019t make out anything but more blackness.\n\n\u201cBoost me up,\u201d she says, lifting her leg and holding her foot out to you.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a fraidy cat. There\u2019s no one around.\u201d\n\nYou grab her foot with both hands and hoist her up. She\u2019s as light as a feather.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nAfter double-checking to make sure there\u2019s nothing that will grab you from underneath the car, you plant your hands on the floor and jump up, but it\u2019s still a little too high to throw your leg over. You try again jumping with all you have and still no dice. On the third attempt, Jane grabs you under the arm and heaves just enough that you manage to hang your foot. You can feel yourself sliding back out and under the car, but she snatches you behind the neck and you strain against her hands gaining just enough leverage to make it up.\n\nThe two of you shuffle your way toward the end of the car where you find a few scattered and crushed cardboard barrels. You step around them and make your way toward the corner where you hear Jane slide down the side wall on the same side as the door and you turn and seat yourself against the end so that you are facing the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen Momma drinks she gets mean. She\u2019s not always like that. Mostly she acts like I\u2019m not even there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s starting to get like that. She spends all her time over at Honey\u2019s house and now she\u2019s got a new boyfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mom will never be as bad as mine. She doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, but things keep getting worse instead of better.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too dark to see Jane\u2019s face, but you can tell she\u2019s staring at you. It makes you a little uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should just leave and go somewhere,\u201d Jane finally says, \u201cMaybe we could live at Gramma\u2019s house. She\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nYou lean your head back and think about what it would be like without your mom. You\u2019ve never been away from her for long. It\u2019s a little scary, but also a little exciting. You\u2019d get to be with Jane. That\u2019s also exciting and scary at the same time, too.\n\nWhile you ponder all of this, you drift off to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Unexpected Journey", "result": "You are jostled awake, but the rhythmic clacking and gentle, soothing rocking makes it difficult to keep your eyes open. Slowly, you begin to drift back toward dreamland when you come to a sudden and horrific realization and your eyes pop wide open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving!\u201d\n\nJane moans softly in her sleep.\n\nGoose-pimples peak the length of your arm and the tiny hairs on the back of your neck come to attention. You reach out toward her sleep sounds and your hand finds Jane\u2019s cheek with more force than you\u2019d intended.\n\nShe bolts upright, swinging and lands a hard slap to the side of your head.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving,\u201d you repeat, cradling your ear, \u201cThe train\u2019s moving!\u201d\n\nShe jumps up and the two of you stumble over the debris as you dash for the partly open door. Outside, the ground whizzes by at breakneck speed. You can barely even make it out as it passes by in the darkness. There is no way you\u2019d be able to jump out at this speed\u2014especially when you can\u2019t see where you might land.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck here,\u201d says Jane, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait \u2018til we stop to get off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow will we find our way back?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just follow the train tracks. They go straight back to town.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d you say, staring blankly toward the horizon\u2014seeing the land zip by faster and faster in your imagination as it rapidly approaches a blur.\n\nYou return to the front of the car and sit back down next to Jane.\n\nWith each passing clack, you know that you are getting farther from home and deeper in dutch with your mom. There\u2019s no telling what she\u2019ll do to you this time when you get back.\n\n\u201cMy mom is going to be really mad when she finds out I\u2019m not in the garage,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cWe should just keep going and find somebody nice to live with. Gramma doesn\u2019t have a phone, but maybe we might could find her house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. What if she doesn\u2019t like me? What if we can\u2019t find someone who likes both of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll keep looking \u2018til we do.\u201d\n\nYou lay your head down next to Jane and think about what she said. You\u2019ve never been away from your mom before. What if everyone turns out to be just like her?\n\nYou can feel the vibrations through the wood in your teeth. It feels really weird.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou wake up and the car is still once more. Maybe it was just a dream.\n\nYou reach out your hand in the darkness, find Jane\u2019s shoulder and gently shake her awake.\n\n\u201cAre we stopped?\u201d she groggily asks.\n\n\u201cYeah. We should probably get off the train in case it starts moving again.\u201d\n\nYou stand up and help Jane stagger to her feet.\n\nLooking out the door, you see the street-lamps on the wrong side of the track. The diesel engine drones idly in the distance and you can see a rhythmic flashing light coming from that direction, but it\u2019s too far away to make out more than that.\n\nYou hop down onto the crunching gravel and quickly make your way into a stand of trees that are silhouetted against the predawn sky. You sit there until the train resumes its journey and see the sun peek out above the horizon.\n\nWhen you\u2019re sure that the coast is clear, you make your way in the opposite direction that the train was headed. A short distance down the tracks you find a similar looking yard to the one you\u2019d left last night.\n\nA line of metal buildings that serve the railroad runs along the street of whatever town you\u2019re in now and the two of you rattle doorknobs in hopes that you\u2019ll find one unlocked. They are all locked up tight.\n\nYou resume your trek.\n\nA few blocks down, you come to a crossing and see a highway sign a short distance away. You see the numbers 281 printed in big block letters inside of a white shield. If only you had your map with you, you might be able to figure out where you are and how far away you are from your home.\n\nThe sun is at your back and your shadows stretch into nothingness ahead of you.\n\nJane carefully steps on every cross tie as she walks along while you step on every other one with your other foot on the rail\u2014matching her stride for stride\u2014which makes you appear to have a bad and pronounced limp. Your foot slips every now and again on the rail\u2019s dew covered surface.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Momma\u2019s boyfriends. Sometimes they\u2019re mean to her and sometimes they\u2019re mean to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Mom has boyfriends?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, lots of \u2018em. Every time she goes out and gets drunk, she gets another one. Sometimes it\u2019s the same one, but not always.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does she have so many?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to. Kids cost a lot and it\u2019s the only way she can make money. Each one only gives her a little money and sometimes they give her stuff when they don\u2019t have any money. I wish she could find a job like your mom has. Nobody wants to give her a job, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do they give her money if they are mean to her?\u201d\n\nJane shrugs. \u201cBecause she needs it, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they mean to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody likes a bastard. It\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a bastard?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody that doesn\u2019t have a dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a dad anymore, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you had one so you\u2019re not a bastard.

You snatch her by the hand as she stumbles to her feet and the two of you race off deeper into the woods.\n\nAfter a few minutes, you both stop\u2014bent over to catch your breath\u2014and hear no sign of the scruffy old man in pursuit.\n\n\n\nYou head back in the direction you think the tracks are in, but at an angle and\u2014after trudging through the underbrush for quite some time\u2014discover that you are in fact hopelessly lost.\n\nMosquitoes swarm all around you and it\u2019s impossible to wave them off. Your hair drips with sweat and trickles the fine dust that covers your face into your eyes causing them to swell and burn. Your arms and legs are covered in swollen bumps from hundreds of itchy bites and the underbrush you\u2019ve been plowing your way through has left tiny cuts and scrapes everywhere your skin is exposed.

You look up to find menacing looking clouds fringed on the edges with lightning. You quicken your pace and just then the heavens decide to open up. The wind nearly knocks you off your feet and the rain scours your skin.\n\nSoaked to the skin and shaking like a leaf, you step out into a clearing where way out in the middle of it, you spy a quonset-style barn that\u2019s open at the ends. The two of you drag yourselves over to it with lightning striking all around, accompanied by instant and deafening thunderclaps. You feel extremely vulnerable out in the open like this, but you have to get out of this sweeping rain.\n\nInside you find that it\u2019s stacked high on both sides with bales of bright green hay. You squeeze your way between the front wall and the stack and find that there is a short and narrow crawlspace behind that runs the length of the building. The bales are stacked at a slight angle which makes a narrow shelf at the top of each layer.\n\nStill dripping and now covered with dried grass, the two of you wring your clothes out as best you can and spread them out on the shelf of hay to dry and you sit huddled and shivering in the near darkness.\n\nYou notice how frail Jane looks. Her ribs are prominent and she looks somehow more drawn than you had ever seen her. She looks like a skeleton. You feel rage welling up inside you at the abuse she\u2019s suffered at her mother\u2019s hand. How could anyone be that evil?\n\nJane still looks worried. The narrow escape was still obviously weighing on her. When she looks over at you you smile and she smiles back.\n\nThough you don\u2019t see it, you know that the sun has set due to the complete darkness outside. The wind has subsided, but the rain is still coming down in a deluge.\n\nExhaustion takes hold and you pass yawns back and forth. You rake hay into a rough pile and make yourself as comfortable as you can. Clutching each other for warmth, you try to force sleep in spite of your misery. And eventually you do.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re jolted awake to the sound of a revving engine just outside the barn. You jump up and jerk on your damp clothes as quickly as you possibly can and stealthily make your way to the opposite end of the barn.\n\nWhen you are sure that the coast is clear, you bolt\u2014only to crash into a big man in faded overalls who latches onto you more out of surprise or instinct than anything else.\n\n\u201cHold on there, kids\u201d, his voice bubbles, \u201cwhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Jane demands.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you two doing in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d, you sheepishly respond.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you from? What\u2019s your name? Where\u2019re your folks?\u201d\n\nRealizing the futility of it, you both stop squirming and he eases his grip on your arms. You share a momentary glance with Jane and in that very instant, know that neither of you are about to tell this stranger anything.\n\nAfter a couple odd minutes of silence, the farmer decides that he won\u2019t press you, but he sure isn\u2019t about to let a couple of young kids just run loose when he doesn\u2019t know who or where you belong. He steers you over to his idling tractor and makes you climb up\u2014one on either side\u2014beside his seat, then climbs up behind you. He shoves the tractor into gear and makes a beeline over the hill to his house.\n\n\u201cMartha! I caught a couple of rats in the barn!\u201d bellows the farmer from behind you as he ushers you through the door of the small farmhouse.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Earl?\u201d asks a stocky, gray-haired woman entering the room from the far door. \u201cLan\u2019 sakes! Where did these children come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you. I found \u2018em sneakin\u2019 \u2018round the barn. They\u2019re pretty scraped up, too. Could use some of your doctorin\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou children get caught out in the storm last night?\u201d\n\nYou both slowly nod.\n\n\u201dLet\u2019s have a look and see if we can\u2019t get you cleaned up.\u201d\n\nYou look at each other and then move slowly in her direction.\n\n\u201cCome now,\u201d she says, putting an arm around each of your shoulders, \u201cWhy! You\u2019re still soaked! Earl, go get a couple of your shirts so the little ones can get out of these wet clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, dear,\u201d he says, turning and quickly walking down a hallway.\n\n\u201cNow come this way. You can change in the other room.\u201d She ushers the two of you into the short, dark hallway that Earl just went down. By the time you reach the second door, Earl is coming out of the one in the very back.\n\n\u201cHere ya go,\u201d he says holding a shirt out to each of you.\n\n\u201cNow you go in here and I\u2019ll be right in to collect your clothes, sweetie. Jus\u2019 let me get the ointment and we\u2019ll take care of those nasty scratches while we\u2019re at it,\u201d she says to Jane.\n\n\u201cAnd you go with Earl and he\u2019ll bring me your clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, little man,\u201d he says, scooping you toward the back room as he turns.\n\nWhile you\u2019re getting out of your wet clothes, Martha taps on the bedroom door and hands a tube of salve, a washcloth and a white ceramic basin of water to Earl when he opens it.\n\n\u201cHave you seen how emaciated these children are?\u201d she tries to whisper low enough to Earl so that you don\u2019t hear. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had more than scraps for weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAyuh. They\u2019re pretty scrawny alright,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cThey must\u2019ve been through quite the ordeal.\u201d\n\nWhen he gets back to you, he gives you a quick rub down with a wet cloth and then smears salve all over your abrasions. It really stings due to his large hands being so rough and calloused, but the ointment itself is cool and soothing.\n\nWith the sleeves being much too long for your arms, you have trouble buttoning up the shirt and Earl ends up having to take over for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Departure", "result": "Jane looks ridiculous in Earl\u2019s gigantic shirt. It drags the ground around her feet as she plods back down the hall in front of you\u2014doing her utmost not to trip on it. Of course, you must look equally funny since the one you\u2019re wearing is nearly trailing the floor on you and the cuffs dangle nearly a foot below your hands.\n\n\u201cI bet you two are starving,\u201d Martha says in a chipper tone, \u201cCome on in the kitchen and you can eat some breakfast with us. It\u2019s almost ready. All I gotta do is set out two more places.\u201d\n\nWhen you step through the door, you can\u2019t believe your eyes. You\u2019ve never seen so much food on a table at one time. There are biscuits, eggs, both bacon and sausage, fried potatoes and gravy, and most of a left over ham in which a few slices have already been cut. There\u2019s a big block of butter and a loaf of light bread. Arranged next to each plate, is a bowl of oatmeal, a short glass of orange juice and a heavy round glass with a foot and stem full to the top with fresh milk.\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine how any more could even fit on the table without things tumbling off on the floor, but Martha does just that when she sets a place for you and Jane. And the table doesn\u2019t look any more heaped than it did already.\n\nThe four of you sit down and before you dig in, the elderly couple takes hold of each of your hands and bows their heads.\n\n\"Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty,\u201d says Earl with his eyes closed, and squeezing your hand he adds, \u201cAnd thank you for bringing us these dear little ones that they may share in our feast. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.\"\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d parrots Martha as she reaches out and starts heaping food on your and Jane\u2019s plates before she even does her own.\n\nEverything is so, so delicious and you cram in more than you ever have in your entire life. Jane is stuffing food in and matching you bite for bite. Earl and Martha pick at theirs and appear to be enjoying watching the two of you eat.\n\nWhen you finally push back from your plate it looks as if it has barely even been touched, but your belly feels like an overripe melon. There\u2019s no way you could possibly poke in another spoonful.\n\nYour eyes have a mind of their own and you watch as the dinner table quickly disappears. You start to slump forward and are prevented doing a face-plant into your plate by Earl\u2019s massive hand. As everything goes black, you hear him chuckle and say \u201cI guess this little guy\u2019s had plenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo has this one,\u201d laughs Martha.\n\n\n\nYou are startled awake by a loud rapping on a door. You find yourself half-sunken into a big fluffy bed and Jane has an arm and a leg draped over you. Her warmth is so comforting and you don\u2019t want to move out of this very spot. The shades are drawn and let in only a pinstripe of blinding light making everything else in the room too dark to make out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sleepin\u2019 in the back room,\u201d you hear Martha say, \u201cPoor little dears were starving and plumb tuckered out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know who they belong to?\u201d asks a strange man\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t say. I s\u2019pose they\u2019ve run off and I can\u2019t blame \u2018em. They\u2019re jus\u2019 skin \u2018n bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nThe door cracks open and spills light into your eyes.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake,\u201d Martha says quietly, flicking on the light. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here that wants to talk to you. Let me get you your clothes so you can get dressed. They\u2019re all clean and dry now.\u201d\n\nAfter Martha has closed the door, you shake Jane awake. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here to talk to us,\u201d you tell her.\n\n\u201cWho is it? What do you think they want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\nMartha comes back in and lays your clothes out on the foot of the bed. \u201cHurry and get dressed and you all come on out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jane repeats to Martha, but she closes the door without answering.\n\nYou both heave yourselves over and roll off opposite sides of the bed and drag your clothes on, leaving Earl\u2019s crumpled shirts behind.\n\n\n\nYou follow Jane down the hall and she freezes as she steps into the front room. You lean forward, peering around her and see a policeman framed in the outside doorway. He\u2019s wearing a brown and khaki uniform and has a star pinned above his breast pocket.\n\n\u201cStep in here so I can get a better look at you,\u201d says the deputy.\n\nYou both take tentative steps into the room\u2014being careful to keep your distance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen either of you before. Where are you kids from?\u201d\n\nYou look at Jane and her face is like stone. The policeman would probably take Jane back to her house so her mom could hit on her some more. It might be for the best if you stay silent and not tell him anything.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, the deputy takes you each by the arm and says \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll have to do this the hard way then. Come on and let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou and Jane are ushered along and both of you walk stiff-legged out to his car.\n\n\u201cYou kids take care of yourselves,\u201d calls Martha from the porch as the car door is being closed behind you. You look over and see her and Earl waving to you, but you don\u2019t feel at all like waving back.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been sitting on hard wooden chairs in the station for quite some time. Beyond the little glass window to the next room, you see several people moving around and you hear the occasional crackle of static mixed with garbled speech every now and then.\n\n\u201cWe should run away,\u201d whispers Jane without turning to you, \u201cbefore they can take us back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll just catch us,\u201d you whisper back, \u201cWe don\u2019t even know where we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go back home now. I have to find Gramma.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should tell them where she lives so they\u2019ll take us there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t. They\u2019ll only take us home.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you tell \u2018em how mean your mom is to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care none about that. They always take me back home.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Run away", "result": "\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d you say.\n\nYou wait until the dispatcher\u2019s head is turned and both of you bolt for the door. You don\u2019t hear any ruckus coming from behind you so you figure you made it. You don\u2019t have a clue where you are or where to go, but you run.\n\nThere are quite a few more people on the streets here than back at home. You try to keep out of sight at first, but there\u2019s just too many and not enough places to hide. If you knew the town it\u2019d probably make things much easier. Eventually, you don\u2019t even bother trying to conceal yourselves. Why bother? It\u2019s not like anyone is paying you any mind, anyway.\n\nAfter several blocks, you spot another one of those highway signs with 281 printed on it\u2014only this one is smaller and way up high on a lamp post and has an arrow. Maybe you could find the train tracks again if you follow the little arrow.\n\n\u201cI think the tracks are down that way,\u201d you tell Jane.\n\nShe gives you a puzzled look.\n\n\u201cSee the sign? I saw one like that, only bigger, when we were at that train yard.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Then that\u2019s where we need to go. No one knows how we got here. They won\u2019t know where to look.\u201d\n\nYou both grin at each other and turn the corner.\n\nAbout a block out of town, you find the highway. You don\u2019t see any sign of the tracks and decide to follow along it at a safe distance away so any passing cars won\u2019t notice you.\n\n\u201cWe should get some food,\u201d says Jane, \u201cwe might have to walk for a long way and we don\u2019t want to starve. There\u2019s a store right over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any money, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need money. I\u2019ll just grab something when no one\u2019s looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Mr. Freddy saw you last time. He just didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Freddy\u2019s my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why would you steal his stuff?\u201d\n\nJane shrugs. \u201c\u2018cause I need it, I guess.\u201d\n\nAgainst your better judgment, you follow Jane over and into the store. While she walks down the aisles picking things off the shelf and acts like she\u2019s looking at the price tags, you pretend to look at the magazines in the rack. You don\u2019t like this at all, but you can\u2019t say anything now. It\u2019s too late for that.\n\nSuddenly, a hand clamps down on your shoulder.\n\n\u201cHere you are. Now where\u2019s your little friend?\u201d\n\nYou look up to see the deputy looking toward the back just as Jane steps around the corner.\n\n\u201cThere you are, little lady. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nShe sheepishly walks over to the two of you.\n\n\u201cYou two are beginning to be quite the handful, you know that? I guess we should\u2019ve put bells around your necks.\u201d\n\nJane glares up at him. You know your goose is cooked. There\u2019s nothing you can do now. It\u2019s all over.\n\n\u201cJust out of curiosity, how\u2019d the two of you manage to get this far from home? I can\u2019t imagine that you walked over eighty miles. Did someone give you a ride?\u201d\n\nJane says nothing. If you tell him you\u2019ll only get into more trouble so the only explanation you give him is a shrug.\n\n\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019ll be someone here shortly to drive you back. And I\u2019m sure there will be a lot of questions for you two.\u201d\n\n\n\nA couple of hours later, you are back to your town. It was a long, quiet ride and neither you nor Jane gave more than a yes or no answer to the man that drove you. You only looked at each other attempting to communicate with only your eyes. All that she\u2014and you, no doubt\u2014could convey was sadness and a sense of hopelessness of the situation.\n\nYou sit slumped\u2014craning your neck to peek through the patrol car\u2019s rear window\u2014and watch as the officer who ran you and Jane out of the abandoned house a couple nights ago turns away from Jane and her mother, and walks back to the car. No sooner than his back is turned does she turn and shove Jane inside the house, slamming the door shut behind her.\n\nThe officer throws a glance over his shoulder, but doesn\u2019t break stride as he continues on his way.\n\nAfter he closes his car door, you say \u201cIs she gonna hit Jane?\u201d\n\nHe turns sideways in his seat and looks back at you. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s not able to sit down for a week after pulling a stunt like this. Do you understand how dangerous it was for the two of you out there all alone? We\u2019re lucky that we found you before something bad happened to you. You don\u2019t know what some people are capable of doing to children.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hates Jane. I don\u2019t want her to hit her anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo mother hates her own child. She\u2019s just having a rough time raising her on her own\u2014being a single mother and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen. I\u2019ll swing back by after I drop you off and look in on her, okay?\u201d He starts the engine and pulls it into gear. \u201cEverything will be back to normal as soon as this mess blows over.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs you pull into the drive, the door opens and your mom steps out on the porch. She rushes over to the patrol car and snatches you by the arm\u2014dragging you out and pulling you close\u2014as soon as the policeman opens the rear door.\n\n\u201cHere he is, safe and sound. No one knows how those two managed to make it so far away on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a handful. I can barely keep up with him most of the time. An\u2019 with this new job, I\u2019ll have to work extra hard at it, I guess,\u201d she says, flashing her eyes at you over a wan smile. \u201cI\u2019m just glad he\u2019s home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, ma\u2019am. Glad to be of service.\u201d\n\nHe walks with you to the door of the garage and watches as the two of you step inside.\n\n\u201cThanks again, Officer,\u201d your mom says, ushering you in and closing the door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome,\u201d he says, turning around and walking back the way he came.\n\nShe lifts the corner of the vinyl curtain to watch him get into his patrol car and pull out of the driveway. When she turns around to you, her face is a deep shade of red and skewed beyond all recognition.\n\n\u201cIf things are so bad here that you felt the need to run away, then why didn\u2019t you just stay gone!?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have an answer. You take a step to the rear as she lifts the solid metal rod from the window and yanks it free of the curtain.\n\nShe is on you before you even know it\u2014whipping you side to side like a terrier does a rat by a handful of hair in one hand while she whacks at your butt and the back of your legs with the curtain rod in the other. Every so often, an errant strike lands in the small of your back and your vision momentarily goes black. You can feel it cut deep and glance off bone with each blow.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you do anything right? Why do you always have to go out of your way to make me mad?\u201d\n\nYou try to lessen the blows by deflecting them with your palms, but it only forces her to swing harder. The flesh on the underside of your hands soon feels tight and swollen, and you no longer have control enough to maneuver them into a position of any benefit at all.\n\nAll you can do is grit your teeth and bear the pain. If you make even the slightest sound of whimpering, she\u2019ll \u201cgive you something to really cry about\u201d.\n\nThe stinging pain finally lessens as your vision fades and grows more and more distant as the world goes dark around you.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been lying here in the darkness. Your whole body throbs from one end to the other and you want nothing more than to return to sleep.\n\nWhat about Jane? She was right. You and she need to just run away together and find her Gramma or else somebody nice to take care of the two of you. You don\u2019t have a choice anymore. You know that now. Your mom will end up killing you if you don\u2019t get away.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes. You drag your arms under you and shove yourself to your knees.\n\nYou see no sign of your mom and can only guess that she has gone back to the party in Honey\u2019s house.\n\nYou pick yourself up off the floor. You can\u2019t straighten your legs and your back is in an uncontrollable hunch, but you manage to maintain your balance and not topple over despite the impossible angle you are leaning.\n\nOne determined step after another, you make your way to the door.\n\nThe curtain is now back in its place over the window. You look at it for what seems like a long time debating whether or not to do something about that impromptu weapon. It would do absolutely no good, though, because she\u2019d just grab something else to use on you the next time.\n\nYou reach out and grip the knob with all the strength you can muster. It doesn\u2019t give easily, but you manage to turn it enough that the latch lets go. You hobble on one foot through the open doorway into the bright afternoon sun and pull the door closed behind you.\n\nYou can hear music coming from Honey\u2019s house, but don\u2019t see any movement through the windows. You limp around the garage and through the back yard to the alley.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about mid-afternoon by the time you reach Jane\u2019s house. The place looks locked up tight.

You shuffle to it as fast as your legs will allow.\n\nThe house just looks like any other house in the daytime.

You can hear his clapping footfalls and after a moment of silence you hear him speaking, but his words garble and run together as you drift off to sleep.\n\n\n\n\u201cAaahhh!\u201d You jolt awake when a searing pain arcs through your back. You whirl around and see several people standing around you\u2014an older couple that you guess are only customers talking with Mr. Freddy and a couple of firemen.\n\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d says a fireman wearing latex gloves and scrutinizing your wounds, \u201cI guess it is as bad as it looks. I\u2019ll try to be more careful.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026first the little girl and now this,\u201d says the woman, \u201cWhat is this world coming to?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was his friend,\u201d says Mr. Freddy under his breath, \u201cNever saw one without the other since he got into town. They\u2019ve been like two peas in a pod.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d says the woman, \u201cwhat a cryin\u2019 shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody should do something about it,\u201d says the old man.\n\n\u201cI intend to,\u201d says Mr. Freddy, \u201cjust as soon as Jarvis gets back. Joan said he was looking into a trespass out at the ol\u2019 Simon farm and she\u2019d send him over the minute he got in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung people these days have no business having children,\u201d says the old man.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any permanent damage,\u201d says the fireman who\u2019s been working on you, \u201clet\u2019s get you over to the station and we\u2019ll get you all cleaned and bandaged up. What d\u2019ya say?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re staring at the old woman puzzling over what she\u2019d said and finally can\u2019t help but interrupt \u201cWhat little girl? What do you mean?\u201d\n\nMr. Freddy\u2019s head snaps around and he locks eyes with you, working his jaw without making any sound.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d gasps the old woman behind her hand, \u201cMe and my big mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I guess not. All this must\u2019ve happened around the same time,\u201d Mr. Freddy finally manages to say.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Jane?\u201d\n\nFocusing back on you he begins to stammer \u201cI\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, son. She\u2014 she was\u2014\u201d before turning away and stalking off toward the back of the store.\n\nThe hairs on the back of your neck and arms prickle. \u201cWhat happened to Jane?!\u201d you shriek at the other dumbstruck faces.", "action_results": [{"action": "In Hiding", "result": "Everything is kind of a blur. You remember being led to the firehouse and worked on in the back of the ambulance. You remember how everyone was busy coming and going around you and there were new faces popping up every now and again, but you can\u2019t recall everything that went on there. You don\u2019t even know how you got here.\n\nYou must\u2019ve run when no one was looking because they never would\u2019ve let you out of their sight in the condition you were in or the danger you could face if your mom had gotten her hands on you again.\n\nYou are laying face down on Jane\u2019s bag of covers in her \u201csecret place\u201d. You can feel the cool dampness all around you and it is so soothing. There is something \u201csafe\u201d about this place. You understand now why Jane would hide and sometimes even sleep overnight in here.\n\nWith every stretch and adjustment you make, the bandages on your back and legs relax and constrict. This, too, is both soothing and comforting.\n\nYour eyes have long since adjusted to the dim light filtering in through the grate\u2014which you must\u2019ve closed behind you when you crawled in, but you can\u2019t remember doing that, either. It\u2019s got too much of a greenish tint to it to be sunlight. It must be coming from the street lamp on the corner.\n\nYou look over toward the dark corner of the concrete foundation and see a couple empty pop bottles propped up against the change jar which still has your dollar resting on top of all the different coins. You remember sharing those root beers with Jane. Next to them is the \u2018treasure chest\u2019 all tied up neatly in the ribbon just the way Jane had left it.\n\nYour stomach is growling and twisting in knots. You haven\u2019t eaten anything since the feast you shared with Jane, Earl and Martha early this morning.\n\nYou can\u2019t risk going back the garage for food and if you went to the store, Mr. Freddy would likely call the cops for your own protection. You don\u2019t know what else you can do other than just tough out the hunger like you\u2019ve done so many times before.\n\nYou close your eyes and try to sleep, but the gnawing and churning won\u2019t allow you to drift off. You\u2019ll have to suffer through it or else find some way of taking the edge off.\n\n\n\nYou crawl over to the grate and see that outside it is full dark. You shove lightly on the grate and it groans loudly against the concrete foundation. You nearly jump clean out of your skin. When you finally catch your breath again, you lift up on it on the side and slide it over sideways.\n\nThe high grass outside is dimly lit and shadowy things move about just outside your vision. Your hands and feet go numb, and you get that all too familiar coppery taste in your mouth.\n\nYou crawl out and drag the grate back over the hole, keeping your eyes on the deeper shadows all around you.\n\nOne step after another, you make your way to the corner of the house and\u2014instead of going around the front to the steps\u2014climb up the side and slink your way past the window to the door.\n\nYou gently swing open the screen door\u2014propping it with your foot\u2014and heave up on the doorknob like you remember seeing Jane do, then push inward with all your strength. The door plows the carpeting with a ripping sound that makes a whole new battalion of tiny hairs rise to attention on the back of your neck. Inside, you see that it is darker than dark.\n\nWhen the pounding in your ears subsides, you take a short step through the door and strain your ears against the silence. The only sound you hear is that of your own heavy breath going in and out.\n\nLooking over your shoulder only makes the panic grow, so you focus on finding the door in the back wall. You tiptoe through the room with your hands out in front of you and hoping that whatever is lurking in here doesn\u2019t grab you by the arm or ankle from the dark.\n\nYou find the door facing and pull yourself around it, putting your back against the wall and slamming your eyes shut. Your tongue has swollen two sizes and scrapes leathery against the roof of your mouth.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and can see the kitchen sink from what little light filters in through the window above it and the dim silhouettes of the cabinet doors flanking each side along the far wall. The linoleum floor is brighter than the dark carpeting in the front room and you can just make out that there\u2019s nothing creeping around in here\u2014at least, not in the open.\n\nYou step lightly over to the sink and slowly make your way toward a wooden box on the counter. Taking another look behind you, you reach out and pry open the small doors with your thumbs. You reach inside and feel a soft bread wrapper with only a couple of slices left in it and a tall, square, cardboard box.\n\nYou take both items and turn toward the front door. The frame is much brighter from this side and is the only thing you can see clearly. Each step you take toward it gets longer and longer until you are at full gallop.\n\nOn your way through, you manage to snag the knob and jerk the door closed behind you\u2014trapping whatever it was that was behind you inside.\n\nYou cross the porch\u2014carefully skirting the dark window\u2014and slip back around the side of the house, then crawl back inside to the safety of the \u201csecret place\u201d and drag the grate back into place.\n\nTearing them into chunks, you cram the two stale bread slices into your mouth and choke them down. You then turn your attention to the box. It is still unopened and you rock it lightly in your hands. You can feel the packed contents bounce against the sides. If you\u2019re very careful with them, you can stretch the crackers out for a couple of weeks.\n\nAfter you prop it and the wadded bread wrapper against the wall beside the bottles, you flop face-down on the bag of covers.\n\nYour thoughts turn back to the last few days and of Jane as the world around you fades into dream.\n\n\n\nYou wake up feeling a bit too warm and your mouth is dry and dusty. You are desperate for something to quench your thirst.\n\nAs you push yourself to your knees, your whole body screams out in agony. You\u2019d forgotten all about yesterday, but it all comes flooding back to you now.\n\nYou reach over and pick up the change jar, but it\u2019s mostly pennies and the pops in the vending machine cost a quarter. You can\u2019t risk going there, anyway. You might not be able to get away this time.\n\nAfter putting the jar back, you crawl over to the grate and peer out as far as you can with your face pressed against it. As far as you can see, all there is is tall grass and weeds so you push it out and to the side, and crawl out into the harsh sunlight. Then you carefully drag it back into place.\n\nThere are no houses beyond this street so you decide to crawl to the back of Jane\u2019s house before standing up. There aren\u2019t any close neighbors, but you can see a house a little distance on down the road.\n\nAt the far corner of Jane\u2019s house, you spot prefab concrete steps leading up do a back door. It\u2019s beyond where the kitchen lies and must open into a room you haven\u2019t been in. The house doesn\u2019t seem nearly as spooky in the light of day. You decide to see if you can open it and get inside so you can maybe find something to drink.\n\nThe door barely moves inward and bumps hard against something up high. You can\u2019t see beyond the light pink curtain so you release the knob. Unless you can find an open window, you\u2019ll have to go in through the front.\n\nAll the windows are latched from the inside so after you make certain there is no one in sight, you dash for the porch and shove your way in as quickly as you can\u2014closing the door behind you.\n\nAfter taking a second to let your eyes adjust, you walk across the room to the kitchen which is much brighter that the living room now. You stretch up on your tiptoes to reach the faucet knobs and find that they do still work. You catch handfuls of water and lose most of it bringing them to your mouth, but it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve had enough, you look around for something to catch water in for later. You find a couple of pots on the stove, but they\u2019re filled with moldy food. There are no plastic milk jugs in the garbage that you can rinse out so you start looking around for anything else that will work. The only other thing there is are whiskey bottles with screw on caps so you rinse them out as best you can and\u2014even though you can still smell the alcohol in them\u2014fill up six of the tallest ones.\n\nYou rummage through the cabinets and find a couple of cans of green beans and a can opener. They won\u2019t be as good uncooked, but since you have no choice you\u2019ll just have to eat them straight from the can.\n\nThe refrigerator is bare except for half a stick of butter which might help the crackers slide down easier, but you leave it where it is because it would only end up melting and making a mess.\n\nYou head over to the door in the far back corner that you thought was a closet and find that behind it is a small room with a water heater being the only major thing in it. There is also a broom, a mop, a dustpan and a bucket and other such cleaning tools that you suspect haven\u2019t been used on the place in quite some time. The floor is buckled and crinkles under your feet as you step lightly over to the back door. You see a lock mounted to the top of the back door well out of your reach and it takes some fancy maneuvering of the broom handle to slide the bolt out of the barrel, but the door is now usable so you don\u2019t have to go around to the front and be spotted by random passersby or the neighbors.\n\nYou make sure everything is back to exactly the way you found it before closing the door and carrying the water bottles and other items back around to the \u201csecret place\u201d.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been hiding in here for the last two days when you hear footsteps coming from inside the house above you. Voices drift down to you through the floorboards. You hold your breath and don\u2019t move a muscle in case they can hear you as easily as you can them.\n\n\u201cThis place is a filthy pigsty. How could anyone live in this place? Why was she allowed to even keep a child here?\u201d you hear a woman say.\n\n\u201cNo one knew. They mostly kept to themselves,\u201d says a familiar sounding man\u2019s voice, \u201cYou should hurry and get what you need because I\u2019m not really supposed to let anyone in here until after the trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever going to find something for her to wear in all this mess. And even if I do, it\u2019ll have to be cleaned before the service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s gonna be this Thursday, but have they decided where they\u2019re going to hold it, yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Thursday. It\u2019ll most likely be in the school gymnasium since there are so many people who\u2019ve already called and want to send flowers. Since the story hit all the papers, there\u2019ll probably be a big turnout, too. It\u2019s always sad when someone so young passes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was right in front of my eyes and I couldn\u2019t see it. The boy even warned me when I dropped her off and I thought he was exaggerating, like kids do. I wish I\u2019d have listened. Really listened. I told him I\u2019d look in on her, but by the time I got back it was too late.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s who it is! It\u2019s Officer Jarvis. Now you can put a face to the voice.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. The whole town new what shape the little girl was in and just sat on their hands. We\u2019re all to blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, it\u2019s my job to notice these things. I should\u2019ve done something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all should\u2019ve done something more for her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a few minutes where all you can hear is footsteps above you and then the woman finally says \u201cI can\u2019t find anything in all this mess. We need to just take up a collection to get her something decent\u2014even if I have to buy it all myself.\u201d\n\nA short time later, you hear a car pulling away. You let out a long sigh of relief as you roll over onto your back.\n\nYou spend the rest of the afternoon looking over your map and at Jane\u2019s postcards. Everything you and Jane dreamed about seems so hopeless and so far away now. You only knew her for a few days, but it feels like you knew her your entire life.\n\nSometime long after dark, your grief finally gives way to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Farewell", "result": "You sit on the bleachers at the edge of the school\u2019s soccer field, staring over at the gymnasium. The parking lot is packed tighter than if there were a game going on inside and the cars stretch clear down both sides of the street beyond where you can see. It looks like there might be more people here than even live in this whole town.\n\nThe funeral won\u2019t be for a while yet, but people are paying their respects and viewing her remains. You want so much to see her one last time, but not like that. So you just sit here\u2014feeling more helpless and alone than ever before\u2014and just stare at the building.\n\nYou hadn\u2019t seen the policeman since he\u2019d dropped you off with your mother on that fateful day, but you can make out his face every now and then when he looks out at you from just inside the glass double doors. He\u2019s wearing a dark blue suit now instead of his uniform. When he opens the door and starts walking toward you, every instinct in your body tells you to flee, but you haven\u2019t the will to even stand. You are too tired and sad way down deep to run. You don\u2019t even care what he does to you at this point. You just close your eyes and wait.\n\nYou can hear his heavy footfalls as he approaches and then a hand on your knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. You open your eyes and see through your tears that he has knelt before you and is struggling against his own tears for words. It takes him a couple of minutes, but he finally manages to speak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you and thought something bad might\u2019ve happened. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re alright. I guess you\u2019re here to say goodbye to your friend. We can get you to the station and take care of everything afterward. Would you like to go in?\u201d\n\nYou widen your eyes and your jaw slackens at the very horror of the suggestion. \u201cNo, huh uh,\u201d you manage to weakly get out.\n\n\u201cYou really should, you know. She was your friend and she would want you there,\u201d he coaxes softly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be the last time you\u2019ll ever see her and you really should say goodbye.\u201d\n\nYour eyes start to burn and you can\u2019t hold in your grief any longer. You scream from way down deep and fall forward as all of your strength falls away. He catches you before you hit the ground and scoops you up tight against him.\n\n\u201cI told you. I told you,\u201d you say hoarsely, between sobs.\n\nHe mumbles something, but you can\u2019t make out the words through your hysterical squeaks. You feel his chest heaving as he tries to hold back his own flood of emotions.\n\nEventually, you manage to get hold of yourself and so does he. He pulls you to your feet and wraps his arm around your shoulders. \u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019ll go with you. This is something you have to do. I won\u2019t leave you. I\u2019ll be right there beside you the whole time.\u201d\n\n\n\nOfficer Jarvis reaches past you and pulls the door open. It is standing room only inside the building. Beyond the partition separating this area from the main gym, there are rows and rows of little white folding chairs reaching from one side of the basketball court all the way to the other where a long white box lays on its back with its lid standing open and draped in a filmy white shroud.\n\nThere is a line of people snaking its way back and forth between silver poles attached together at their top by thick red velvet ropes and up through the center of the packed seats. There is a dull roar permeating the building, but you don\u2019t see anyone talking.\n\nHe walks behind you with a hand on each shoulder, steering you toward the back of the line. Everyone else is dressed in nice clothes and suits, but you still have on the same ones you\u2019ve been wearing since the first night you got here.\n\nThe line moves along at a snails pace. By the time you finally approach the open box, you are rocking back and forth from one leg to the other. It\u2019s not that you have to go so much as it is the anticipation of reaching the end of this line.\n\n\u201cShe is so young,\u201d you hear the gray-haired woman in front of you say, \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy.\u201d\n\nWhen the last of the people part in front of you and wander off toward the far end of the basketball court, you feel Officer Jarvis\u2019 hands give your shoulders a light squeeze. You know you have to walk the few remaining feet to look into the box, but your feet no longer want to cooperate. You stand there frozen \u2014 needing to see, but not wanting to with every fiber of your being.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d\n\nHe finally steps up beside you and wraps his arm around your shoulders\u2014gently lifting and half carries you the last remaining steps. You squinch your eyes shut as tightly as you can and your whole body starts to spasm from the bottom of your feet all the way to your scalp.\n\nThe moment stretches on and on, and just when you feel like you might make it, your eyelids slowly begin to part of their own accord.\n\nEverything is blurry at first, almost as if you are looking through a sheet of water on a window pane. The ultra fine netting gives the contents an almost supernatural feel\u2014as if looking through a wispy cloud. Your eyes slowly follow the contour of the fabric sewn to the inside of the lid and come to rest on the sweetest face you have known in your short life.\n\nShe looks so pleasant, as if she were only lying there, sleeping. The stern expression she always wore is completely gone from her face now and she looks so content, so peaceful. She\u2019s wearing a dark blue dress spattered in tiny white flowers and her fingers are laced together below its wide lace collar. Her hair is combed out neatly and drawn back in a white ribbon that\u2019s tied in a bow off to one side.\n\nYou feel like you could just reach out and gently shake her awake, but you know you really can\u2019t. She\u2019s not merely asleep now\u2014she is gone. And with that realization, your eyes begin to burn and you feel a flood cascading down the sides of your face and dripping off your chin onto your bare chest.\n\n\u201cOkay, we can go now. We need to find us a place to sit for the service,\u201d he says, curling your trembling body into his as he walks you around the far end of the room.\n\nAll the seats on the court are filled so he takes you back toward the stairway leading up to the bleachers where many people have already seated themselves.\n\nAs you round the corner, you see an exit sign over a door with a shiny metal bar across it and another closer one hanging from the ceiling that reads \u201crestrooms\u201d with an arrow pointing down a hall. You point up at it and he nods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be up in the stands. Come find me when you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nYou nod up at him and head down the hall.\n\n\n\nYou feel somewhat better after relieving your bladder, but you stare into the steel mirror at a boy that you don\u2019t recognize any longer. You slap some water on your face to wash away the dust and slump forward with your hands on the edge of the sink. Nothing about this is right. The world just doesn\u2019t make any sense anymore.\n\nYou pound your fists against the top of the sink and then turn toward the door. You see a paper towel dispenser and grab a couple on your way out.\n\nWhen you reach the end of the short hall you turn toward the gym, but instead of walking that way you push against the steel bar with your back\u2014feeling a twinge of pain as you do so\u2014and step through into the sunlight.\n\nYou have to get away from here.\n\n\n\nWhen you get back to the \u201csecret place\u201d, you\u2019ve already decided to head West. You don\u2019t have a choice any longer. You have to do this for Jane. And you have to do this now. It can\u2019t wait.\n\nYou begin carefully packing everything into the bag of covers. You dump the change jar into the bread wrapper to save space. You fill two of the screw-top bottles\u2014and the root beer bottles, in which you have crammed wads of waxed paper that you found in the cabinets as makeshift corks, since you\u2019ll be able to sell them somewhere along the way\u2014with water. The last thing you pack is an old paring knife that has its very tip broken off. It fits perfectly in the \u2018treasure chest\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave as soon as it gets dark so no one sees you. Maybe there will be another train in the staging yard. If there isn\u2019t, you\u2019ll just keep on going until you do find one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the Night", "result": "You try to focus on staying between the tracks and not on the darkness that is slowly swallowing you. Every once in a while, the side of your foot glances off one metal rail or the other and you take a step more toward the center. You have to be careful not to turn your ankle since you can only feel your way over the unevenness of cross ties and gravel.\n\nThere is no moon or even a single star in sky above you, but you can\u2019t risk taking a look upward in case something should brush against you and you should need to suddenly run in the opposite direction.\n\nThere is a fine mist in the air and every once in a while a small droplet smacks into your clammy skin making you wince. Your heart is sprinting, but your feet take their own sweet time.\n\nYou have to make it as far as you can before the sun peeks over the horizon. You don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to survive another beating.\n\n\n\nYou hear a low, rumbling growl coming from all around you. You can feel it more than hear it. The skin behind your ears tingles and your neck hairs prickle.\n\nYou spin around and around, swinging the bag like a baseball bat and desperately roar as loud as you can to scare off whatever it is that has you surrounded. Your tears burn your eyes and your heart tries to escape through your ears.\n\nIt\u2019s getting closer.\n\nYou scream at the thing in the darkness and hear it reverberate back to you, growing louder and louder. Your feet will no longer obey and your skin has become so stiff that if you could somehow move it would probably rip wide open.\n\nYou close your eyes and grit your teeth. Your whole face feels swollen.\n\nThe rumble has become so loud now that you can feel it welling up from the ground and into your feet. You can\u2019t even draw in breath anymore.\n\nA sudden trumpeting roar blasts from behind you and you spin around to see shining eyes in the blackness. They are so bright that you can barely even look at them.\n\nYou turn on your heels and can see the tracks stretching out ahead of you. You run.\n\nThe thing is getting closer and closer. You spot a ravine shrouded in blackness off to the side and dive for it with every ounce of your being. Gravel plows through your forearms up to your elbows and you strike the side of your head on something solid.\n\nIt is on you now. The wind swirls all around you threatening to rip you from the ground.\n\nYou flip over and shield yourself with the bag as the thing races past. Through the flashes of light in your vision you can make out a shuttering silhouette and a slow realization bubbles its way to the surface.\n\nIt is no vile beast, but a train moving at breakneck speed.\n\nYou roll over onto your belly and push yourself up to your knees. You can see the light on the front piercing its way through the night. You turn and look back toward the other end and can see red lights bringing up the rear.\n\nYour burning skin begins to gradually freeze as your breath slowly returns to you and your heartbeat softens and slows.\n\nYou gently caress your gritty forearms and pluck tiny stones from the soft fleshy underside.\n\nYou get back to your feet and climb the grade as the final car zooms by. In the dim glow, you can see the tracks clearly. After looking back to make sure there isn\u2019t another one coming, you step back in the middle and continue on your way.\n\nYou keep your eyes on the train until the tail light finally winks out of sight allowing the darkness to flood back in around you.\n\n\n\nYou are exhausted. You\u2019ve been walking all night and your muscles are stiff and aching\u2014almost feverish. You need sleep, but the sky has only started to gray behind you. You can barely make out the ground around you, but still can\u2019t see anything more distant. You\u2019ll have to find some place that you won\u2019t be discovered as soon as there is enough light for you to see by.\n\nThe bandages are pulling at your skin from the middle of your back to halfway down your legs and the burning emanating from under them sends a jolt from the base of your scalp all the way to your feet. With every step, the bag you have slung over your shoulder pounds more pain through your body.\n\nIt finally gets light enough that you can see. You spot a stand of high grass over by a barbed wire fence that will easily conceal you from sight. Not caring about snakes or whatever else might be lurking in there, you wade right into the middle of it and fall face down. You barely manage to pull the bag under your head before sleep takes you.\n\n\n\nYou wake up with the bright sun on your face and it\u2019s too unbearable to open your eyelids. You shield your face with your hand as you roll over onto your side and when your leg strikes the ground it burns like fire.\n\nYou forget all about the burning brightness and look down at your leg. It is beet red all the way up to your cutoffs and starts again at your belly. Your whole front is sunburned and even lightly touching it makes you wince.\n\nYou carefully shove yourself to your feet and look as far around you as you can see. Just beyond the pasture on the other side of the fence, the trees are thick and you can only see darkness within. There are no houses or roads within sight\u2014only the train tracks.\n\nYou are extremely thirsty so you pull one of the screw-top bottles from the sack and gulp down several swallows before picking up the sack and slinging it over your shoulder. You head back to the tracks and\u2014after taking another look around\u2014continue on.", "action_results": [{"action": "A New Normal", "result": "You\u2019ve walked for most of the day\u2014going off the embankment and crouching low whenever you spot a farmhouse, someone toiling away in their field or a car on a nearby dirt road\u2014and the light is leaving fast when you hear yipping coming from behind you.\n\nWhen you turn to look, you see a pack of dogs. No, not dogs, because these are all gray. They don\u2019t look as big as the ones in the movies, but they must be wolves! What else could they be out here in the wilderness?\n\nYou quicken your pace and keep looking back at them over your shoulder. Even though they are definitely following you they don\u2019t seem to be gaining. Maybe they\u2019re waiting for it to get dark before they sneak up on you and attack. They can probably smell the dried blood on your bandages and want to eat you.\n\nYou look around for somewhere to hide, but there isn\u2019t any place. All the trees nearby are scraggly and you don\u2019t really like the idea of trying to stay awake in a tree all night anyway so you keep moving.\n\nBefore long you start to notice the stars coming out and the night insects are starting to come to life. You turn around to look at how far back the wolves are and can\u2019t see any of them.\n\nMaybe they are sneaking around to ambush you or maybe they lost interest and moved off in a different direction. Either way, you quicken your pace a little more just to be safe.\n\nYou happen to spot a long heavy stick at the bottom of the embankment and quickly rush down to get it. It is rather light and just a little longer than you are tall. It\u2019s a perfect walking stick and will make a nice weapon in case the wolves decide to attack.\n\nYour weariness catches up to you. You have to stop every couple of miles to get off your feet and take a breather. The grassy embankment feels so cool and invigorating against your bare skin. You don\u2019t dare stop for long or you\u2019ll fall asleep for sure. Eventually, though, you do.\n\nYour sleep is disturbed by the train screaming by in the night, but you are so tired that all you do is roll over away from the sound. You don\u2019t have the strength to even raise up to look at it. Then it is gone into the place where dreams live.\n\nWhen you wake up, it\u2019s still full dark and you have no idea whether you only slept for a few minutes or for several hours.\n\nYou decide to eat a few crackers and polish off your first bottle of water before you set out again. The bottle isn\u2019t worth anything so you decide to save some weight and pitch it aside. Your leg muscles feel like blocks of wood from complete exhaustion and you have some trouble controlling them.\n\nYou also take the time to carefully tear the tape from your back and legs. It\u2019s been on so long that it feels as if it has grown into the skin. Most of the tenderness is gone, but there are still slimy scabs underneath. You can\u2019t see them in the dark, but you can guess that they are all different shades from blue-gray to yellow-green like they were the last time your mom got really mad at you.\n\nAfter about an hour or so of walking you see the first rays of dawn on the horizon. There is a faint mist blanketing the field off to your left and a dark, dense thicket of trees to your right. Either place could be concealing all manner of things intent on doing you harm, but you don\u2019t have the time or the energy to dwell on it.\n\nMosquitoes whine all around your face and you can feel them lighting on your bare skin. It isn\u2019t long before the itching begins driving you mad so you take to jogging in the hopes that they can\u2019t keep up. It works for the most part, but in rays of the cresting sun you can see wispy clouds of them swarming off to the sides and on down the line. All you can hope for is to avoid the biggest share of them.\n\nThe sun has barely cleared the horizon when up ahead, you see a train parked on the side track of this town\u2019s staging yard. There are a couple of men milling around so you step over the rail and head down the short gravel slope to the ditch filled with stagnant water. There is a line of trees several yards beyond the slough which looks like the perfect cover to make your way up the line without being seen.\n\nYou take off your flipflops to wade through the ankle deep muck and on the other side you drag your feet through the knee deep grass until the slime and mud are mostly wiped away before slipping them back on.\n\nConcealing yourself behind small trees, you make your way up to the train. The doors are closed on the few boxcars you see at this end so you keep moving until you find another short string. They too have their doors pulled shut so you keep moving.\n\nYou finally near the front end and can see the engine idling beyond the switch on the main track. You can barely hear any other sounds over its rumble. So that you aren\u2019t spotted by someone up there, you duck back behind the boxcars and make your way back toward denser cover.\n\nSince all the boxcars along its length appear to be locked up tight, you\u2019ll either have to come up with some other place to board or else continue your journey on foot.\n\nThere are several flatcars loaded with timbers and other things that are tightly packed and don\u2019t offer any cover, a few with truck van trailers, but the ones that interest you most are two together with new farm implements chained down. Some of them appear high enough off the bed that you could squeeze under them where it would be hard for someone to see you unless they were really trying.", "action_results": [{"action": "From the Jaws of Death", "result": "You start to head over to one when you notice a pair of legs walking on the other side toward the back end of the train.

It is still moving slower than you can walk so you sling your walking stick and bag up on it before grabbing a chain to haul yourself up. You throw your leg over the deck and when you try to wriggle up it slips off. You try again and again as the train slowly picks up speed, but you no matter how hard you try to climb up you can\u2019t get enough leverage with the train moving like this.\n\nYou jump up to try and snag your stuff, but it\u2019s just out of reach so you desperately look around for another stick or anything that would allow you to reach it. There is nothing but gravel so you give it one last try with everything you have.\n\nYou make a run at it again and try to swing your weight up over the side, but fall and land hard on the rail. A shooting pain courses through your ribs making it hard to catch your breath. You lay there for a second to let the pain go away when you remember that the train is moving. You glance over and see the steel wheels are nearly upon you so you roll away as fast as you can, but you can\u2019t move fast enough and they keep getting closer and closer. You try to scream and all that escapes is air.\n\nJust then, large hands clamp down on your shoulders and you feel yourself being yanked from the jaws of death. One of your flipflops slips off and you try to reach back and grab it, but it\u2019s too late. Your heart is pounding and the world is swirling all around you. Everything within your field of vision has taken on a hellish red hue.\n\nBefore you even know what is happening, those same hands pick you up and sling you on up on the deck. You tumble and roll until slamming into one of the farm implements brings you to a sudden stop.\n\nStunned, you finally manage to look around to see what in the world just happened and you see a tall scraggly man in a old gray sports coat with leather elbows on the sleeves pulling himself up on the side of the car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I happened along or you\u2019d have been cut clean in half.

You only have one more pack left and they\u2019re mostly crushed, but you won\u2019t mind that a bit when you get hungry again. You stuff one in your mouth and grab a few more for good measure.

Sometimes they just run you off and sometimes they call the police.\u201d\n\nYou stand up, pick up your bag with your free hand and stand next to Harvey at the side of the flatcar. Still wiping the sleep from your eyes you suddenly think about the jagged gravel that you know is down there where you must jump, but can\u2019t see in this light.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can jump.

The shock to your knee shoots a bolt of pain through your leg, but it goes away as soon as your bare foot touches down on the jagged chunks of rock. You grit your teeth even though it isn\u2019t as bad as you thought it would be.\n\nYou sling your bag over your shoulder and\u2014leaning hard on your walking stick\u2014limp back toward where Harvey jumped off.

You can have it back later.\u201d\n\nA short time later, you come to a dirt access road and Harvey sets you down. He\u2019s bent over huffing and puffing and it takes him a while to get his breath back. It\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s older than he looks. The lines in his face have deepened and there are shadows under his eyes. Eventually he catches his breath and straightens up.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a better way,\u201d he says, \u201cWhatcha got in the bag?

I needed that.\u201d\n\nYou take a couple of swallows for yourself before putting it back in the bag. The bottles clink and clank against each other so you roll the bag up tight against them to keep them from breaking.\n\nYou do your best to tie the wrapped blanket around your foot, but can\u2019t make it stay on so Harvey takes over and by the time he\u2019s done you look like you\u2019re wearing a golf bag on your leg. You feel like Frankenstein when you walk with your leg stiff like this, but it beats jabbing your foot on sharp things.\n\n\u201cI guess we oughta find some food. What do you feel like, kid, steak or lobster?\u201d chuckling to himself.\n\nYou just stare back at him.\n\n\u201cThat looks like a fine place to eat,\u201d he says, pointing through the trees to a small house. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t need a reservation.\u201d\n\nYou follow him through the trees curious as to how he\u2019s going to get someone to give him food.\n\nYou\u2019re at his heels when he raps on the door and as he steps back he nearly runs you over.

There\u2019s no telling what she might do to you this time.\n\nYou walk over and find a comfy spot and sit down. While you wait, you pull out your map and look for the highway number that you saw when you were near here with Jane. You were focusing your attention on Harvey this time and didn\u2019t notice it this time. It doesn\u2019t look very far away from home on the map, but the deputy had said it was eighty miles and eighty miles is a long way.\n\nYou put the map back in the \u2018treasure chest\u2019 and lean back\u2014soaking up the coolness of the shade. Your eyes start to glaze over so you sit up and give yourself a couple of light slaps to make the sleepiness go away.\n\nYou\u2019ve been sitting here a long time and start to wonder what\u2019s taking Harvey so long to get back. It shouldn\u2019t take this long to ask for fishing line and a couple of hooks. Maybe he decided not to come back. Maybe he figured it would be better not to have to travel with a kid.\n\nGetting to your feet and picking up the bag, you decide you should at least take a peek and see if he\u2019s anywhere to be seen.

Oh, and this here shirt is for you, too.\u201d\n\nHe helps you untie the blanket and repack your bag. He doesn\u2019t open the \u2018treasure chest\u2019 and only packs it in tight with everything else. You mentally let out a sigh of relief. If stealing stuff from a house didn\u2019t bother him, what would he have done if he\u2019d found your money? It makes you wonder if those people actually gave him this stuff or if he stole it, too.\n\nThe shoes are a bit loose on you, but you lace them up good and tight and they only flop a little bit when you walk in them.

It still itches a little, but you are careful not to scratch it so you don\u2019t open the scabs and start it bleeding all over again. You look up at the clouds floating by and realize that it has been a long time since you took the time to really stop and look around at anything. You find yourself swinging your feet and whistling softly through your teeth\u2014just like you used to do when your dad took you fishing before he and your mom got a divorce. Everything was perfect back then and everyone was always so happy. You long to be back there because now the whole world has gone crazy and you\u2019re having a hard time just keeping up.\n\nYou don\u2019t notice the slight tugging at your line, but when it is nearly jerked from your grasp you yank on it with too much force. You know better than to do that. That\u2019s how fish get away.\n\nYou look down at your line and see a tiny perch flopping on the end of it. You can hardly believe your eyes. The little fish must\u2019ve really thought that your shirt tag was something to eat. \u201cI got one! I caught a fish!\u201d\n\n\u201cShh. Not so loud. You don\u2019t want to scare off all the other fish, do you?\u201d Harvey says, craning his neck to look upriver. \u201cBring it over here and let me see it.\u201d\n\nYou do as he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s only a little one so we gotta throw it back.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head. \u201cThis one\u2019s gonna be our catfish bait.\u201d He worries the hook out and guts the tiny little fish.

You remember your dad telling you that you have to turn the little fish loose so they can grow up to be big fish. If you didn\u2019t, there wouldn\u2019t be any big fish for other people to catch. You look back over at Harvey and wonder if he really has any idea what he\u2019s doing after all.\n\nAfter spending the whole day fishing, there\u2019s only one channel cat and a couple of medium perches to show for it. Harvey did end up throwing several small fish back so it eased your mind about that somewhat. When it came time to clean and cook the fish, he showed you how to tie a fish to the end of a forked stick and stake it on with smaller ones sharpened into little skewers so it wouldn\u2019t fall off in the campfire. You are basically roasting them like marshmallows which was kind of neat and fun. It reminded you of the camp-outs you had with your parents when you were little.\n\nTo round out the meal, you sift through the shattered crackers and pick out the biggest chunks. Harvey eats most of the fish and crackers and before he is through you feel like you wouldn\u2019t be able to hold in even one more bite if you wanted to.\n\nYou collapse into a heap and begin thinking about how almost the entire day was wasted. You could be a long way from here right now\u2014even if you had to walk to do it. Sure, you needed the rest, but not as much as you needed to cover the ground. You\u2019ll have to try to make up for all this lost time tomorrow and if that means going on alone then so be it. Getting to the Grand Canyon for Jane is the most important thing. It\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "action_results": [{"action": "Life on the Road", "result": "You wake up before the sun and begin readying your pack for the road ahead. Harvey occasionally grunts in his sleep and you don\u2019t dare wake him unless it is a real emergency. That\u2019s just the way it is with grownups.\n\nWhen you get tired of waiting, you decide to throw your line in the murky water. It isn\u2019t that you are hungry, but you are nearly out of food and if you had a fish to tide you over in the afternoon it would save time\u2014and the hassle\u2014in the long run. You find a decent looking gut that isn\u2019t too big or too small to skewer onto your hook and pitch your line out as far as it will go.\n\nAfter more than an hour, you still haven\u2019t had even a nibble and are about to give up when the sun finally peeks over the horizon. The warmth is overwhelming and the world around you sort of melts away. It is so comforting to just stand here and bask in the rays of the new day.\n\nJust then, your pole snaps and you are startled back into reality. \u201cAhhh!\u201d Something big has tied onto your line and with the way it is thrashing, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to haul it in. You dig in with your heels and strain with all you have, but the mud is slick and you are being dragged toward the water. The surface opens up in a geyser revealing the biggest catfish you have ever seen. It is a sleek and silky, bluish-gray catfish and you can only stand there while the spray engulfs you in slow motion.\n\n\u201cWha- What\u2019s going on?!\u201d you hear from behind you along with quite a ruckus. Harvey scrambles up beside you and is still rubbing the bleariness out of his eyes when it finally dawns on him that you need help so he reaches out and snags the end of your pole. \u201cThis guy\u2019s enough to feed an entire army!\u201d\n\nBy the time all the chunks have cooked the sun is already high. You\u2019ve lost so much time already that when you finally do head off down the tracks you have to continually slow down to let Harvey catch up even though your paces are two to his one. You try not to even stop to rest when he suggests it, but he\u2019s not as young as you are so you have to give him the occasional breather.\n\nThe miles tend to run together and then the days. It\u2019s a long way between towns and by the time you finally get within sight of one that is little more than a far away dot, you\u2019ve long since eaten the last morsel of fish. Harvey has pointed out a few edible plants along the way\u2014none of which are very appetizing, but they don\u2019t kill you or even make you sick\u2014which is better than having nothing at all on your stomach. He shows you how to skin prickly pears so you can eat them, but they are so bland that you can only stand to chew them until all the moisture is gone and then spit out the remnants when he\u2019s not looking.\n\nIt\u2019s about midday when you run up on another farmhouse about a half a mile from the tracks.\n\n\u201cWait here,\u201d Harvey says, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a jiff.\u201d\n\nYou watch as he crosses the over-grazed pasture and strides up to the front door. After a couple minutes, you see him disappear around the side only to return a few minutes later cradling something in his arms. When he gets close enough, you can see that what he\u2019s carrying is eggs.\n\n\u201cI got us a real treat, boy.\u201d\n\nYou look up at him and give a half-smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t had eggs in a long, long time. How are we gonna cook \u2018em? We don\u2019t have a pan or anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave that to me. Where there\u2019s a will\u2014there\u2019s a way.\u201d\n\nAfter a short ways, he picks up an old tin can and peers into it while holding it up to the sun. \u201cThis\u2019ll do nicely. You got any of that water left?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You reach into the bag and pull a bottle out. \u201cIt\u2019s the last one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be more than enough. We\u2019ll get some more the next place we run on to.\u201d\n\nHe steps off to the side of the tracks and kicks an area bare with his foot. He starts piling dried grass, twigs and whatever else he finds and then lights it. You quickly run around gathering more bits of dried wood and before you know it, the can is boiling away so he pulls it off to the side a couple inches\u2014enough that it can still get heat, but not so much that it loses all of its water. Then, the two of you sit back and watch it for a few minutes.\n\n\u201cThat oughta be enough.\u201d He pulls his hand inside his sleeve and uses the cuff like a hot pad. After dumping the water on the fire, he kicks it around a little bit to make sure it is completely out. \u201cWe\u2019ll let these cool off while we walk and come supper time we\u2019ll have us a real treat.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really want to wait, but you know he\u2019s right so you do your best to put it out of your mind and think about other things.\n\nAll at once, you notice that there are suddenly more houses around. You didn\u2019t even realize how much you\u2019d traveled since you first saw this town as a far off speck.\n\n\u201cWith any luck, we\u2019ll be able to catch a train out of this bump in the road. I don\u2019t think my feet can take too many more miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to fill up the bottles with water.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe oughta find a milk jug or two instead. Those glass bottles you got are empty weight. If you\u2019re going to be lugging something around, it oughta be more water.\u201d\n\nYou nod in agreement.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wrench in the Cogs", "result": "Crossing the street to a gas station, you spot a police car coming toward you from down the street. You step up your pace and put Harvey between you and it. You look around for a place to hide, but there isn\u2019t anything close. You prepare yourself in case he stops, but all you can hope for is to run as fast as you can and hope that you can get away. You let out a sigh as it goes on by and the officer behind the wheel doesn\u2019t even look over at you.\n\nStepping through the open door, you are hit by a blast of not quite so hot air. A big shop fan rests against the back wall and is aimed directly at the door. A nice looking man in thick glasses and stained coveralls sits just to the right of it and has his nose buried in a newspaper.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d Harvey clears his throat to get the guy\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHowdy,\u201d says the attendant, leaning forward so that the legs of his folding chair touch the floor, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were hoping to get some water. Drinking water. And maybe a jug or something to put it in.\u201d\n\nYou can see the disappointment on the attendant\u2019s face as he draws his lips back, but it quickly shifts into a forced smile. \u201cSure thing. I think there might be one around back by the dumpster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harvey says as he heads back out the front door.\n\nYou hang back and stand there looking at the guy with a sheepish smile until you finally build up enough nerve to blurt out \u201cDo you buy bottles?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing, little man. You got some you wanna trade in?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d You dig through you bag and pull out the two root beer bottles. You stand there looking down at them and remember sharing them with Jane. You knew you\u2019d have to sell them eventually, but now you aren\u2019t sure that you really want to.\n\n\u201cJust the two, then?\u201d\n\nYou wipe the film from your eyes that has started to develop and look up at him. You nod.\n\n\u201cI think I have it right here\u2014\u201d he says, digging in his pocket. \u201cYeah, here you go. Six cents. You can put \u2018em over there with those,\u201d he points after handing you the coins.\n\nFrom the little wire rack by the front door, you grab a couple plastic tubes of peanuts. They are marked twenty-five cents and you think you have more than enough in change. You pull out the plastic bread wrapper and start counting out pennies on the only bare spot on the counter. The attendant watches you and drums his fingers impatiently.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nYou look up and see him sliding the pile off into his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not fifty cents.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is. You must\u2019ve just miscounted.\u201d\n\nYou grin up at him. You\u2019d only given him a little over thirty cents so either he is really nice and doing you a favor or else he just doesn\u2019t want all your pennies. He smiles warmly back.\n\nYou quickly twist the bag of money and shove it way down deep in your pocket before Harvey comes back. He seems that he\u2019s on your side so far, but if he can steal from random strangers he might just take from you, too. You drop the peanuts into your bag for later in case you have to go too long without food.\n\nYou\u2019re leaning with your back against the metal door frame when Harvey returns with two jugs. He and the attendant talk briefly before the two of you head around the side of the building to the faucet and fill the jugs. You have a huge lump in your throat and barely even take notice of anything around you for quite a little while. Even bending down and taking giant gulps straight from the spigot doesn\u2019t make it go down. It just sort of hangs there. The last thing you do is pitch the last whiskey bottle in the dumpster before the two of you head back toward the tracks.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s several hours before a train comes into view. You hear the blasting horn from miles away and you sit staring in the direction of the blast. It is going the wrong way, however, so you have to keep waiting. You and Harvey have found yourselves a nice comfy spot in the shade of a metal building in some scrub brush where no one can see you.\n\nHarvey has been leaning with his back against a small tree and every once in a while he lets out a snort that would wake any normal person from a sound sleep. Not him, though. Even though he\u2019s had much more rest than you, he still looks like an old, old man. His gray doesn\u2019t end at his hairline, but keeps going all the way down his face subcutaneously.\n\nSometime before dark and just when you finally feel like you could stand some sleep yourself, you hear a long, blaring horn from the opposite direction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our ride,\u201d says Harvey, opening his eyes and stretching to get the kinks out.\n\nYou watch as the engine finally enters the yard, but it keeps going and doesn\u2019t slow any more than a fast walking pace. Harvey cranes his neck and strains to try and see further down its length. There are no boxcars. All you can see are flatcars and hoppers. A long stretch of flatcars are loaded with sea containers probably bound for the coast and don\u2019t offer any space at all around them, but one of the last cars is only half full at the back.\n\nHarvey trots toward it and you dash around him. After lofting your bag over the side, he grabs you around your middle and hefts you up. He tosses his coat and the water jugs at your feet before trotting up to the very front where there is a step.\n\n\u201cHey! Get away from there!\u201d you hear coming from the tail end of the train. \u201cThat\u2019s private property!\u201d\n\nYou duck into a corner made by the slightly mismatched cargo containers and watch as Harvey takes a step backward. He looks up at you as the train whisks you by and turns away from the tracks. You peek around the container to see two men rush up to him. They take him by the arms and lead him back across the tracks. One of them is talking on a walkie-talkie. What are they going to do to him?\n\nDid they see you? You have no idea. If they did, they might call ahead to stop the train and then what would you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Go back for Harvey", "result": "You shove Harvey\u2019s coat into your bag and wait until the yard is out of sight before jumping off. The train has picked up a little speed and you end up rolling headlong in the gravel, but only end up with a couple of small scrapes. There will be other trains or maybe Harvey will have another idea. You can\u2019t just bear to take his stuff and go on without him.\n\nBy the time you get back to the train yard there is no one in sight. You don\u2019t know what to do. You can\u2019t just start walking around town looking for him. What if that cop sees you? He\u2019ll take you back to your Mom and after what she did last time\u2014well, that\u2019s just too awful to even think about.\n\nYou hang around the train yard for a little while being sure to keep out of sight until it is full dark and then walk over to the street where the gas station is. You don\u2019t see any sign of Harvey. In fact, the street is completely deserted so you head back to the tracks.\n\nThere\u2019s a strange sense of deja vu as you walk between the rails. It\u2019s not quite as scary this time, but things are still creeping around out there just out of sight. You wish that you still had your stick with you. You must\u2019ve left it back at the river. That\u2019s the last place you remember seeing it.\n\nAbout a mile or so away from town, you see a small cinder block building with a light on the front of it above a blue door out in the middle of a field and just behind it there\u2019s an earthen dam. It looks like it might be a good place to stay the night.\n\nYou walk over to it and try to open the door, but it\u2019s locked so you go around to the side where it\u2019s dark and slump down against the wall.\n\nYou are getting rather hungry so you reach in your bag to get a package of peanuts when you remember the eggs. Too bad Harvey isn\u2019t around to enjoy them. You take out two and take your time eating them. You fiddle with the shells\u2014not wanting to go to sleep out here in the open, but there is a little light to see by so you don\u2019t feel quite as skittish\u2014and end up crumbling them into tiny bits only slightly bigger than sand before finally casting them out into the wiry grass.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sitting there long before the day catches up with you and you drift off to sleep.\n\n\n\nYou wake up before the sun and find it right nippy out so you put on Harvey\u2019s coat. Your legs are stiff and there\u2019s a crick in your back. Your arms feel like they are about to fall off from carrying the extra weight of the water jugs. There has to be something you can do about it. You can\u2019t keep juggling all this stuff and expect to last very long.\n\nAt long last, the sun finally pops up and the dew steams off the tracks. It won\u2019t be long until it gets warm enough that you won\u2019t need the coat anymore and that gives you an idea.\n\nYou pull your arms out of the sleeves and tie a jug to each one\u2014letting them flop in front of you while you keep the coat on like a cape. It\u2019s not pretty, but it frees up your hands so that all you have to worry about is holding onto the bag.\n\nIt isn\u2019t long before you polish off the rest of the eggs and while getting them out, you find the hooks and line. With any luck you\u2019ll run into another river or maybe a lake somewhere up ahead.\n\nYou trudge along for mile after mile as the sun creeps steadily overhead and just hangs there baking you. You keep wishing you had some kind of hat when you see something between the tracks up ahead that looks just like a dusty, smashed cowboy hat.\n\nYou pick up your pace and are nearly on it when it suddenly moves! It\u2019s a snake! And it\u2019s big one. It has a pattern of criss-crossing lines along its back and starts to make a rattling noise. You drop the bag as you fall backward. You see it draw back its head as you crab-walk the heck out of there as fast as you can.\n\nWhen you are a safe distance away, you get back to your feet. What are you going to do now? You have to get your bag back, but it\u2019s much too close to it now.\n\nYou look around and the only thing there is is the crushed limestone gravel. Perfect! You pick up a couple handfuls of the biggest chunks and start lobbing them at it to drive it away. Every single stone\u2014whether it be a hit or miss\u2014is a hit because the rattler strikes them when they get close. Every single time! And then it shakes off the impact kind of and gets ready for the next one. Before long the bottom of its mouth is kind of drooping to one side and its head is mangled, but it hangs in there. You ease a little closer being careful to stay well out of range and start pelting it with everything you have until it is little more than a pile of mush. It finally slinks over the rail and slithers into the sparse grass where it disappears completely.\n\nYou creep up and pick up your bag giving that area a wide berth before continuing on your way.", "action_results": [{"action": "Any Port in the Storm", "result": "You only now realize how late it is getting. It seems like only a couple hours ago the sun was directly overhead and now there are not even shadows at all anymore. You look around for some place to hole up for the night and the only place you see is a small grove of trees in the corner of the field some distance from the tracks. There are no people or animals within sight and you debate whether you should head over there or keep going and hope for a better spot to present itself.\n\nJust then, a loud crack nearly knocks you off your feet and everything around you is immediately thrown into high contrast. You duck instinctively, even though you are a second too late.\n\nYou look up to see the sky overhead is near black and brimming with static. The horizon behind you fades swiftly to nothing in a dingy gray curtain. You are about to get soaked!\n\nNature has made your decision for you. You don\u2019t want to be anywhere near trees during an electrical storm. And you certainly don\u2019t want to be standing on these metal tracks higher than all the ground around you for as far as you can see.\n\nYou can see a dirt road about a half a mile ahead. Perhaps you\u2019ll find some cover when you reach it. In any case, you\u2019ll be off the tracks and will no longer be a sitting duck for lightning strikes.\n\nYou run.\n\nAs you near the crossroad, you look both ways for any sign of shelter and see a bent over mail box at the end of what appears to be a driveway so you veer in that direction cutting across the ditch before even reaching the road.\n\nThere is a stitch in your side, but you keep moving. Thunder is clapping all around you and a sound like running horses is growing louder and louder.\n\nYou turn into the driveway without slowing down and find it nearly overgrown down the center. It is canted downhill and looks more like an old wash than something carved out by human hands. Only vague tire wear paths along each side show that it was once used. The spindly saplings on either side stretch out and their branches knit together overhead throwing the path into unnatural darkness. Your stomach lurches at the prospect of having to venture down such a lane, but you don\u2019t have much choice and hope that there is still some form of shelter when you reach the end of it.\n\nAs you run along weaving back and forth through the tall grass and weeds down the center of the lane from one worn path to the other to avoid the darkest areas and shrubbery that threatens to conceal any manner of creature, you hope that something isn\u2019t lying in wait just out of your vision\u2014to trip you up or is crouched and ready to pounce.\n\nThe path finally widens into a clearing and with it your spirits\u2014for across the unkempt yard you see an old derelict shotgun house whose roof has collapsed in at the back. It might not be much to look at, but it will definitely serve its purpose to keep you dry while you weather the storm that has just now caught up to you.\n\nSnow white stones pummel the ground around and in front of you and will soon tear their way through the spindly branches overhead so you have no choice but to run the gauntlet and hope that you can make it to the cover on the other side. With giant strides, you cover the ground with ice pelting you from above and ricocheting off of your shoulders and arms\u2014stinging as they bounce high and away\u2014and sure to leave welts the size of goose eggs. A couple or three times a stone smacks into your head and your vision goes fuzzy, but you are too focused on your goal to give it much thought or to succumb to the blinding pain.\n\nFinally, you spring up onto the gabled porch and dart through the framed hole in the wall that once supported a door. Everything is shrouded in a dim gloom and there is a mustiness that permeates the place. You don\u2019t see signs that anyone has been in this place for possibly years. You set your bag against the wall by the door so you can look around.\n\nBeyond the front room is a short hall on the left that leads into a darkened room. As you make your way down it, you come to a wood panel door with cracked and peeling white paint that has greened slightly with age midway and see another a little further on with a more yellowed tinge to it. Both are standing wide open and you can see only darkness in the slits between them and the door frame.\n\nInside the first room you see the remnants of a mattress leaning against the far wall partially covering a window whose muntins hold only shards and fragments of turquoise shaded glass still trapped by its web of caulk. It was probably placed there to prevent the room from being damaged by weather or overrun with critters when the first of its lights had been knocked out. The bed frame is still in the corner and the pile next to its head was most likely a nightstand that didn\u2019t fare too well with time. A pile of debris layers the floor of the built-in closet. It was undoubtedly shirts and dresses and things once upon a time and has become shredded by moths, rodents and mildew until it could no longer cling on to the wire hangers still suspended on the bar.\n\nYou wrestle the door away from the wall enough to peek behind and find nothing at all there save cobwebs and decades of dust. You shove it back against the wall and step into the room for a more thorough examination.\n\nStill hanging from a crooked nail in the closet, you find a narrow leather dress belt. You bend and wrench it and find that it still has life left in it. It could come in handy sometime, so you buckle it to its tail and sling it over your head\u2014letting it dangle at your hip like a sash. There are a few other things like a brass ash tray that\u2019s tarnished black with age, but you can\u2019t imagine a use for it and it would only weigh you down.\n\nYou check the next door and see that behind it is a tiled bathroom. There isn\u2019t much of value in here, but as you are about to leave you spot a new vinyl shower curtain still in its wrapper. It sounds a bit crunchy when you bend the package, but it might still be good enough to keep you dry if you get caught in a sudden downpour.\n\nThe back room is the kitchen, but you can\u2019t get through it or even tell what might be in there since the roof has collapsed and draped the ceiling over whatever might\u2019ve once been in here. It doesn\u2019t look too safe to even go near so you head back to the front room where you seat yourself by the open doorway and snack on a few peanuts.\n\nThe storm outside is raging and seems to be growing more violent with every passing second. At least you found a dry place to weather it. You might as well try to get some rest since it looks like you\u2019re going to be here a while so you draw the coat up as tightly as you can and slump your back against the wall.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ghosts From the Past", "result": "Sleep doesn\u2019t come easily with all the thunderclaps.

If you move even a foot to either side, something could grab you through a window and if you move over to the far wall, the hallway would be at your back. As it is now, something could reach through and grab you from the doorway so you draw your feet under you and are poised to spring away.\n\nSomething is scraping around in the kitchen now. You can barely make it out above the howl of the wind, but it is there. You still can\u2019t make anything out through the darkness\u2014which only deepens with each strobe from the storm.\n\nSomething is watching you. You slowly turn your head to one side to see out of the windows along that wall and only see blackness. Your hands are all sweaty so you try to wipe them off on your shirt, but it is still damp and doesn\u2019t do much good at all. Lightning flashes overhead and you can see that there\u2019s nothing outside the windows.\n\nYou slowly pivot your head toward the windows on the opposite wall and notice how much blacker the room has become. Your ears begin to burn and prickle. You don\u2019t dare make any sudden movement. You hear the ambient rumble emanating from all around you with only slight variances every now and again. What happened to all the lightning? Why is it taking so long?\n\nThen it is suddenly and briefly daylight outside and you can see that the windows are empty. Does it know when the flashes will come and only hide until it gets dark again?\n\nSomething moves in front of you! It is only a black shape against the darkness and you can see it getting taller\u2014as if it is getting to its feet. Your legs won\u2019t work and your chest feels heavy. You can\u2019t see its face, but can feel the too wide grin creeping slowly across it. Its eyes burn into you though you cannot see them.\n\nYou can see more of them writhing in background, waiting. They slither this way and that, but aren\u2019t drawing any closer.\n\nThe thing is still just black on black, but it is drawing ever nearer as it glides toward you. It is getting larger and larger. You can feel it reaching its long bony talons out toward you and its shriveled lips part open.\n\nDon\u2019t worry. No one ever comes here. This place is \u2018bandoned.\n\nYou nearly jump out of your skin and your eyes snap open. Was it a only dream or did you actually just hear those words?\n\nYou rapidly swivel your head back and forth trying to get a handle on where it is. All you can see is blackness that goes gray with each heartbeat. The rumble outside has become more distant and there are no longer any lightning flashes to illuminate the room. You pick up your bag and hold it in front of you as a makeshift shield.\n\nGet that little BASTARD!\n\nYou are on your feet and running through the night in the direction that you believe the driveway is.

The pounding in your ears blocks out all other sound and you wouldn\u2019t know if something was coming up on you in the blackness\u2014no matter how much racket it was making.\n\nEons pass and you finally see the first twinkle among the clouds. The sky slowly withdraws its veil letting more and more tiny lights shine through. All around you there is a comforting bluish glow. The grass seems to be lit from within and it feels like you can see for miles and miles\u2014as if you are in some supernatural sea. The serenity seeps into your soul and your previous terror is completely replaced with awe and wonder.\n\nThe sun spills over the horizon and washes across the landscape and you are momentarily blinded by the glint of steel. The tracks are but a short distance away. You must have turned and run along beside them in your panic. A great double rainbow cinches the whole world together and everything is suddenly new again.

You can hear the engine reverberating and there are bright lights on tripods scattered all around. There are some flatcars with men busy loading large crates onto them using forklifts from the loading dock and in the gloom between them and the engine is a string of boxcars.

You only have to wait for the right moment.\n\nAfter the crates have been chained down and the forklifts have gone away, the men start taking the lights down one by one and you hear the engine slowly rev up. You\u2019ll have to time this just right.\n\nLuck is on your side. There is no one in sight when the train starts inching forward and you make your dash. You make your way as quickly between the slatted crates and the wall as you can to the front of the car where you find just enough crawl space to conceal yourself and your stuff.\n\nThe smell is overpowering and your mouth begins to water uncontrollably.

The thought strikes you that you could take a couple along with you for good measure when you leave the train so while you\u2019re filling your gullet you also pry off enough of the slats to pull out a couple of good sized ones and pack them in the blanket in your bag.\n\nWhen you\u2019re finally lulled to sleep by the clacking rails, you are returned to the night you and Jane spent on that train and all the plans you and she had made. Only this time, the two of you are on your way to see the Grand Canyon and are without a care in the world.

There are colorful rocky outcroppings jutting out from everywhere and you see a herd of small deer pawing and licking at one of them.\n\nYou watch small towns drift by in the distance and for a while the train runs alongside a highway filled with car after car from one end to the other for as far as you can see and wonder how there can be so many people.

You hear the boom a split-second later.\n\nHe\u2019s shooting at you!\n\nYou scamper with everything you have and don\u2019t stop until you\u2019re back on the other side of the embankment. You lay prone with your eyes peeled for any sign of movement coming over the rise and, when your heart finally slows, you look down at the single piece of fruit in your hand. At least it\u2019s something.\n\nYou take a bite and feel your face attempt to implode. The tomato isn\u2019t ripe, but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s food and moisture all in one and you\u2019ve been without either for much too long.\n\nAfter all the commotion and dogs\u2019 barking finally peters out, you creep back to retrieve your bag and continue on down the tracks.\n\n\n\nYou see the back of a big truck stop over on the highway up ahead of you about a mile or two away with a constant stream of vehicles coming and going. The moon is just coming up and from the glint on the tracks it looks like they might come really close to it. It would be a good place to fill up your water jugs. You might be able to blend in among all those people and them not even suspect that you are all alone out here.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a lot of money, but maybe you can find some food that you can afford with the little bit of change you still have in your pocket. A couple of cheese crackers or the peanut butter kind would go really good right about now.\n\nWhen you get to a spot that is almost directly behind it, you set your bag down in the grass off to the side of the tracks and\u2014taking just the jugs in hand\u2014set off across the field. As you approach the crumbling asphalt of the back parking lot, you see a water faucet next to the pay air hose. What luck! You rush over and\u2014after gulping down as much of the sweet liquid as you can\u2014fill both jugs to the brim. You lug them back across the parking lot to the knee-high grass and set them down before heading around to the front of the building.\n\nBefore going in, you pull the bread wrapper out of your pocket and sit on a yellow concrete curb to count out the change. You need to know how much you have before going inside. At long last, you decipher that there\u2019s eighty-six cents\u2014a small fortune. You still want to hold onto the dollar for a real emergency so you are only willing to spend the change. You\u2019ve got to be careful not to spend all of it, though. You might really need it later on.\n\nAs you step through the front door, you are blasted by frigid air. You\u2019d almost forgotten that such a thing even existed. Several pairs of eyes are on you, but you pretend not to notice.\n\n\u201cHis mother should be ashamed of herself. Letting a boy get so filthy,\u201d a woman with her face stretched back in a bun says to her friend who only nods in agreement.\n\nYou glance down at your hands and can\u2019t tell where the dirt ends and your skin begins. She\u2019s definitely right about how dirty you are, but if she were a nice person, she wouldn\u2019t have said it loud enough for you to hear. Maybe you should clean up before doing any shopping.\n\nYou walk up to the stocky woman behind the counter and quietly ask \u201cDo you have a bathroom?\u201d\n\nShe squints at you before saying \u201cSure do. It\u2019s right down that hall over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say, walking as quickly as you can so you can get out from under all the judgmental eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s a tiny little room with only a stainless steel toilet and sink. Above the sink is a cloudy mirror that reflects what little it has to and in the corner is a tall, skinny trash can with a flapper on top. You lock the door before stripping off you shirt and shorts so someone doesn\u2019t walk in on you. You do the best you can with wet paper towels and have to climb up on the sink to make sure you got everything off of your face and neck. After getting dressed, you sop up the floor as best you can. By the time you finally head back out the door, you are feeling fresh as the morning. The trash can, however, has seen better days.\n\nYou walk down each aisle slowly looking at what is offered. Too bad you don\u2019t have more money, because there is a lot of really good stuff you wouldn\u2019t mind having. You finally choose a big plain bag of tortilla chips that are marked \u201c3/$1\u201d. It\u2019s big enough that it should last you a good long while.\n\nThe cashier eyes you with a smirk as you count out thirty-four cents to her. You can\u2019t help grinning back at her every time you make eye contact.\n\n\u201cThank you, sir. Please come again,\u201d she says handing you back your bag of chips and giving you a wink.\n\nYou feel your face getting warm and you nod to her as you turn toward the door. You can\u2019t remember the last time you felt as relieved as you do now to get away from people. If it wouldn\u2019t seem suspicious, you would run.\n\nWrestling the two jugs while trying not to crush the bag of chips too much, you head back to the tracks and fetch your bag before continuing on your trek.\n\n\n\nYou come to a fork in the tracks and don\u2019t know which one brought you here. One continues on to the south and the other angles off into the distance in a more easterly direction and looks like it goes right through a distant town. If it\u2019s not just a mirage you might try hopping a train down there, but you aren\u2019t sure that it would be going the right way. Maybe there will be another town somewhere up ahead on the one stretching south.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue south", "result": "You\u2019ve been walking south on this line for several days now and haven\u2019t actually run into a single town. It might\u2019ve been better to wait for a train heading in this direction, but who could\u2019ve guessed that it would be so far between settlements. It was never like this back where you grew up.\n\nThe land has gradually shifted from short grass to barren and rocky with only patches here and there so you know you\u2019re getting close to where you were before taking this unfortunate detour. It\u2019s not as easy going as it has been so far and you find yourself taking more and more rest breaks. It\u2019s much easier traveling around dawn and then again at dusk so you\u2019ve been lying around and sometimes napping during midday and when it gets too dark to see snakes that might be in your path.\n\nYou\u2019ve eaten over half of your chips and drank most of your water. You\u2019ll need to find somewhere to replenish your supplies so you don\u2019t end up back in the sorry shape you were in a couple of days ago.\n\nSomewhere in the wee hours of the morning, you spot a mournful glow all by its lonesome out in the middle of nowhere some distance from the tracks. It takes a while for you to figure out that there is a house not too awful far from it, but it\u2019s hard to see since there are no lights on within. You decide to stroll on over to find out if it might be vacant, but catch a glimpse of a reflection about midway there. It looks like the windshield of a pickup. There\u2019s probably someone sleeping in the house.\n\nNot wanting a repeat of the last time you tried to sneak food away from a farmhouse, you walk around until you find a shelf of rock jutting out of the ground that\u2019s just the perfect height for surveilling the place. It isn\u2019t too long before the sky begins to gray with dawn, but you wait until the sun is full up and watch the house down below carefully from your perch on the rocky outcropping. After a few hours of biding your time, it happens.\n\nYou watch as the old pickup pulls out of the drive and turns onto the highway. It\u2019s far enough away that you can\u2019t make out the driver and the cloud of dust billowing up from it soon makes it impossible to even make out the vehicle itself.\n\nYou don\u2019t see a garden growing anywhere and the yard is nothing but sand and rocks. There is a rectangular patch of weeds up against the side fence and it seems like the only place anything is growing at all. You sling your bag over your shoulder and walk carefully across the barren field, and then right up to the house like you owned the place.\n\nYou try knocking at the front door in case someone might be inside, but no one comes. You try to open it without any success. You find that all the windows and the back door are locked up tight as well.\n\nYou notice a pipe sticking up near the weed patch with a bucket hanging upside down over it. Sure enough, you find a spigot hiding under that little devil. You fill up your jugs again and drink what you can before turning your attention back to the house.\n\nYou don\u2019t really want to smash a window, but you are getting desperate. You pick up large stone and draw your arm back when you spot something in the reflection of the glass you are about to break. It looks like a large wooden door laying at a slight angle on the ground behind you propped up by a short concrete wall. You know exactly what it is \u2014 a storm cellar, just like the one at your grandmother\u2019s house. With any luck, there\u2019ll be jars and jars of canned food just like she stores in hers because it is cooler down there and they won\u2019t go bad nearly as quickly.\n\nYou trot over to it and drop the bag. You hook your hands under and heave with all your strength. The one at Grandma\u2019s has a cable attached to a bunch of window weights strung through a pulley which makes it much easier to open and close. You have to lift the full weight of this one and it doesn\u2019t give easily.\n\nYou stand it up to more than a forty-five degree angle, but can\u2019t get it to go any further without risking falling down the hole underneath it. You try to flop it on over, but you can\u2019t give it enough push and you are already at a rather precarious angle, yourself. If you could fling it on over, you\u2019d probably wind up tumbling in head first.\n\nDesperately, you look around for anything that might help and you are about to let the door go when you see a shovel leaning against the wall at the bottom of the steps leading down. You inch your way over to the top and carefully reach down with one hand while the door threatens to buckle your other arm. You manage to snag the end of it and drag it up enough that it tips over at your feet just as your other arm tires out, but you save the door from falling down and pinning the shovel by catching hold with your free hand and letting it rest against your chest while you take a minute to catch your breath.\n\nYou pick up the shovel, jab it into the ground as best you can and lower the door onto the handle. There\u2019s just enough room for you to slip through and over the side.\n\nIt takes a minute for your eyes to adjust. There are shelves down here along one wall, but not a single jar on them. You are about to turn around when you notice that they aren\u2019t exactly empty and look a little lumpy so you go over to investigate.\n\nYou\u2019ve hit the jackpot! The shelves are covered in potatoes, onions and turnips\u2014more than you could ever hope to eat.\n\nMaking a couple of trips, you gently drop several handfuls out the door and then clamber out behind them. You stand up and dust yourself off before picking up your bag. You are just starting to drop the vegetables in when you hear a low growl off to the side.\n\nSlowly turning your head, you see the biggest hound you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. He comes up to your chest and is at least as long as you are tall. You stare back at one another and neither of you make a move.

You take a deep breath and hold it out in a trembling hand toward the massive beast. \u201cFetch?\u201d\n\nKeeping a wary eye on you, he leans forward and gives it a sniff before returning to his previous position. You can\u2019t tell one way or the other whether he\u2019s interested in it or not. Still, you have to give it a try.\n\nYou shake it lightly to get his attention. When his eyes leave you and train on it, you shake it more vigorously. You draw your arm back, snap it forward and just as you let go, you holler \u201cFetch!\u201d\n\nThe flipflop sails across the yard while both you and he just stand there watching it glide. It skips a couple of times before spinning to a stop.\n\nYou look back at the hound and he looks back at you.

You hold out a turnip to eat on the way because you are half starving after all that hard work.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to overstay your welcome so as soon as you drop the last one in, you turn tail and head back the way you came toward the tracks.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve walked nearly a mile when you hear a strange sounding cough behind you. You whirl around only to find the hound several paces away. He stops and stares up at you.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d you command, but he only looks at you. \u201cGet!\u201d\n\nYou take a couple of steps backward and he takes a couple forward. You think about picking up a rock and chucking it at him, but he\u2019s as big as you are. If you made him mad, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. The best thing to do would be to ignore him and he\u2019ll head back home on his own when he\u2019s darn good and ready.\n\nOver the course of the day, you grow more and more comfortable around your new companion and when you stop for a rest you discover that embroidered in his faded collar are the words \u201cOl\u2019 Sam\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet ya, Sam. I\u2019m Billy. I bet you\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nYou pull out a handful of chips for Sam and a turnip for yourself to munch on. He greedily wolfs them down. You\u2019re tempted to give him more, but you can\u2019t afford to since they\u2019re the only thing you have that will keep the longest and he\u2019ll probably leave soon anyway.\n\nWhen night comes and it gets too dark to see, you find a decent place to bed down and give Sam another handful of chips while you wash down an onion with lots and lots of water. You give Sam a drink in an old tin can that you found on the tracks earlier so he doesn\u2019t get too thirsty either.\n\nSam lays down alongside you and his body warmth is somehow comforting. You drift off to sleep more easily than you ever remember doing and don\u2019t stir even once in the night.\n\n\n\nThe sun is already peeking above the mountains when you wake. Even though you have kinks all over from sleeping on the ground, you feel absolutely wonderful. It\u2019s the first good nights sleep you\u2019ve had in a long, long time.\n\nAfter both of you have eaten lightly, you set off once again down the tracks. Sam isn\u2019t hanging back like he did yesterday. He walks right beside you\u2014matching you step for step. You try to take it easy on the old guy and stop for regular rest breaks, but you cover a lot more ground than usual. The day just seems to fly by and by the time night comes, you are completely worn out.\n\nYou start looking for a good spot to sleep when Sam suddenly stops and lets out a hair raising growl. You flinch instinctively and look down at him\u2014frozen in your tracks\u2014and see the hackles standing up from the top of his head to nearly the length of his back. He isn\u2019t looking at you so you follow his gaze and see something really big and tan colored crossing the tracks up ahead. It is long and has a tail that looks as long as its body. It takes you a moment to realize that it\u2019s a cat. A big cat.\n\nIt pauses and stares at you for a few moments while Sam\u2019s growls steadily grow in volume and pitch. Something about that thing clamps you down deep in the core and you can\u2019t move a single muscle. Your skin tingles and your muscles burn. Then all at once the cat shoots off like a rifle shot across the field toward the mountains in tremendous leaps until it finally fades into the background.\n\nYour legs let go and you crumple right where you stand. All your strength has evaporated and you feel cold chills running all through your body. It\u2019s a good thing Sam was here with you or that thing might\u2019ve decided you were dinner. You throw your arms around his neck and squeeze with what little you have left in you. He just stands there looking in the direction the great cat ran and doesn\u2019t move.\n\nWhen you find a spot and settle in for the night, you give Sam a double helping of tortilla chips. He finally eats the last one, but doesn\u2019t seem quite as interested in them as he did last night. You wish that you had something else you could give him, but he wouldn\u2019t like the raw vegetables nearly as much. The next time you see a gas station or store, you\u2019re going to buy him something with meat in it.\n\nYou lie down like you did last night and he stretches out against you just as he did before. You feel warm and safe and once again you sleep right straight on through.\n\n\n\nMorning comes early and as you lie there stretching the kinks out, you notice that Sam isn\u2019t there. You sit up and call \u201cSam?\u201d and don\u2019t hear anything.\n\nYou jump up and look all around as far as you can see and still there is nothing. \u201cSam!\u201d Your ears prickle as you start to think the worst. You quickly shove those thoughts aside and jump to your feet.\n\nYou run up on the higher ground of the tracks and look all around. You finally spot him way back up the tracks walking back the way you came. \u201cSam!\u201d He pauses for a moment without turning around and then continues on his way. You want to run after him, but that would only make it worse. He\u2019s been gone from his home too long already and just needs to go back. You watch him until he\u2019s little more than a speck before returning to collect your gear.\n\nYou\u2019re more wary as you go now. Your senses seem heightened and for the first time on this trip you feel more like a wild animal than a person. Your eyes are in a perpetual squint and are constantly sweeping over the terrain from one side to the other. Every far off movement of a bird or hare doesn\u2019t escape your notice and you feel more alive and in tune with the world around you than ever before. With the long nights returns the restlessness and you resume the catnaps during midday.\n\nWhere the track you\u2019ve been following veers alongside another, you peer down the slope at the great train yard you\u2019d left days ago. You\u2019ve finally made it back and can continue on with your journey into the west.\n\n\n\nYou find a garden hose curled up on the side of the first house you come upon and there\u2019s no one in sight. You refill your water jugs and take off before someone spots you. You\u2019re well stocked up again for a while at least.\n\n\n\nThe train yard looks so different in the light of day.

You study it a minute before picking up the hose a little at a time\u2014working the contents out to the end\u2014and manage to get a good mouthful of scalding hot water.

From there, you memorize the mountain peak you need to walk toward to get to that gray line and then set out to make it as far as you can before the sun gets too high.\n\nYou\u2019ve covered quite a bit of ground when you find several big boulders in a roughly circular formation and sit beneath the largest one for its shade. You manage to nap quite nicely until the sun gets far enough to the west that you have to move to a different shady spot.\n\nWhen the sun has dipped more than halfway behind the horizon, you set out to make as many miles as you can before it gets too dark to see. You feel weak from hunger and from lack of water, but your will pushes you on.\n\nAbout halfway through the night, you look up to see a tiny sliver of moon directly overhead. It\u2019s no wonder that you\u2019ve been able to keep going this long. Even with that tiny bit of light, you can see the ground quite clearly. The faint shadows contrast against the background and your eyes seem to have adjusted themselves to the lack of light.\n\nIt\u2019s warmer down here than it was last night, but the air still has that certain crispness to it. You haven\u2019t been able to see the mountain peak for hours, but are confident that you haven\u2019t strayed too much from your intended goal. You just keep pushing yourself. You are going to make it. You have no other choice.\n\nYou continue on. You\u2019ve been walking for hours and you feel like your legs are about to fall off. If you don\u2019t just collapse, that is. But, you must keep going. There will be time to rest tomorrow\u2014when it is too hot.\n\nThe stars and the moon flow gently to the west, but you don\u2019t even notice. You are too focused on putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nSuddenly, you see a straight black double line running perpendicular to your path. It looks like it might be the edge of a cliff so you approach it ever so slowly. When you\u2019re nearly upon it, you discover that it is higher than the rest of the ground around it.\n\nIt\u2019s the tracks! You\u2019ve found them! You really found them! They weren\u2019t nearly as far away as they looked. You feel great! You are KING!\n\nYou turn toward the west\u2014nearly skipping\u2014and continue on your journey. Now all you have to do is find some water and some food, then you\u2019ll be all set.\n\nYou watch as the sliver of moon finally disappears behind the black horizon and the stars start to twinkle just a tiny bit brighter. You can barely make out the rails on either side of you, but there\u2019s still more than enough light to guide you.\n\nYou trudge on and on in the darkness. It feels somehow comforting to you now. Like you might be the only person in the whole world. The cloak of night is your friend, your companion.\n\nAs the sky starts to gray, you can see farther and farther with each passing minute. There are no yard lights. No houses. No distant towns. No nothing. You feel completely alone now. It gives you a lump in your throat.\n\nThe sun is on your back now and you can feel its rays trickling warmth into your rigid skin. You can\u2019t turn around to look at it. You have to save every last bit of your strength. You can barely lift your legs and the toes of your shoes scrub furrows in the dust. Still, you plod on.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve nearly caught up with your shadow, you scan the area for some cool shade. You see a pile of old lumber out all by its lonesome. It may have been some kind of mining shack at one time, but it\u2019s impossible to tell. It\u2019s the only thing within sight and the two vertical boards won\u2019t offer any shade for hours yet, but you can\u2019t go on. You have to get off your feet so that means you have work to do.\n\nYou stumble over and start dragging and prying boards from the ground as best you can. It takes some doing since half of them are buried in sand. You are just pulling up the last one when you see something shiny under it. You drop the board as you jump back thinking at first that it might be a snake. It couldn\u2019t be, though, it didn\u2019t even resemble anything that could even be alive.\n\nSticking another board under the one you dropped so you don\u2019t have to stick your bare hand in there, you pry it up. It takes a moment for the sun\u2019s glare to clear from your eyes and then you see a magical treasure. It is a half-crushed tin cup that is about a third full of old water. It is dark and has a funny smell to it, but it\u2019s wet.

It\u2019s more of a lean-to than anything, but at least there\u2019s shade.\n\nYou get down on all fours and crawl through a narrow opening at the bottom. The ground is still hot and could possibly blister if you dally. Once inside, you scoop handful after handful off the top and shove it against the sides at the bottom. It\u2019ll help hold them up as well as give you a faintly cooler spot to lay down.\n\nSlumping over, something bites your little finger. It stings a little, but nothing serious. You push yourself back up and see a tiny scorpion right where your hand was so you slam your fist down on it and crush it before it can strike again.

This just isn\u2019t going to be your day. You close your eyes and try to take in deep breaths, but hot air you suck in with each one just makes you feel that much worse.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, you open your eyes and between the vertical planks you can see the light fading from the sky. There are reds and oranges and pinks. Even through the slits, it is breathtaking. You only wish you could walk out to see the whole thing.\n\nYou can barely move your head and it\u2019s impossible to move the rest of you. You can\u2019t take this anymore, but what choice do you have? You can only sit here to wait for the inevitable. Too bad you don\u2019t have a blanket, because it is getting so, so cold. Your teeth would chatter if you only had the energy to do so.\n\nThe sky deepens and you can see the first twinkle of a star. You should make a wish. But, it\u2019s much too late for that. You know it as sure as you know anything at all. All you have left waiting for you is the inevitable.\n\nMaybe if you made the right wish, it might come true. You can\u2019t close your eyes to make the wish or you may never get them open again. You take a long, hard swallow and feel the sides of your throat scratch together.\n\nYou focus hard on the star until you can feel it pulling back at you. You try to mouth the words, but you don\u2019t have the strength. Willing with everything you have\u2014everything you are\u2014you send your wish soaring toward that tiny pinprick of a speck\u2014faster than the speed of light.\n\nJane steps from the corner of your little makeshift shelter.

There are reds and oranges and pinks. Even through the slits, it is breathtaking.\n\nYou scurry back through the hole in the boards and see the tapestry of the western sky in all its glory. The sun has already set, but has left an explosion of color in its wake. You stand there a moment in awe before setting off down the tracks once more.\n\nYou walk through the night taking frequent rest breaks to rub away the burning cramps in your legs and once, you have to move away from the tracks and go prone when a freight roars through. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to make it much farther if you don\u2019t find drinkable water soon.\n\nWhen the sun starts to peek its head, you scan the barren landscape looking for both water and another daytime shelter. It\u2019s already getting too hot for comfort. Up ahead a couple of miles, you see a string of hoppers sitting off on a siding near the foot of a small mountain. They won\u2019t offer much, but at least it\u2019s shade. You quicken your pace despite your toes attempting to curl themselves in under your feet.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of shade under the hoppers when you reach them, but already they are giving off more heat than would be comfortable. You do spot a dusty brown prickly pear patch off toward the mountain so it\u2019s a good thing you decided to stop early in the day. It seems like so long ago when Harvey first showed you that you could eat it. You\u2019ll just have to be really careful when you pick and skin it since you lost your knife.\n\nYou rush over and fall to your knees and start to carefully pluck one of the leafy pads. The tiny spines prick at your fingers so you take extra time to be even more careful. When you have it in your hands, you dig the skin off of it with your thumbnail. The moisture runs down and drips off your hand. You greedily lap up the sweet juice as you continue digging away the skin and spines. When you have enough exposed you take a bite and the sweet flavor explodes in your mouth. It doesn\u2019t taste bland at all. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s later in the year and maybe more ripe or maybe it\u2019s just because you haven\u2019t eaten or had anything to drink in days.\n\nAfter three pads, you can\u2019t hold any more but you continue chewing up bite after bite to get at the juice. While you\u2019re gorging yourself, you see a deep shadow at the base of the mountain that looks like it has a door in it. Weird. Who would put a door in a mountain?\n\nYou push yourself to your feet and stumble over to the shadow and see that it\u2019s not really a door, but a boarded up hole. A cool draft hits you right square in the face. You have to get in there! At the bottom and under a faded sign that has slipped it\u2019s nail, there\u2019s a gap just big enough for you wriggle your way through if you swing the sign aside. It reminds you of the night you and Jane went into that spooky old house.\n\nC\u2019mon, I know the way in.\n\nW-wait. What if something\u2019s in there? What if someone catches us?\n\nDon\u2019t worry. No one ever comes here. This place is \u2018bandoned.\n\nIt seems so long ago and in a place you can barely remember and to a boy who no longer exists. Maybe even in another life, perhaps.\n\nYou squat down and hold the sign up with one hand as you work your way inside. Sand sifts down on you as you pass through the opening\u2014but only a little. From somewhere deep in the bowels of the cave, you can hear water dripping into a pool. Too bad it isn\u2019t outside. It\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been swimming. It\u2019d be a nice way to cool off.\n\nSitting just far enough inside that you\u2019re out of the direct sunlight, you lean back to soak up the cool, damp air. Your stomach rumbles and cramps up, but you barely notice as you fall fast asleep.\n\n\n\nYou wake up shivering and crawl back into the blast furnace through the little gap. You have a vague recollection of an eerie yawning groan having disturbed your sleep, but it quickly fades into the ether along with the dream that inspired it. You head back over to the prickly pear patch and perform your routine again. It\u2019ll take some time before you are back to one-hundred percent. Right now, you aren\u2019t even considering leaving this wonderful place.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill again, you crawl back into your hidey-hole. You have to crawl in a little deeper since the sun is at a lower angle and its rays stretch in nearly twice as far. It\u2019s not that you mind sleeping in the daytime so much, you just don\u2019t want those burning fingers on your skin.\n\nYou see a lump over against the far wall and have to investigate what it might be. You carefully creep over in case it might be an animal\u2014even though by its shape, it couldn\u2019t possibly be. You reach out with the toe of your shoe and give it a light nudge. It teeters to one side and comes back to rest in the same place with a tinny sound that reverberates off the walls. You immediately know what this object is. It\u2019s a bucket!\n\nIf you can find the source of that dripping sound, you could have all the water you\u2019d need for a couple days and surely you\u2019d run into more by the time it is empty.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to find the source", "result": "Crawling slowly through the dark on your knees and feeling ahead of you with one hand while dragging the pail with the other, you make your way deep into the cave. The sound gets gradually louder the deeper you go until you feel spatter hit your face. It\u2019s coming from the wall from drips overhead, but the sound of the pool is still far away so you continue on.\n\nThe ground is damp for quite a ways before it starts getting dry again. It doesn\u2019t appear that the sound is getting any closer. If you don\u2019t find it soon, you might as well turn back. You don\u2019t want to get lost in this cave. You might not be able to find your way back.\n\nThe floor keeps rising steadily and turns from sand to rock. It slopes up steeply and you have trouble holding on enough while climbing with only one free hand. You\u2019ve come just about as far as you dare. You try to determine how much farther the sound of the pool is and in what direction, but the echo off the rocks makes it sound like it\u2019s coming from everywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s no use. You shimmy back down the rock and start making your way back. You can feel eyes on you from the darkness, but can\u2019t tell from which direction. One way is as black as another. The only thing you can see is tiny white flashes at the edge of your vision.\n\nYou reach the damp sand again and have just started across it when the ground under you starts shifting forward. You twist around and try to scramble back, but it\u2019s moving too swift and you\u2019re losing more ground than you gain. Then suddenly, you are in open air and tumbling head over feet. The fall seems to take forever. It\u2019s only seconds, but time has slowed down for you.\n\n\u201cAAAAHH!\u201d\n\n\u201cAaaAaaAaaahh!\u201d your echo screams back at you.\n\nYou hit the water head first. You frantically paddle for the surface. There is absolutely no light so can\u2019t tell which way is up. Your lungs are empty and you fight to not let the water in.\n\nFinally, you break the surface and tread water as best as you can, but you don\u2019t have the strength to last long. It dawns on you that you still have the bucket so you flip it upside-down\u2014letting the water spill out and catch some air\u2014to use as a float.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve finally caught your breath, you kick and paddle over to a slimy and slick wall. There are no handholds so you slowly move along looking for something to grab onto.\n\nYou come to a ledge that is right at water level and slowly work your way up onto it. When you\u2019re finally seated, you place the bucket beside you and take slow even breaths to slow your racing heart. That was way too close. You stand up and search the slimy wall and find nothing as far up as you can reach. You move from one end to the other and find nothing but the same.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve regained your strength, you slip back into the water and\u2014holding onto the bucket\u2014start feeling around some more as you make your way around the pool. You make it back to the same ledge before long.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been sitting here. Hours? Days? Weeks? It doesn\u2019t matter. It wasn\u2019t long before you couldn\u2019t feel your legs. Then your arms wouldn\u2019t work anymore. You can\u2019t even tell if your eyes are open or closed at this point.\n\nOut in the middle of the blackness, you see a shimmering speck of light that grows and grows until it finally takes shape. It\u2019s that dark haired girl with that mischievous grin. Her toes barely skim the water as she glides softly over to you. She reaches down and cups her hand over yours as she looks deeply into your eyes with those bright green eyes.\n\nYou manage to mouth a word, but does it really escape your lips?\n\n\u201cJane\u201d your echo whispers back.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The End", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Continue on your way", "result": "You carry the bucket back with you into the light and examine it for holes.

You manage to squeeze your way back outside and a warm, stiff breeze ripples its fingers over your skin and through your hair. It feels rather pleasant after being in the cool for so long.\n\nWith bucket in hand, you stroll over to the prickly pears and begin carefully filling it with the pads that you don\u2019t immediately eat. There\u2019s not much left of the patch when you get done with it.\n\nYou look over your shoulder to see that the moon is more than a sliver and just a might above the horizon behind you. You decide that you might as well continue on since there\u2019s no point in staying in one place for too long.\n\nYou pick yourself up, dust yourself off and set off down the tracks again. There are faint shadows outlining each railroad tie and you can see the wispy shapes of gravel off to the sides. There is a bluish tint to the desert where it fades into nothingness only a stones throw to each side.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stop to rest nearly as often and when you do, you carefully peel bits of prickly pear and suck out the juice. You\u2019ve got enough to last you for days as long as you don\u2019t get too piggish with it. And now that you\u2019ve found out how magical it is, you\u2019ll keep an eye out for patches so you can keep your bucket as full of it as you can.\n\nOnce in the night, you have to get away from the tracks and go prone when an East-bound freight rumbles through. It must be miles and miles long with six roaring engines straining to keep it moving. It\u2019s too dark to make out the cargo, but it has to be really something special. You long to be on it heading back to familiar territory, but what magical things it must have seen before reaching this point. Even after it passes out of sight and then hearing, you can still feel its vibrations in the tracks.\n\nThe moon drifts by overhead\u2014dragging the stars in its wake. You take the ties two at a time until the bottoms of your feet are so puffy that you have to slow to every one. The dark silhouettes of the mountains to your right take form as they rip free of the night sky and go from black to red to gold before you turn around and see the sun spilling over the horizon to your rear. It is a most awe inspiring sight of reds and oranges and golds fading into lavender at its fringes.\n\nYou scan the barren landscape around you and spot a tiny twinkle far up ahead. Maybe it\u2019s something and maybe it\u2019s not, but the tracks will come close enough to it that you\u2019re going to find out. The landscape is sparsely dotted with bluish-green lumps and by their shape you can tell that they are prickly pear patches. They are everywhere! There\u2019s so much that you\u2019ll never go hungry or thirsty again! You\u2019ll just grab what you need from the patches when they come close to the tracks to keep your bucket full.\n\nThere is a sudden explosion all around you and your heart skips a couple of beats when a dozen or so tiny pigs shoot out in all directions from their dusty wallows surprised by your sudden appearance. Even the grown ones are no bigger than a dog. It takes you a moment for your blood to settle enough that you can keep walking.\n\nAfter you go a little farther, you are close enough to see what the thing is that is twinkling. It\u2019s a windmill out all by itself. The shiny fan blades are high enough off the ground that they catch a ripple every now and then, but the tail fin is broken and bent sideways so it can no longer face into the wind. Did there used to be a farmhouse near it and now it\u2019s gone? Maybe there\u2019s still some stuff laying around it. You pick up your pace in the hopes of finding something salvageable.\n\nFrom somewhere not too far off toward the mountains, you hear a sound like someone screaming with rage. Your hair stands on end and you freeze in your steps. You carefully scan the area and see nothing but a barren, sand-colored landscape dotted with the occasional boulder, cactus or prickly pear patch. Everything is eerily still.\n\nYou take a tentative step down the tracks while keeping a wary eye on the desert. Something is out there, but you don\u2019t have a clue what it might be. A ghost, maybe? Or some madman? You are poised to run at the first sign of movement.\n\nBefore long, you are adjacent to the windmill and\u2014after taking a last, long look around\u2014head down the gravel embankment toward it. You see a long galvanized water trough\u2014a little bigger than the bathtub you had in your old house before your mom and dad got a divorce\u2014a short distance from its base connected to a rusty tank via a short, bent pipe. Maybe there will be enough water to soak in and cool off before the sun creeps high enough to scorch the day.\n\nWhen you get up to the tank, you see about an inch of water in the bottom. You could still use it to cool off in and rinse away several layers of dirt and dust that you\u2019ve picked up since the last time you bathed so you strip down to your altogethers and dip your toe in. The water is a bit warm now even though it\u2019s still early in the day, but not so much that you can\u2019t stand it and when you climb back out the gentle breeze should take care of the rest.\n\nYou sit down and start dipping water with your hands and pouring it over your head. It feels so good on your bare skin as you rub away the grit and dust. You haven\u2019t had a bath in a long, long time so you make the most if it.\n\nYou lean back and bask in the sun for a few minutes soaking everything up and notice a metal latter going up the side of the windmill. There\u2019s no telling what you\u2019d be able to see from up there. As soon as you\u2019ve dried off, you want to climb it and have a good look around. There\u2019s nothing on the ground here for as far as you can see. Why would anyone put a windmill out in the middle of nowhere? There\u2019s not even a fence to keep in animals if that\u2019s what it\u2019s for.\n\nYou stand up and are reaching over the side for your clothes when you hear that scream again from much closer this time. Your blood runs cold. You whip your head around toward the tracks and the direction it came from. There on the ridge, you see a big tan cat just like the one you saw when you were with Sam only this one isn\u2019t quite as big even though it is twice as scary.\n\nBefore it heads down the slope toward you you are already climbing up the tower. When you reach the top, you look back over your shoulder to see it circling below and looking up at you. You look over and see an old paint can full of bolts and heavy, rusty adjustable wrench which you can use as a nice weapon. As long as it can\u2019t figure out how to use the ladder, you are safe since there\u2019s no way it could climb the metal legs. You pick up the wrench and slap it against your palm. If it does manage to climb the ladder, you\u2019re ready to smash its head and paws as soon as it gets within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nIts eyes are fixed on yours and its ears are laid back when it makes a tremendous leap. You stagger backward and manage to grab onto one of the center posts that angle to the ground at the very last second while you are teetering and flailing your arms. The cat can jump much higher than you expected, but still only came a little over halfway to the top. After a couple more attempts with no more success than it had the first time, it stalks around and swats your bucket through the air\u2014sending its contents spraying out in a wide arc.\n\n\u201cGo away! Leave me alone!\u201d\n\nYou grab a hand full of bolts and start pelting the ground around him with the tiny missiles. Only one manages to hit its mark and the cat only flicks its shoulder muscle in response.\n\nThe cat pays no mind to your words and only continues pacing around the tower while staring up at you. There\u2019s really nothing you can do but wait it out and hope it gets interested in something else or bored enough that it forgets all about you and leaves. You sit down with your back against the center post and keep a watchful eye on the cat below in case it figures out how to use the ladder.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the big cat moves over to opposite side of the storage tank from the trough and lays down in the sliver of shade it provides. It\u2019s only going to get hotter up here as the sun gets higher and higher. You have no choice but to suffer through it. There is a decent breeze up here that the cat doesn\u2019t have. Maybe it\u2019ll be enough.\n\nYou lean your head back against the post and close your eyes, but only to slits because you don\u2019t want that thing to get out of your sight. It yawns and does the same, but doesn\u2019t lay its head down. From here on in it\u2019s just going to be a waiting game.", "action_results": [{"action": "Life happens", "result": "Hours have passed when you hear a low rumble coming from behind you.

It was an accident.\u201d\n\nHe stands there scratching above his ear for a moment before shaking his head and turning toward the windmill.\n\nYou rush over and jerk on your clothes while he climbs it. Then you start putting the all the prickly pears you can find back in your bucket and look up to see him fixing the tail. You can\u2019t help but stand there until he\u2019s finished just to see if it works.

When school time rolls around, he enrolls you under his name and after talking to a judge friend of his and telling him your story, it\u2019s all made nice and legal. It isn\u2019t long before you feel like you belong at this ranch.\n\nOne day when you\u2019re fourteen and he can barely get around even with the aid of his cane, you and he are out setting the windmill where you first met. He turns to you and says \u201cI never had a son of my own. It\u2019s lucky for me that you dropped into my lap like you did. You\u2019re a damn fine worker and a fine young man. Someday I\u2019ll be gone and all this will belong to you.\u201d\n\nYou smile at him and give him a firm squeeze on the shoulder. Isn\u2019t it funny how life turns out sometimes, you think.

All that she\u2014and you, no doubt\u2014could convey was sadness and a sense of hopelessness of the situation.\n\nYou sit slumped\u2014craning your neck to peek through the patrol car\u2019s rear window\u2014and watch as the officer who ran you and Jane out of the abandoned house a couple nights ago turns away from Jane and her mother, and walks back to the car. No sooner than his back is turned does she turn and shove Jane inside the house, slamming the door shut behind her.\n\nThe officer throws a glance over his shoulder, but doesn\u2019t break stride as he continues on his way.\n\nAfter he closes his car door, you say \u201cIs she gonna hit Jane?\u201d\n\nHe turns sideways in his seat and looks back at you. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s not able to sit down for a week after pulling a stunt like this. Do you understand how dangerous it was for the two of you out there all alone? We\u2019re lucky that we found you before something bad happened to you. You don\u2019t know what some people are capable of doing to children.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hates Jane. I don\u2019t want her to hit her anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo mother hates her own child. She\u2019s just having a rough time raising her on her own\u2014being a single mother and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen. I\u2019ll swing back by after I drop you off and look in on her, okay?\u201d He starts the engine and pulls it into gear. \u201cEverything will be back to normal as soon as this mess blows over.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs you pull into the drive, the door opens and your mom steps out on the porch. She rushes over to the patrol car and snatches you by the arm\u2014dragging you out and pulling you close\u2014as soon as the policeman opens the rear door.\n\n\u201cHere he is, safe and sound. No one knows how those two managed to make it so far away on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a handful. I can barely keep up with him most of the time. An\u2019 with this new job, I\u2019ll have to work extra hard at it, I guess,\u201d she says, flashing her eyes at you over a wan smile. \u201cI\u2019m just glad he\u2019s home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, ma\u2019am. Glad to be of service.\u201d\n\nHe walks with you to the door of the garage and watches as the two of you step inside.\n\n\u201cThanks again, Officer,\u201d your mom says, ushering you in and closing the door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome,\u201d he says, turning around and walking back the way he came.\n\nShe lifts the corner of the vinyl curtain to watch him get into his patrol car and pull out of the driveway. When she turns around to you, her face is a deep shade of red and skewed beyond all recognition.\n\n\u201cIf things are so bad here that you felt the need to run away, then why didn\u2019t you just stay gone!?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have an answer. You take a step to the rear as she lifts the solid metal rod from the window and yanks it free of the curtain.\n\nShe is on you before you even know it\u2014whipping you side to side like a terrier does a rat by a handful of hair in one hand while she whacks at your butt and the back of your legs with the curtain rod in the other. Every so often, an errant strike lands in the small of your back and your vision momentarily goes black. You can feel it cut deep and glance off bone with each blow.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you do anything right? Why do you always have to go out of your way to make me mad?\u201d\n\nYou try to lessen the blows by deflecting them with your palms, but it only forces her to swing harder. The flesh on the underside of your hands soon feels tight and swollen, and you no longer have control enough to maneuver them into a position of any benefit at all.\n\nAll you can do is grit your teeth and bear the pain. If you make even the slightest sound of whimpering, she\u2019ll \u201cgive you something to really cry about\u201d.\n\nThe stinging pain finally lessens as your vision fades and grows more and more distant as the world goes dark around you.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been lying here in the darkness. Your whole body throbs from one end to the other and you want nothing more than to return to sleep.\n\nWhat about Jane? She was right. You and she need to just run away together and find her Gramma or else somebody nice to take care of the two of you. You don\u2019t have a choice anymore. You know that now. Your mom will end up killing you if you don\u2019t get away.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes. You drag your arms under you and shove yourself to your knees.\n\nYou see no sign of your mom and can only guess that she has gone back to the party in Honey\u2019s house.\n\nYou pick yourself up off the floor. You can\u2019t straighten your legs and your back is in an uncontrollable hunch, but you manage to maintain your balance and not topple over despite the impossible angle you are leaning.\n\nOne determined step after another, you make your way to the door.\n\nThe curtain is now back in its place over the window. You look at it for what seems like a long time debating whether or not to do something about that impromptu weapon. It would do absolutely no good, though, because she\u2019d just grab something else to use on you the next time.\n\nYou reach out and grip the knob with all the strength you can muster. It doesn\u2019t give easily, but you manage to turn it enough that the latch lets go. You hobble on one foot through the open doorway into the bright afternoon sun and pull the door closed behind you.\n\nYou can hear music coming from Honey\u2019s house, but don\u2019t see any movement through the windows. You limp around the garage and through the back yard to the alley.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about mid-afternoon by the time you reach Jane\u2019s house. The place looks closed up tight. After calling into the \u201csecret place\u201d and getting no response, you amble up to the front door and rap on it several times with the same result.\n\nWhere could she be?", "action_results": [null, null]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, null]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Find a better way", "result": "The only adult you see is the woman reading on the park bench so you run up to her.\n\n\u201cPlease help that girl\u201d you say, pointing toward the group.\n\nShe looks clearly agitated as she lifts her eyes up at you and slowly turns her head toward them, but crinkles her nose and goes right back to her stupid book.\n\nYou have no choice now but to come up with something on your own.\n\nLooking around for a club of some kind, you notice a bunch of rocks. You quickly grab up a handful and find you a nice spot behind a tree not too far from them.\n\n\u201cGet away from her!\u201d\n\nThe boys look over and spot you.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d demands Snots.\n\n\u201cJust let her go!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr what?\u201d asks Tubby as he takes a step toward you.\n\nChortle grapples the girl as Snots trots up beside Tubby.\n\n\u201cAre you here to rescue her? Is she your girlfriend?\u201d Tubby jeers.\n\nYou feel your face flush with anger. \u201cJust leave her alone,\u201d you say, taking a step to the rear and letting your hand drop back.\n\n\u201cLook here, this guy\u2019s here to save his bastard girlfriend,\u201d spits Snots.\n\nYou flash red and send a rock sailing right at his little smart mouth. He manages to turn his head just in time and the rock bounces off the side of his face. He falls back in horror and starts tearing up.\n\nTubby lunges toward you, but you side-step and he misses you by several feet, flailing his arms to keep his balance. You ready another rock as he spins back toward you.\n\n\u201cWanna be a tough guy, huh?\u201d\n\nHe comes at you again like a raging bull\u2014nostrils flaring and all. You chuck the rock at him. It bounces off his chest and he keeps coming without losing a step.\n\nYou dodge sideways, but his hand still clobbers your face as he continues past.\n\nThe girl manages to land one of her backward kicks and Chortle falls like a sack of potatoes, screaming in agony as his face goes purple. She turns and darts between two houses on the far side of the street.\n\n\u201cGet her,\u201d wheezes Chortle, \u201cGet that little bastard!\u201d\n\nSnots runs to his aid and tries to pull him to his feet between sobs, but can\u2019t muster the strength. Chortle is in no condition to stand just yet anyhow.\n\nYou run.\n\nWhen you feel like you are far enough away, you look back to see that Tubby has gone back to his friends. You dash between houses and start making your way back toward where the girl went through.\n\nThe alley is shrouded by trees arching overhead and you make your way to the end of it. Seeing no sign of her, you cut through to the next street. Still nothing. She\u2019s long gone.\n\nYou suddenly remember the bag tucked under the picnic table that you were supposed to be watching. If something happened to it, you\u2019ll be in big trouble.\n\nYou sprint like the devil is after you. A hedge claws up your arms and face as you dart through it, which you barely even notice.\n\nTurning down the alley, a dark figure steps out from behind the corner of the hedge directly in your path. Your mouth goes all coppery and dry, and you skid to a stop.\n\nYou\u2019re all set to flee when you realize that it\u2019s the girl from before. She looks sheepish and a bit winded, but no worse for wear.\n\nShe hangs her head, but her eyes remain fixed on yours. As you cautiously approach her, you detect the faint hint of a smile.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she barely more than whispers.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYeah. They didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure hurt that one.\u201d\n\nShe chuckles.\n\n\u201cWho were them boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust some boys from school. They always pick on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust \u2018cause. They\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you ask, scrunching your toes and noticing how dirty they\u2019ve gotten.\n\n\u201cJane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cBilly. We just moved here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, turning her gaze to the side, then back to you. \u201cMy house is on Hill Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that is. We just got here last night. We came in on the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d she points over your shoulder, \u201con the edge of town. C\u2019mon. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now. I have to watch our stuff so Mom can find a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d After a pause, she asks \u201cWhat grade are you in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in Second this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too. Maybe we can sit together.\u201d\n\nThe very suggestion makes you feel queasy and uncomfortable. \u201cI better get back before she comes back,\u201d you say stepping past her.\n\n\u201cOkay. See ya later.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee ya later.\u201d\n\nYou cut between two houses following their shared ribbon driveway. As you get to the front, you peek down the street and see that the gang is gone.\n\nThe park is empty now with no one in sight. You cross the street and see that the bag is still right where it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nYou climb the cement picnic table and plop down on top of it with your feet on the bench. All you can do now is wait.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}
