A couple of dubious individuals peep their heads out\n\n\u201cHere we are, let me do all the talking.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\n\u201cJust stand there and look pretty as usual.\u201d\n\nAs you follow Kelly into the warehouse the two men who you saw earlier stand armed as another fatter man comes to greet you both.\n\n\u201cAh Killer Kelly always a pleasure. You\u2019re here very early. I hope you haven\u2019t come to convince me that you deserved more money for that last match because I thought we had settled that, disagreement.\u201d\n\u201cNo Steve, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m here about something else. Namely my sister here.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Steve says as he eyes you up and down lustfully, making you very uncomfortable.\n\u201cShe wants a job and I figured you could help me out, us being friends and all.\u201d\n\u201cWhy of course! But surely this pretty little thing is no fighter is she?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I know you\u2019re always looking for more ring girls, and well obviously since your tongue is hanging out you believe she qualifies.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, she qualifies, but let\u2019s go to my office and discuss this in more detail.\u201d\n\nAll five of you head towards the office and every instinct in your body is telling you to get out, but then you remember your sister telling you that she\u2019ll be looking out for you. She\u2019s always been mean, but she\u2019s never lied to you.\n\nThe office isn\u2019t anything unusual and Steve continues talking with Kelly the whole time, until he sits down and begins to address you directly.\n\n\u201cSo you willing to walk around a ring holding a card for a few minutes while drunks gawk and scream at you?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\u201cYou willing to dress in a skimpy outfit that shows off those tits and that ass you\u2019ve got covered?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou willing to suck my cock?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI said are you willing to suck my cock darling? Your sister did mention that as a pre-requisite didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nYou look at Kelly in horror.\n\n\u201cHeh, well by that expression, I can see she didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cKelly! You mean you blew this guy to get this job?\u201d\n\u201cHah! I wouldn\u2019t let Kelly near my dick! She\u2019s a dyke anyway. No only ring girls get this special privilege. So let\u2019s get to it.\u201d\n\nSteve starts to unzip his pants while his two goons just smirk. Kelly\u2019s expression hasn\u2019t changed. She looks as serious as ever.\n\n\u201cKelly, I don\u2019t think I can do this\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh fuck Suzy what\u2019s the fucking problem? So you suck a little dick to get a job, it\u2019s not the end of the goddamn world! I told you before; you\u2019re going to have to get a little dirty if you want to function in the real world! DO NOT make me look like a fucking asshole right now by backing out!\u201d\n\nYou feel so scared, outnumbered and overwhelmed right now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back out", "result": "You can\u2019t do this. It goes against everything that mom instilled in you. You begin to cry and collapse on the floor in tears.\n\n\u201cOh geez, she is an emotional one. Oh well nevermind then.\u201d Steve says zipping up his pants. \u201cKelly I\u2019ll see you at tonight\u2019s show, hope you put on a good one, because combined with your complaining yesterday and wasting my time today, you\u2019re not exactly high on my list right now. Get out of here.\u201d\n\nKelly doesn\u2019t say anything but she pulls you up by the hair and roughly pulls you back to the car. She\u2019s entirely silent during this time, but when she throws you in the car, she lets loose.\n\n\u201cYou fucking little bitch! You couldn\u2019t help me out once? I told you to trust me, and you can\u2019t even do that! When we get home you better just permanently stay in that goddamn basement of yours! Don\u2019t EVER ask for my help ever again! Fuck you! Fuck you!\u201d She screams and your cries are stifled when she punches you in the face a couple times before starting up the car.\n\nShe continues to berate you and smacks you a few more times whenever you start to cry a little louder. You almost think she\u2019s going to dump you in the middle of one the ghettos you\u2019re driving through and she does threaten to do so several times, but she never does.\n\nWhen you get home, Peter and his buddy Kevin are outside filming something irrelevant, but when they see you and Kelly they film her pulling you out of the car, screaming obscenities, and kicking you a few times before driving off. Kevin helps you up and tries to grope you in the process, but you push him away and run back to your room to cry.\n\nYou attempted to do something in the real world and were literally beaten and harassed for your efforts. It\u2019s apparent to you now that you have no place out there anymore. You follow Kelly\u2019s advice this time and vow never to leave the basement ever again.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Do it", "result": "Reluctantly you agree, but definitely not because you want to, but more because you feel scared and pressured right now.\n\nTearfully you go towards Steve who begins to fondle your breasts and run his hands generally all over your body.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re nice. Don\u2019t be scared little darling. Nobody\u2019s going to hurt you here.\u201d\n\nYou get on your knees before Steve who pulls his dick out and begins stroking it, but is getting dismayed by your reluctance. At this point your sister Kelly speaks up.\n\n\u201cErm, Steve. I think this would go easier for my sister if there wasn\u2019t an audience. As you might\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s a bit on the shy side.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, whatever. All of you get out.\u201d\n\nSteve\u2019s goons look a bit disappointed, but comply. You sister leaves as well. You could swear she had a grin on her face as she was leaving.\n\n\u201cAlright sweetie, we\u2019ve wasted enough time, get to work.\u201d Steve says and shoves your face in his crotch.\n\nIt has to be one of the more awful things you\u2019ve smelt and it definitely tastes just as bad. You begin to cough.\n\n\u201cBitch you better not vomit on my dick!\u201d Steve orders, but you\u2019re having a very hard time with that order.\n\nBeing a virgin, you haven\u2019t even done this before. So you\u2019re sort of fumbling around a lot. True you\u2019ve watched porn on the internet out of curiosity and you\u2019re attempting to mimic what you remember those ladies (or guys in some cases) did, but you\u2019re just not a natural at it seems. Either that or the smell and the entire degrading situation is really distracting you.\n\nOnce again Steve begins to get agitated.\n\n\u201cChrist have you ever done this before? Here!\u201d he says and put his hands on your head and push it back and forth himself. You\u2019d probably choke on his dick with this technique if his dick wasn\u2019t so small. As it is your head is partially ramming into the flab of his gut, so you\u2019re still not getting much air.\n\nSteve continues to violate your mouth and says how much you\u2019re a whore and how you enjoy this. You absolutely don\u2019t though and the only thing you can do as the salty taste invades your mouth is close your eyes and pretend you\u2019re someplace else.\n\n\u201cSwallow you fucking whore!\u201d he shouts in ecstasy and at that point a shot is heard.\n\n\u201cAck!\u201d Steve shouts as he cums in your mouth. You gasp and gag for air and manage to break free while more cum shoots from his dick and all over your face. You immediately start spitting and throwing up in the corner, still not realizing what has happened.\n\n\u201cTeach you to cheat me, motherfucker. Now where\u2019s that safe combination?\u201d you hear your sister say.\n\nYou finally look behind you, still hacking up cum and attempting to wipe it off your face along with tears.\n\n\u201cKelly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. I told you, that I wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt you. Glad you trusted me.\u201d She says as she searches Steve who lies in a slump in his chair and a big hole in his head. \u201cHah! Knew he had the combo written down, this fucker could never remember anything.\u201d\n\nKelly gleefully proceeds to open the floor safe hidden nearby, though not too hidden since Kelly knew where it was. You on the other hand are still trying to come to grips with what just happened.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t let any one hurt me?! You let this bastard rape my mouth! And for what?\u201d\n\u201cFor this! All this lovely loot!\u201d Kelly says thrusting a wad of bills in your face, which you don\u2019t like considering that you\u2019ve had your fill of having anything thrust in your face today. You\u2019re beyond fear now and moved on to outrage and anger.\n\n\u201cFor money?! You could\u2019ve just killed him without me!\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but it would\u2019ve been much harder. He had those bodyguards with him at all times, your distraction was just what I needed.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit! You did this to me for your own twisted pleasure!\u201d\n\u201cDid I?\u201d your sister smiles. \u201cMaybe. But I also did it for the money and revenge.\n\u201cRevenge on me or him?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps both. And I didn\u2019t make you do anything. You could\u2019ve backed out. I would\u2019ve been pissed of course, but you still could\u2019ve backed out. So you took a shot in the mouth, so fucking what? I told you before that you were going to have to get a little dirty to make it in the real world. I\u2019m going to give you half of this money for helping me anyway. Buy yourself a box of mouth wash or some shit. Hell the guy\u2019s dead now, it\u2019s not even like he can brag about it. Here help me with this money.\u201d\n\nNot knowing what to do, you comply to your sister\u2019s orders again. You and her put it all in a bag and leave, but not before Kelly kicks Steve and his chair over.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a dyke you fucking asshole!\u201d she says.\n\nYou pass one of the dead guards on the way back, then another near the exit. They showed no evidence of being shot. You guess that Kelly killed them with her bare hands.\n\nKelly and you drive off and you begin to ask about the cops or any other criminals that might miss Steve.\n\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about the cops. They\u2019ll probably throw a party. Steve\u2019s just another dead criminal. No serious investigation. And as for other criminals, they\u2019ll probably throw a party too. Nobody\u2019s going to miss him. Look, I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you, but you needed a wake up call. You needed to understand that the real world is based on sacrifices. You made a sacrifice and the pay off was bigger than the sacrifice. Wish I could\u2019ve learned that lesson a lot sooner and quicker instead of putting my body through hell and waking up in pain every morning.\u201d\n\nWhile Kelly\u2019s unique \u201clesson\u201d might have a point, all it makes you feel is violated and used. All her abuse over the years doesn\u2019t even compare to this twisted little endeavor. And she wants you to be thankful? Fuck that, and fuck her. You see the gun she used to kill Steve next to her and grab it.\n\n\u201cSuzy what the fuck are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cTeaching you a lesson too, that you can\u2019t abuse people for years and get away with it!\u201d\n\nKelly is momentarily surprised, but then reverts back to calmness.\n\n\u201cIf you shoot me, you\u2019ll have a hell of a time getting back home, with two bags of stolen money, a bloody car and a dead body collapsed on the steering wheel and gas pedal.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re pulling over.\u201d\n\u201cHah! The hell I am. Nice try, but you didn\u2019t think this through. Should\u2019ve waited until we got home where you wouldn\u2019t have been at my mercy as much, though you probably would\u2019ve lost your nerve if you waited. Maybe just as we got in this car? Oh well doesn\u2019t matter you missed your opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you to pull over now!\u201d you say jamming the gun into her head.\n\u201cOhh, you ARE mad. Never seen this side of you before. Maybe you should\u2019ve been like this when Steve was shoving his little dick in your mouth. God, that had to be horrible. What a first time for a blow job eh? Well at least his fat ass wasn\u2019t laying on top of you. Give it up Suzy. You\u2019re not going to kill me. You don\u2019t have it in you to take the risk. I\u2019m being understanding right now because you\u2019ve obviously snapped from the wake up call to reality, but you continue to shove that gun at my head and I\u2019m going to be less understanding.

Peter and his buddy Kevin are outside filming something irrelevant, but when they see you and Kelly their attention is turned.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, whatcha got in the bag?\u201d Kevin says while attempting to touch you. You\u2019re in no mood for his antics and you swing the bag of cash into his head. He falls to the ground and you proceed to pistol whip the shit out of him.\n\n\u201cHoly shit!

In some ways you can see why Ben gave up his potentially lucrative job in the government for her.

Where did he go?\u201d\n\u201cOh he\u2019s working on his underground bunker as always. He really gets caught up in it; though I try to tell him that it\u2019s completely unnecessary, but I understand his intentions to protect all of us are good. It is my hope that he will someday come to his senses and we will leave this place. The aura and karma here are\u2026well very fucked up.\u201d\n\nNever having been in Ben\u2019s bunker you ask where it is.\n\n\u201cDunno, he hides it really well and keeps switching the entrance.

You look around and notice the blue colored flowers near the medium sized trees in your backyard and you start to wonder.\n\nYou leave Tommy to his retard seizure and head over to one of the trees and knock on it. Sounds solid, you knock on the other one and it makes a completely different sound.\n\n\u201cHah! Hollow!\u201d you say and feel around for a door of some sort, eventually you find one and when you open it up a long ladder leading down is revealed.

It really doesn\u2019t seem possible, unless Moon Shadow and Tommy were initially lying to you.\n\nYou descend down the ladder. It takes awhile, but when you get to the bottom you find yourself in a fairly spartan room with a few dim lights and a generator. There\u2019s only one corridor leading from the room so you follow it.\n\n\u201cBen? Are you down here? Don\u2019t shoot if you are, it\u2019s me Suzy!\u201d you call out, walking down the corridor.\n\nYou pass many smaller room, most are empty. Some have things like canned food in them. You marvel at the fact that Ben was able to build something like this within a relatively short period of time. Amazing still that nobody really paid much attention to what he was doing or how he even got the materials down here.\n\nEventually you come to a spot where the bunker doesn\u2019t have the wall siding and just dirt with wooden support beams are being used. You\u2019re guessing that Ben\u2019s only just started digging here. You also notice that the newly dug pathway is sloping downward and there isn\u2019t any lighting in that direction. This was creepy before, but now it\u2019s starting to approach the scary realm. You decide you don\u2019t really want to go any further.\n\n\u201cBEN?! Are you down there?\u201d\n\nYour call is followed by silence for a moment, then you hear some shuffling, then heavy breathing. Whatever it is that\u2019s approaching, it doesn\u2019t sound like Ben and when a disgusting figure dripping with ichor steps into the dim light, you know damn well it isn\u2019t Ben!\n\nPanic and fear overwhelm you, and you run screaming back to the ladder. The inhuman noises are only getting louder though. You completely freak out when you run into a figure that steps out from one of the side rooms. You\u2019re temporarily blinded by the powerful light shining from where the figure\u2019s head would be. The figure turns down the light and you can see that it\u2019s Ben wearing light mounted helmet.\n\n\u201cSuzy, what the fuck are you doing down here? Get out of the way!\u201d Ben shouts and strides past you with a shotgun when he hears the noises behind you.\n\nYou crawl into the room he just came out of and hear him shout \u201cDIE FUCKING MUTANT BASTARD!\u201d, followed by a couple of gunshots a hideous cry and a loud thump.\n\nBen then returns to find you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you\u2019re still here? You\u2019ve should\u2019ve kept running, it\u2019s not safe down here.\u201d Ben asks helping you up.\n\u201cW\u2026what\u2019s going on down here?\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing much except trying to clean out some sort of race of creatures. I dunno what the hell they are, but I call \u2018em Chulocks. Y\u2019know like a combination of a Morlock and a Chud heh heh.\u201d\n\nYou have so many questions that you don\u2019t know where to begin. Ben touches some sort of panel on the wall with his shotgun and a secret door slides open and motions you inside a nicely furnished room with a large arsenal, computer, books, bed and some food.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Chulocks, we\u2019re safe in here, though I really need to install a security camera system down here. Just haven\u2019t had time. I Look Suzy, I\u2019m sure have a shitload of questions, and I\u2019ll try to answer some of them, but you\u2019ll have to leave soon.

What were doing do here anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I was going to ask you for job advice.\u201d\n\u201cJob?\u201d Ben starts to laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have any good advice since I gave up that life long ago. You still living in the basement?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, you might want to think about moving or at least sleeping with a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell as you can see living underground around here isn\u2019t exactly the safest thing. Now I doubt if these things will be crawling into the basement anytime soon, but still it\u2019s something to think about. Ironic that I built this place to be safe and it turns out to be almost as dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost? Why the hell are you still living down here?\u201d\n\u201cYou might as why as why am I still living in America. Because it\u2019s my home and I\u2019m not going to be run off by some underground mutants or ancient race, or whatever the hell those things are. Besides I got a theory they\u2019re government made anyway. Probably some sort of experiment that went wrong, or maybe even unleashed on me purposely. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure if that is the case, but given that you saw one of these things, Ben\u2019s conspiracy theories might not all be crazy.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been fighting these things?\u201d\n\u201cQuite awhile. I first ran into them about a year after I started digging this thing. Little did I know something else was digging UP. There were shitloads of them in the past. Nowadays not so much. I dunno if it\u2019s because I\u2019m killing them all off or they\u2019re finally getting the idea of not to come around here. For awhile I thought I\u2019d killed them all, and I even had Tommy come down here to help me sometimes, but as it turned out they weren\u2019t all gone and I sent Tommy back up. He\u2019s seen them, and is scared of them, but I know his attention span isn\u2019t the greatest.\u201d\n\u201cSo, wait does Moon Shadow know about this? Does anyone else?\u201d\n\u201cMoon Shadow, well if you\u2019ve spoken with her, she\u2019d probably try to make friends with the damn things. So no she doesn\u2019t know. Everyone else in the family doesn\u2019t know either. They\u2019re all too wrapped up in their own dramas and wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told them. Well Uncle Ed might, but he\u2019s up to his own suspicious dealings and quite frankly I think a Chulock eating him wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing. He\u2019s just plain creepy.\u201d\n\nThis all seems very surreal to you. All you did was want a little job advice to do something with your life and you got wrapped up in something much more.\n\nQuestion is now, are you going to actively do anything about what you learned?", "action_results": [{"action": "No", "result": "This definitely isn\u2019t for you. You want to be out of here as quickly as possible. Ben certainly understands.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you, but like I said before you really should think about changing locations of where you sleep or move out entirely. This place was never the healthiest of environments\u2026eh, I\u2019m not going to tell you what you should do with your life, but take this pistol at least. Hell, given our family\u2019s dysfunction you should have one anyway. Take care okay?\u201d\n\nYou take the gun and make your way back up the ladder and out the bunker. Moon Shadow and Tommy are now both sleeping near the garden. You pass them and head back to the basement half expecting to be attacked, but of course that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nYou don\u2019t sleep much for the next few days and when you do its on the living room sofa, which means you have to endure Kelly\u2019s insults, but nothing worse than that. (She does notice that you carry a pistol around now though) Out of curiosity you go back to the tree with the secret entrance only to find it doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nTime passes and Ben comes up to the surface every once in awhile as usual, and you talk more in depth about things. Namely the \u201cunderworld\u201d. He\u2019s convinced more than ever that the government has something to do with them.\n\nEventually he says he has everything he needs down there now, and doesn\u2019t expect to come to the surface again. He tells Moon Shadow to take Tommy away and go some place else for he cannot be the soul mate or father that is needed. He also tells you again that you should leave with them and hands you a bunch of money. He says it\u2019s the last of his life savings from his \u201cold life\u201d.\n\nYou can\u2019t see any reason to really stay. You\u2019ve been on edge ever since you found out about the Chulocks, and you were looking for something to do with your life.\n\nSaying goodbye to Ben one last time, you, Moon Shadow, and Tommy move on to parts unknown where an unknown future awaits. But hopefully it won\u2019t involve Chulocks.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Yes", "result": "You were looking for something to do with your life, and you\u2019ve come this far so\u2026\n\n\u201cBen do you need some help fighting these things?\u201d\n\nBen is taken back\n\n\u201cAre you serious? Suzy, while I appreciate your willingness to help, I think this is a bit much for you. Maybe if you were Kelly it would be a different story. You don\u2019t think Kelly would believe you if you told them what was going on down here do you?\u201d\n\nThe pair of you laugh a little at that silly question.\n\n\u201cBen why don\u2019t you just drag the bodies of one of them up here and show everyone?\u201d\n\u201cI thought about that, except it\u2019s the damnedest thing. They fucking dissolve shortly after they get killed. I thought about catching one alive, but I doubt if I could do it myself and how am I going to drag one of those heavy things up a ladder while it\u2019s kicking, biting, clawing and screeching at me in a net?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026how about Peter?\u201d\n\u201cPeter? What the hell is he going to do? Dress up in lingerie and be bait?\u201d\n\nYou laugh again.\n\n\u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t in my clothes he can, but you are aware of his film aspirations aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno I haven\u2019t seen him lately, the last thing I remember was him playing with dolls.\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s been in love with filming every little thing he sees lately. Seems like he\u2019d help film something like this so there was proof. I mean I suppose we could do it without him, but I figure he\u2019s got some better connections, us being recluses and all.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, maybe. Alright, get him down here. I won\u2019t change the entrance again for awhile.\u201d\n\nYou leave the bunker and go to Peter who is predictably filming unimportant shit around the house. Kevin thankfully seems to be in a corner nodding out from his recent heroin fix.\n\nPeter is surprisingly difficult to drag back to the bunker. He scoffs at the idea that you know what would be good material to record. But after promising him some of your pink underwear with the hearts on them, he agrees.\n\nYou and Peter head back to the bunker where Ben is in full battle mode. He tells you and Peter to stay behind him the whole time.\n\nYou follow Ben into the lower tunnel where more of those Chulocks are. The noise Ben makes attract them.\n\nPeter is dumbstruck by what he sees through his camera and records the whole gruesome incident.\n\nAfterwards Peter shows the whole family the tape and unfortunately almost no one wants to help. Uncle Ed is intrigued, but says he needs to be moving on with other things and wishes you luck. Donna is terrified and runs away from home. Moonshadow doesn\u2019t approve of your willingness to destroy living beings and also leaves with Tommy.\n\nAs for Dad he\u2019s so drunk he just thinks you guys are watching a horror movie.\n\nFortunately Kelly who practically sees herself as one of the \u201cdefenders\u201d of the McCray household is willing to help out and you all take the fight to the Chulocks.\n\nAll goes well for awhile. The family that\u2019s left is focused on goal of battling the Chulocks. It\u2019s probably the closest all of you have been in\u2026.well ever.\n\nThe problem lies with the arrangement. Ben is still doing most of fighting. Kelly is still the main bread winner of the house and as such can\u2019t really do any fighting (Indeed she does enough of that at her jobs!) Peter is almost more of a hindrance. He\u2019s so eager to get more footage of the creatures; Ben has to bail his ass out most of the time. As for you, well you try, and you do alright, but ultimately it\u2019s going to take more people to wipe out all the Chulocks as the deeper you go the more of them there are and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an end to them.\n\nThen it all starts to break down. You begin to suggest reinforcing the bunker with thick concrete and steel so that the Chulocks can\u2019t enter anymore. You figure that they\u2019ll probably dig elsewhere for better picking. Ben argues that you need to exterminate all of them. Peter agrees, but his reasons are different than Ben\u2019s. Kelly says she doesn\u2019t give a shit, just follow through with a plan.\n\nSo extermination it is. During the discussion Peter says he can\u2019t wait to present this to the world. You\u2019re actually surprised he hasn\u2019t been uploading it to the internet in sequences, but he states he wants the whole \u201cepic\u201d before unleashing this masterpiece in its entirety.\n\nThis causes an argument with Ben who has never been fond of the idea of showing this to the world since he\u2019s starting to really believe that the government is behind the Chulocks. Peter says if they are then this would be a good way to expose them.\n\nThe final foray isn\u2019t pretty. You, Ben and Peter descend down as usual. The initial attack goes well. Then the next. And then the next. In fact you\u2019re doing very well, a little too well.\n\nEventually you go the deepest you\u2019ve ever been and find the largest group of Chulocks ever. Ben wastes no time and starts throw grenades. Explosions occur and body parts start to fly. Unfortunately being underground this isn\u2019t the best place for explosions.\n\nAll three of you hightail it out of the area. Peter trips on something and falls. He cries out for you and Ben. You\u2019re about to go back for him, but Ben roughly pushes you forward and says he\u2019s done for and that you have to move.\n\nYou get the very real impression, Ben wanted him to die.\n\nThe collapsing tunnel is followed by an ambush. Apparently the Chulocks were a lot smarter than you thought and dug their own hidden passages and waited for you to be in so deep in their home that you wouldn\u2019t be able to escape effectively.\n\nBen fights valiantly, but the sheer number of them take him down. You see him gruesomely ripped to shreds before your eyes. Your fate is probably less pleasant.\n\nThe Chulocks apparently aren\u2019t just fond of breeding with each other, but are attracted to your \u201cscent\u201d as well. Your clothing is ripped off and you are forced to the ground, beaten, bloody and ultimately violated several times.\n\nThe terror and pain is so great that you actually pass out. For a couple days you\u2019re in those tunnels in a barely conscious state. You don\u2019t come to until several figures in hazmat suits surround you.\n\n\u201cSir we\u2019ve got them all, found this camcorder too.\u201d\n\u201cGood. So has the house been exterminated too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, only two inside. We\u2019ll be tracking the others down from this family soon.\u201d\n\u201cHey this one\u2019s still breathing. Christ, do you think they did what I THINK they did to her?\u201d\n\u201cWell it would explain why they didn\u2019t kill her. Better take her back to the lab for examination. Should be interesting to say the least. Alright boys let\u2019s move out.\u201d\n\nYou are whisked away to a top secret lab.

It is a very nice ring, but you certainly weren\u2019t going to dishonor Mom by ripping it from her corpse. Ultimately your Dad hung on to it, just like he did with most of Mom\u2019s old belongings.\n\n\u201cHere Suzy, I\u2019ve held on to my pain long enough. You take this ring.\u201d\n\nYou take the ring and stare at it for awhile.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure. You\u2019re the one. Try it on just for kicks.\u201d\n\nAt first you think it won\u2019t fit, but apparently you and Mom are about the same size. You like it, but you just can\u2019t let your sisters see it. Hell, maybe you shouldn\u2019t let Peter see it either.\n\nAs you marvel at the ring, your Dad is picking up the urn with your Mom\u2019s ashes. Before you can ask him what he\u2019s doing he opens it and throws the ashes in your face!\n\n\u201cSHE IS THE ONE! YOU CAN POSSESS HER BODY!

Stop this right now you crazy fuck!\u201d you exclaim rolling off the bed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it has to be this way Suzy, but your mother needs a suitable body to return, and you\u2019re perfect in everyway.

I know now what I must do! Bertha I will bring you back!\u201d he exclaims and then runs back to the bedroom.\n\n\u201cPeter call the fucking police, I\u2019m getting the hell outta here, Dad\u2019s lost it!\u201d you shout\n\u201cKevin, make sure you\u2019re getting my good side.\u201d\n\u201cPETER!

The power of lightning will destroy your disobedient soul and allow hers to enter!\u201d he says and then charges at you will the rod.\n\nYou run from your crazy ass Dad and manage to get outside where it\u2019s storming pretty good. You don\u2019t get far when you feel something hit the back of your head and you collapse to the ground.\n\nWith the rain beating down, you feel a kick to your ribs to turn you over.

Everything looks normal. Of course you haven\u2019t actually inspected the little apartment space that exists above the garage where Ed actually sleeps.\n\nYou make your way up the steps only to find Ed isn\u2019t there. His place isn\u2019t exactly as you imagined it. It\u2019s clean! Everything is neatly packed away. In fact he appears to be the neatest person in the house.\n\nHis bed is neatly made and doesn\u2019t appear to be slept in, which is odd since his van is here, unless he made it already and went out during the day without his van. Of course that would be out of character behavior for him as you know him to be a night owl.\n\nYou shrug your shoulders and decide to wait for him. Waiting for you though doesn\u2019t include just sitting, you start to snoop around. Without thinking anything of it you open up his large freezer\u2026\n\nInside are heads and other body parts.

Keep in mind that I kill pretty things like you on a regular basis. If you scream, I\u2019ll do it again, family or not and that would be very regrettable. Besides I doubt if anyone would come running anyway.\u201d\n\nEd\u2019s threat is completely calm which makes it all the scarier. You just sit down and quietly watch him as he approaches.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do to me?\u201d you ask trying not to think about his possible answers.\n\u201cDo? Well\u2026there\u2019s a lot of things I WOULD do to you if you weren\u2019t my niece. You\u2019re just about everything I look for in a girl. Nice, pretty, young. You\u2019re even a virgin aren\u2019t you? Yeah you are. You know how appealing that is in this age of whores who are only suitable for rape and annihilation?\u201d your uncle says licking his knife in front of your face before stepping back.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I WOULD have lots of fun with you. However you\u2019re family, and I always had a lot of respect for my sister. God rest her soul. And from what I know of you, you\u2019re about the only one who followed her value system, which means you respected her too.

That\u2019s the point. They THINK that. They don\u2019t know for sure though, and I thought I was doing a good job of keeping them all away too. (Sigh) But I\u2019m not really worried about you telling any of them, I\u2019m more concerned with you going to the police after you leave here. Then I have to move, and then I\u2019d have to come back and do something bad to you when you least expect it. So what could you do that could convince me?\u201d\n\u201cMy word?\u201d\n\nEd starts to laugh.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! You\u2019re serious? My you are a unique one. God I wish you weren\u2019t family\u2026but anyway no I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t do. While I\u2019m sure you may very well be telling the truth, your moralistic view point and conscience may get the better of you one day and then where would I be. No, I need something else from you. Something that will bond us in a more meaningful way.\u201d\n\nYou start to panic and what he might be implying and you start to cover yourself with your arms and cross your legs. Again he laughs.\n\n\u201cOh no, not that my little Suzy. As much as I might like to, that\u2019s just not something for me to place on the table. Besides it wouldn\u2019t make me inclined to trust you anymore than I do now. Tell me Suzy, what do you know of the Morningstars?\u201d\n\u201cThe Morningstars? You mean the family that lives in that compound up the street? Not much.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I thought as much. They are a strange lot, I\u2019m surprised nobody has complained about them given their blatantly cultish ways.\u201d\n\u201dWell people on this block tend to keep to themselves.\u201d\n\u201cHm, true. One reason why I like living here. It\u2019s perfect really. But there\u2019s really only room for one of us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious dear girl? The Morningstars ARE cultists. Not sure what they worship, but I know damn well in involves human sacrifice. I\u2019ve kept an eye on them ever since I noticed a few of their number taking in young girls.\u201d Ed says while starring at your body. \u201cThese girls are never seen again.\u201d\n\u201cUh, how do you know all this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause sometimes my work overlaps with theirs and I know my prey. And they\u2019re encroaching on it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really aware of me yet, but I think they\u2019ve been getting suspicious.\u201d\n\u201cOkay so what does all this have to do with me?\u201d\n\u201cRight, straight to the point. Well whether you want to be or not, our families are going to embark in a good old fashioned feud. And you\u2019re going to be bait.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. Now as far as I can tell the Patriarch of that family and his eldest son are in absolute control. I figure if you can help me take out those two, that family will fall into chaos and it will be a simple matter of picking off their more incompetent members at leisure.\u201d\n\u201cSo what am I supposed to do exactly?\u201d\n\u201cHeh\u2026yeah I guess you might very well be clueless in this sort of thing. Look Suzy, I know you\u2019re a good girl\u2026but within every good girl lies a filthy dirty whore. A whore that wants to be fucked and desecrated\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Ed seems to be somewhere else for a moment, but he tries to quickly get back on track.\n\n\u201c\u2026uh anyway. YOU need to get in touch with the whore that is within you. You need to flirt, seduce and beguile those two in such a way that will allow me to get them. I really don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have that much of a problem though.\u201d\n\nYou take a deep breath and realize you have little choice, but to agree at this point.\n\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cGood girl. I knew I could count on you. I\u2019ll be in contact with you soon.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Ed grabs your arm as you try to leave.\n\n\u201cRemember, we\u2019re in this together now. Don\u2019t do anything foolish. I really wouldn\u2019t want to have to hurt you.\u201d\n\nWith that final warning, he lets you go.\n\nCompletely unnerved and creeped out, you run back to the basement and pace the floor wondering what you should do next.", "action_results": [{"action": "Obey Uncle Ed", "result": "Ed\u2019s got you so scared that you don\u2019t dare disobey him.

Please don\u2019t let me stop you. In fact I brought you some more appropriate clothing. Wear this.\u201d\n\nYour uncle throws you some clothing at you. It\u2019s a mini skirt and tight top and basically clothing your sister Donna would wear.\n\n\u201cI took the liberty of getting you some more appropriate clothing. I\u2019m pretty sure I got all the bloodstains out.\u201d\n\nYou look at this \u201chookerwear\u201d in disbelief.\n\n\u201cYou expect me to wear this stuff?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be necessary for you to better lure Bobby and Pa Morningstar.

When he realizes what he\u2019s doing he apologizes.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry Suzy. I get in another place sometimes. I guess you\u2019ll want some privacy. I\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d\n\nUncle Ed goes upstairs to wait and you try to psyche yourself up for this ordeal. You look at the clothing and put it on which makes you feel really vulnerable. Your legs are exposed, your stomach isn\u2019t covered. You feel almost naked.\n\nWhen you exit the house it\u2019s twilight. You didn\u2019t realize you slept so long. Ed motions you over to his van where he beeps his horn. You feel like a hooker going to be picked up. You don\u2019t say a word when you get in the van.\n\n\u201cAh yes, you almost look the part now. But let\u2019s do one more thing.\u201d Ed says and then pulls something out of his jacket. It\u2019s lipstick.\n\nUncle Ed gets close to apply it on you. Again you don\u2019t say anything. It doesn\u2019t take long, and then he shows you what you look like in a mirror. He\u2019s done a good job. Probably better than you could have considering you\u2019ve never worn any make up of any kind. It would appear that Uncle Ed\u2019s done this before.\n\n\u201cWish I had some eye liner, but we don\u2019t have time for all that. Your eyes are pretty enough without it though. You\u2019re a very lucky girl to be blessed with such natural beauty.\u201d Ed says as he starts up the van.\n\nThe drive to the park is uneventful. When you get near there, Ed stops the van to brief you.\n\n\u201cAlright, I don\u2019t want to get too close yet, but the father and son duo should be sitting at a picnic table over near that lightly wooded area way over there. I\u2019ve been keeping up with their routines a bit, so they should be there. Now that area is a little secluded, but not enough, I need you to actually lure them into the woods. I\u2019ll take care of the rest. After we do this, me and you will be even and I\u2019ll be able to trust you completely.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t lure them into the woods? What if they try to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t try to kill you. They don\u2019t do it that way. And I have faith that you\u2019ll be able to lure them. No man can resist a whore\u2026\u201d\n\nSensing your uncle is going to his dark place again, you cut the conversation short.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m leaving\u2026\u201d you say quickly getting out of the van and nearly running off. You\u2019re so glad to be out of his presence.\n\nYou look around the park which is still fairly populated at this time, though most of the families are going home now. You\u2019re drawing some looks from several teenage guys though. You get a lot of comments as well. You aren\u2019t used to it so now you\u2019re afraid of getting assaulted by some horny teenagers. But like most teenage guys, they do a lot of barking, but don\u2019t actually do anything.\n\nEventually you reach the area your uncle was talking about. You see a young man sitting at a table by himself, you know that\u2019s Bobby having seen him a few time before in the neighborhood. No sign of his father though. No sign of your uncle either, but you sense he\u2019s somewhere nearby.\n\nAs you approach Bobby you see that he must be preoccupied because he isn\u2019t even looking up. It\u2019s like he\u2019s deep in thought.\n\nSearching your memory of how you\u2019ve seen it done in movies and TV, you try your best to be seductive.\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d Is all you can think of.\n\nBobby looks up.\n\n\u201cErm, hello? Do I know you?\u201d\n\u201cYou might. I\u2019m Suzy. I live down the street from you.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026I haven\u2019t seen you for quite awhile.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m around, I just don\u2019t get out much.\u201d\n\u201cHm. So what brings you out here?\u201d\n\u201cOh sometimes I like to take walks by myself. You know clear my head from family troubles.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can understand all about family trouble, let me tell you. But I\u2019ve never seen you here before. I come here quite a bit and I can honestly say I would remember you walking around.\u201d Bobby says looking you up and down referring to your state of dress.\n\nYou get a little shy, and try to think of an excuse.\n\n\u201cOh this get up? Well, I don\u2019t usually dress like this, these are my sister\u2019s clothes. I lost a bet with her. It\u2019s a bit complicated.\u201d\n\u201cAh, say no more. Family again. (Sigh)\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the second time Bobby\u2019s mentioned family in a distracted manner again, so you decide to follow up on it before he presses you for more information.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d you ask as you sit down.\n\nBobby looks hesitant to tell you at first, but when you smile at him from across the table, he lets down whatever guard he might\u2019ve had up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my Dad. He\u2019s so demanding. I come from a very large family and just because I\u2019m the oldest son I have all this extra responsibility! I\u2019m expected to keep all my siblings in line, I\u2019m supposed to take over when Dad\u2019s gone. I\u2019m supposed to do all this shit and it\u2019s always been that way all my life and it sucks! Tiamat forbid that I get to do some stuff by myself.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026Tiamat?\u201d you question, but Bobby doesn\u2019t stop his rant to explain that oddity.\n\u201cMy Dad still treats me like a little kid sometimes. I have to go with him to do all these important things and he takes every opportunity to point out all my shortcomings, without listening to any of my ideas! We were supposed to do something to today and instead of doing it, we spent the whole day arguing. He stormed off and told me I better get my shit together by the time he comes back. In fact he left not too long after you showed up. If he saw me talking to you, he\u2019d probably accuse me of not paying attention to my so called duties.\u201d\n\u201cIs your dad still here, where did he go?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t be fortunate enough for him to leave me alone that long. He went to go cool off in those woods over there\u2026\u201d\n\nYour heart begins to race quicker at that thought. If Pa Morningstar went into the woods then he might\u2019ve already run into Uncle Ed. Things on your part are probably going to be a lot easier now.\n\nPart of you wants warn Bobby though since you sort of sympathize with him on some level.", "action_results": [{"action": "Warn Bobby", "result": "You can\u2019t go through with this.

You even take Bobby\u2019s hand which shocks him a little.\n\n\u201cBobby, you opened up to me, so I\u2019m going to open up to you.

What\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain, but my uncle is going to kill him!\u201d you exclaim and get up trying to pull Bobby with you.\n\nBobby starts to move, but insists that you tell him in more detail of what is going on. You do in a very condensed fashion which causes him to pause.\n\n\u201cSo wait, you\u2019re working with your uncle to kill me and my dad in the woods? And now you want ME to go in there?\u201d\n\u201cNO! I was bullied into helping my uncle, but I couldn\u2019t do it that\u2019s why I\u2019m warning you now, so that you can save your dad!\u201d\n\nBobby stops completely.\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Come on it may already be too late!\u201d\n\u201cSo what if it is? Look Suzy, you don\u2019t know my dad like I do. The guy has barely any fucking redeeming qualities and those he does have he barely shows most of the time. Fuck him.\u201d\n\u201cB\u2026but he\u2019s your father!\u201d\n\u201cWhat of it? Just because someone is related to you don\u2019t mean anything if they\u2019re complete assholes to you and treat you like shit your whole life. Hell he hasn\u2019t even been the worst to me. He\u2019s been a fucking abusive tyrant to my whole family. I\u2019m sure all of them at some point have thought about killing him themselves. Shit, I know I have.\u201d\n\nYou certainly didn\u2019t expect this reaction. You don\u2019t know what to do now, you start to cry.\n\n\u201cNow what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cI wish I could be that brave, but I\u2019m so scared. Now that you know what\u2019s going on you can avoid your fate. But I\u2019m still in danger. My Uncle Ed is gonna (Sob!) kill me!\u201d\n\u201cHey\u2026Shhh\u2026Hey\u2026don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Look you are brave. I mean it took courage to tip me off didn\u2019t it? You went against your uncle\u2019s threats and took a chance that I wouldn\u2019t flip out and kill you myself right?\u201d\n\u201c(Sniff) I guess so.\u201d\n\u201cLook\u2026your uncle is still expecting me right?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s wait a minute or two, then I\u2019ll go in the woods and I\u2019ll take care of your uncle Ed.\u201d\n\nAt this point Bobby lifts open his jacket and quickly displays a large knife of his own. It\u2019s rather ornate from what little you see of it. \u201cI\u2019m prepared.\u201d He says\n\nHe spends the next few minutes calming you down, but then begins to mumble some sort of prayers. You can\u2019t make out most of them, but they certainly don\u2019t sound Christian and you hear the name Tiamat a lot.\n\nAfter he finishes he turns to you and smiles.\n\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m going into the woods. YOU wait here. Now one of two things will happen. Either I\u2019ll come out and your uncle will be dead. Or your uncle will come out and I\u2019ll be dead, and you can still take credit for luring me into the woods. Just tell him you told me to make up with my dad or something. He should buy that, and you\u2019ll be still be safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMy dad? He\u2019s probably dead. If he was still alive he would\u2019ve came out by now. Obviously Tiamat had forsaken him, if he was taken down by the likes of your uncle.\u201d\n\nBobby makes his way into the woods.\n\nYou wait at the table for awhile in the darkness. There isn\u2019t a soul around. You continue to look into the woods waiting for someone to step out. Bobby, Uncle Ed, Pa Morningstar, anyone\u2026\n\nEventually someone does and it\u2019s Bobby. He looks a little roughed up and there are bloodstains on his clothes. You can only guess that it wasn\u2019t an easy kill.\n\n\u201cSheesh, that was intense. Your uncle might\u2019ve killed me, if I hadn\u2019t known he was lurking around. I think what caused him to go off his game plan was when I mentioned you told me that he was waiting. I think he wanted to yell at that point, because his calm killer demeanor turned into white hot rage. Still he never made a grand outburst, he just mumbled something about ripping you apart after he was done with me. Well we better get out of here. You need a ride home?\u201d\n\nYou back off a little bit. As much as you didn\u2019t want to be involved in Bobby\u2019s murder, you\u2019re not entirely trusting of him. You know for certain that he and his family are indeed cultists that sacrifice people to this Tiamat he\u2019s mentioned a few times.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026not that I don\u2019t appreciate the offer, but maybe I should walk home.\u201d\n\u201cWalk? In that outfit and through this area? You\u2019d be safer with me. I\u2019m not going to do anything to you.\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t going to sacrifice me to Tiamat?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026well I suppose you don\u2019t. However, all I can say is that I\u2019m in a better mood than I was, and that\u2019s thanks mostly to you. I can now run the compound the way I want to and communicate to Tiamat directly as the new high priest. Plus you did warn me of your uncle and possibly saved my life. So I\u2019d say you\u2019re safe. I mean it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to blab about any of this right?\u201d\n\nBobby is smiling. He\u2019s even a little playful, but you get the very real feeling he is warning you.\n\n\u201cNo, no of course I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cGood! I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled then. Come on let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou follow Bobby to his car and sit quietly. Bobby turns on the radio and begins humming happily to the heavy metal music playing. Halfway home he speaks to you directly.\n\n\u201cSo, you wanna go out sometime?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you say in total surprise.\n\u201cDo you wanna go out? I mean it seems like we got some stuff in common. And before all this went down it seemed like there was a spark there. At least I felt a little something. It\u2019s why I told you about my dad, which was a major place of trust on my part given that you were a virtual stranger.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d\n\u201cAs you might guess my family isn\u2019t much for outsiders. None of us gets out all that much. I was one of the luckier ones, being the eldest son and all, but I still had strict guidelines. Fucking your sister alleviates the tension so to speak, but really it doesn\u2019t allow for a good future bloodline. Well that\u2019s the way I see it anyway. So, how about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I dunno. I don\u2019t get out much either. Though that\u2019s by choice, not because anyone made me.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Sounds like you were your own prisoner. Come on, let\u2019s go out. It\u2019ll be good for the both of us, you can tell me all about your obviously fucked up family on the date.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d You laugh.\n\u201cSee that\u2019s the spirit! If it helps you don\u2019t have to dress like that either.\u201d Bobby points at your clothing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally wear this sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I sort of figured that. You didn\u2019t seem comfortable in it from the moment I saw you. Hell, if I had to guess. You\u2019re still a virgin.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re amazed at Bobby\u2019s insight.\n\n\u201cIs it THAT obvious? My Uncle Ed knew too when he roped me into this.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s probably more obvious to us predatory types even if we don\u2019t know that much about the person. Darkness is often drawn to purity. Don\u2019t worry though; Tiamat doesn\u2019t have a predisposition toward virgin blood. You\u2019re still safe.\u201d\n\u201cWell lucky me.\u201d\n\nBobby stops in front of your house. You didn\u2019t realize you were already so close to home.\n\n\u201cHere you are. See, nice and safe. So\u2026do you want to go out sometime?\u201d\n\nYou look at Bobby and its crazy that after all that\u2019s happened tonight, you do feel a certain spark between you.\n\n\u201cOkay what the hell. Come pick me up whenever you\u2019re able I suppose. You know where I live and I never go anywhere so I\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, but first\u2026\u201d\n\nBobby quickly leans over and steals a quick kiss from you before you get out of the car.\n\nYour first kiss. You always wondered if it would happen. You feel completely giggly. He smiles in satisfaction.\n\n\u201cSee you soon!\u201d he says and drives home. You head back to the basement nearly walking on air.

From the sound of it, he\u2019s not to happy with his dad right now who\u2019s supposed to be in the woods, so it wouldn\u2019t be likely he\u2019d follow you there to do anything sexual.\n\nYou decide to try a different approach.\n\n\u201cBobby. I know it might not be my place, but I think you should make up with your father.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re taking his side? Who the hell are you to tell me what to do?!\u201d he snaps. \u201cHold on slow down, I sympathize with you. I really do. But remember he\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nBobby calms down and listens to you.\n\n\u201cSometimes family can be overbearing and annoying and all of that. Trust me I know. But like I said, they\u2019re still family. And when it comes down to it, they\u2019re the only ones who you can usually count on. There\u2019s a bond there. A strong one that shouldn\u2019t be easily broken over a silly argument. I\u2019m sure deep down you dad cares about you.\u201d\n\nBobby looks at you and nods.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026yeah\u2026I suppose you\u2019re right. My dad has always been there for me. For all of us. He must care, I mean I\u2019m the next one to take his place in case anything happens to him. I guess he just wants the best for me. I need to go find him.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to come with you?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, no you\u2019ve done enough. Besides I\u2019m trying to make up with the old bastard, if he sees you, it might get complicated. I need to go alone. Thanks though. Maybe I\u2019ll see you around sometime.\u201d Bobby says quickly getting up to leave.\n\u201cYeah. Maybe. H\u2026hey I\u2019ll stay here though in case he comes out and you miss him okay?\u201d you shout at Bobby, but he\u2019s already entered the woods.\n\nYou wait at the table for awhile in the darkness. There isn\u2019t a soul around. You continue to look into the woods waiting for someone to step out. Bobby, Uncle Ed, Pa Morningstar, anyone\u2026\n\n\u201cSo you ready to go Suzy?\u201d you hear Uncle Ed say as he puts a hand on your shoulder and scaring you again.\n\u201cOh shit! Fuck! You scared me!\u201d you gasp. \u201cWhere the hell did you come from, I didn\u2019t see anyone come out of the woods.\n\u201cOh I took the scenic route. You should be more alert though and look all around you so you don\u2019t get anyone to sneak up on you again. Come on the van\u2019s in the parking lot.\u201d\n\nYou head towards the lot with Uncle Ed by your side the entire time. He\u2019s pretty quiet on the way to the van. He\u2019s not even staring at you anymore. Doesn\u2019t make him any less creepy or dangerous though. In fact the trip back home in the van is pretty quiet as well half way through.\n\n\u201cSo, Suzy how did you manage to do that?\u201d Ed suddenly asks.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cGet those Morningstars to go into the woods, separately too I might add. Boy that made things a lot easier. Thanks. But I never saw you. In fact I thought you\u2019d screwed up at first when I only saw Pa Morningstar there wandering around and so early.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he and his son had an argument. Pa stormed off into the woods to cool off, shortly before I even got there. So that\u2019s why you bumped into him so quickly.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Guess that was a lucky break for you then. What about the son?\u201d\n\u201cI convinced Bobby to make up with his father, because it was important that family stick together no matter what. So he went into the woods to do so.\u201d\n\nUncle Ed nods.\n\n\u201cWell it didn\u2019t go quite as planned, but it went easier than I expected. And more importantly I\u2019m pretty sure I can trust you now. But not just because you\u2019re an accomplice to murder now, but because of what you just said about it being important that family stick together. You really do believe that don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nYou look at Ed, and it takes a lot of effort, but you convince yourself that you do.\n\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\nEd nods again and doesn\u2019t speak again until you get back home at which point he says one last thing to you before you get out of the van.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl Suzy. A very good girl. Your Mom would be proud. Hell, you didn\u2019t even need to rely on your looks. You\u2019re one of the rare ones. (Sigh) Wish things were different, y\u2019know? But things are what they are. Guess I better leave. No sense in causing you distress. This isn\u2019t the life for you. I\u2019ll be out of here by morning.\u201d\n\nEd starts to laugh as he gets out of the van.\n\n\u201cHa ha I just thought of something funny. I killed those two because they were encroaching on my territory, but now I\u2019m leaving anyway. Oh well, guess it just wasn\u2019t their night.\u201d\n\nYou leave Ed to his morbid sense of humor and back to the \u201csafety\u201d of your basement. You don\u2019t leave it for days. You swing from emotion to emotion. Guilt, fear, sickness, sorrow, etc. Eventually you leave to check the garage, because you just have to know if he really left, and he did. Apparently Moon Shadow and Tommy moved into the garage shortly after Ed left. The garage has been completely redecorated into a much \u201chappier\u201d place.\n\nIn time you learn to live with what you were involved in, but you become even more distant and introverted.

They dismiss him as the annoying fuck he is and tell him if he doesn\u2019t get the camera out of their faces they\u2019ll take him in for obstructing a police investigation. Naturally he cries about the Bill of Rights. They follow up with taking his camera away as evidence and throw him into the back of a police car right next to Dad.\n\nThey find Kevin hiding in a cupboard. They find a large quantity of drug on him and he gets a seat in the back of yet another police car.\n\nThe worst part comes when Ben has just happened to come up from his bunker to get some supplies. He thinks government agents finally come to get him and opens fire on them. The shoot out lasts a couple hours and doesn\u2019t end until Ben is lying dead with several gunshots in him. This of course causes great outrage and sorrow from Moon Shadow and Tommy who see this happen before their eyes. They too are taken away.\n\nNeither one of your sisters were home at the time during this drama, but when Kelly finds out when she comes home later, she\u2019s pissed.

Least of all with that disgusting freak!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s just sex. Look if it\u2019ll make you feel any better, Kevin will wear a condom.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That wasn\u2019t part of the plan. You said I could fuck her straight bareback if she agreed to help us\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNOBODY IS FUCKING ME!\u201d you yell to make yourself heard and your attitude on the situation final, unfortunately Kevin doesn\u2019t seem to get it.\n\n\u201cAw come on Suzy, I know you gotta be dyin\u2019 to get laid.\u201d He says and starts to grope your breasts with one hand, and grind up against your ass. You can feel his little cock poking you and that\u2019s when you totally lose it.\n\n\u201cLeave me the fuck alone asshole!\u201d you say and throw Kevin on the floor. You then proceed to kick him.\n\n\u201cAh! Shit! Damn! Fuck! Feels good!\u201d Kevin says. Sonofabitch is actually enjoying you kick the shit out of him. To be quite honest you\u2019re starting to like it too, you wonder if you\u2019ve learned something about yourself today.\n\nPeter of course gets a cunning plan.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, this could still work. Suzy would you be interested in wearing a dominatrix outfit while you beat the hell out of Kevin? You wouldn\u2019t have to have sex with him and this could still serve as the romance scene for my movie.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Agree with Peter's idea", "result": "\u201cSure, why not, I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d You say stopping momentarily from kicking Kevin.\n\u201cGreat! My movie will be even better! There\u2019s a dominatrix outfit in that bag, don\u2019t worry nobody else has worn it yet.\u201d\n\nYou quickly get the outfit and head to the small enclosed toilet area in the basement to change. The leather \u201ccatsuit\u201d is a tight fit, but that\u2019s to be expected. You feel a sense of euphoria overwhelm you, never before have to felt so comfortable.\n\nWhen you leave, you see Peter has the camera in hand and Kevin is all stretched out and tied up to one of the hanging ceiling pipes in the main area of the basement, rather than your room. Which is just as well since you really didn\u2019t want any mess there\n\n\u201cHey you look great Suzy. You\u2019ll find some useful tools in that bag too. Just grab some and do whatever comes natural.\u201d\n\nAnd you do. Boy, do you ever! You start out by whipping Kevin on his back at first. Much like the kicking, he seems to enjoy it.\n\nYou then move on to a big paddle and start spanking his bare ass. Again he likes it. He\u2019s also probably not registering a lot of the pain due to his drug intake. This frustrates you. You want him to HURT.\n\nYou pull out a big ass dildo next\u2026\n\nHe feels that. Boy, does he ever!\n\n\u201cPeter! This wasn\u2019t part of the deal! I don\u2019t want to be ARGH penetrated!\u201d\n\u201cShut up and like it, bitch!\u201d you snarl.\n\u201cBeautiful! This is great stuff!\u201d Peter exclaims getting a close up.\n\nYou continue to abuse Kevin\u2019s rectum with the dildo for a good ten minutes the whole time he\u2019s begging you to stop. It\u2019s completely covered in blood and shit by the time you\u2019re tired of using it.\n\n\u201cIs that it? Damn I was hoping for more.\u201d Peter says.\n\u201c\u2026No\u2026no more\u2026no\u2026\u201d Kevin sputters in exhausted pain.\n\nYou say nothing and throw the dildo back in the bag and reach in for something else, namely a strap on. You quickly adjust it to your leather catsuit.\n\nThis time you put a ball gag on Kevin so that he can\u2019t scream as loud from the irreparable damage you\u2019re about to do to his motherfucking asshole.\n\nPeter is there get shot after shot of the fairly gruesome scene. He makes sure to get a close up of the anguish on Kevin\u2019s face, and the look of ecstasy in yours when you have an orgasm sometime during your rape of Kevin\u2019s gaping hole.\n\nEventually Kevin passes out from the pain and you decide you\u2019ve had your fill too. Peter stops filming.\n\n\u201cThat was better than I could\u2019ve imagined! Thanks Suzy! I swear you are definitely getting credit and five percent of profits from this movie when it becomes a hit! Man, I never knew you had that in you. You should think about doing that full time. You could get paid serious money. Hell you already have the dungeon atmosphere for it. Go ahead and keep the outfit and bag of goodies, I get the feeling you\u2019ll be wanting them.\u201d\n\nPeter unties Kevin and carries his unconscious body out the door.\n\nYou take Peter\u2019s advice under strong consideration. You were looking for a job; well this would be a good one. You could schedule clients online, be your own boss and never even have to leave the basement. Best of all you can have mind blowing orgasms and technically not actually have to fuck anyone thus retaining your good girl status.\n\nAnd so it happens, you pursue this life with a new found motivation.

Kevin has been helping me a lot, but I don\u2019t have any money to actually pay him most of the time. I see sex as a mutually beneficial exchange.

That\u2019s why despite our differences I\u2019ve always considered you my best friend after all these years.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh. So what did you want to see me about?\u201d you ask\n\u201cOh we can talk about that later, you should enjoy yourself now.\u201d\n\u201cJulie, as you pointed out nobody else is here yet! Also, I just came over to talk to you, not hang out at your party, so now is a good time to tell me. You said it was important.\u201d\n\nJulie begins to get a little nervous now, and tries to avoid the situation.\n\n\u201cHa ha, yeah well. Maybe it wasn\u2019t as important as I thought I guess. It\u2019s funny to see you here; I almost didn\u2019t expect you to come, but now that you are, stay!\u201d\n\u201cJulie, you mean to tell me you wasted my time, and lied to me?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I just\u2026yeah I guess it\u2019s important, I just can\u2019t tell you right now. I will later I promise. Please can\u2019t you just stay for the party?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that Julie really does want you to stick around, but at this point you\u2019re very exasperated. You don\u2019t like leaving your basement without a good reason.\n\nYou didn\u2019t come here to play games. You give Julie one last chance.\n\n\u201cLook Julie, if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on right now I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Please no!

I think you\u2019re my soul mate!\u201d she blurts out. \u201cThere I said it.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re in too much shock to even reply at this revelation. All you know is she wasn\u2019t joking about it being important.\n\n\u201cWhew, I feel like a great weight has been lifted off of me. I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to tell you without being drunk, but I\u2019m glad you forced it out of me. You always lead me to the right decision. It\u2019s why I love you.\u201d\n\u201cStop\u2026just stop Julie.\u201d You say, sitting down trying to take all this in.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Suzy? I mean I thought you might be into this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? And what made you think that?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on Suzy, you\u2019re still a fucking virgin. You\u2019ve never shown any interest in guys, so I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re a closet lesbian.\u201d\n\u201cGlad it\u2019s obvious to you, because it sure wasn\u2019t to me. Look I need to wrap my head around this. I gotta get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut what Julie? What am I supposed to do fall down on my knees and start munching your rug? Look maybe YOU\u2019VE had those feelings, but I haven\u2019t. I mean I suppose we\u2019re friends and all, but quite frankly we\u2019re VERY different people and wouldn\u2019t be compatible in a relationship even if I was so inclined to pursue one with a woman. Which I\u2019m not. At least not now.\u201d\n\nJulie begins to look very hurt and upset.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026you could right?\u201d\n\u201cLook Julie, it\u2019s not going to happen. First of all you\u2019d have to undergo some serious lifestyle changes which I doubt if you\u2019re even capable of. Second of all I question whether or not what you feel right now is going to last. You have a habit of falling in love every other week.\u201d\n\u201cNo it not like that! I\u2019ve always felt this way! And I\u2019ll do anything for us to be together!\u201d\n\u201cJulie, forgive me if I don\u2019t share your delusions. Look, I know that you probably believe what you\u2019re saying, but let\u2019s just forget about this shall we?\u201d\n\nAt this point Julie starts to cry which is followed up by her running into the bathroom and slamming the door. You think about trying to console her, but that\u2019s probably only going to make things worse.\n\nLacking any other ideas, you decide to go home and let Julie work it out herself.\n\nOn your way home, you run into Donna and a bunch of her slutty friends.\n\n\u201cSuzy? What the hell are YOU doing out of the basement, you never go anywhere!\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back from Julie\u2019s. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d\n\u201cComing back from there? We\u2019re going there! Julie invited all of us to her party. Normally we wouldn\u2019t get there so early, but we figured we\u2019d like to get the first dibs on the guys.\u201d\n\u201cYeah she invited me too, but she wanted to talk about something else.\u201d You say and then feel the need to tell Donna more.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026Donna can I talk to you about something in private?\u201d\n\u201cSure, hey you guys just go on, I\u2019ll catch up.\u201d Donna tells her friends.\n\nAfter her friends leave you tell Donna everything that happened between you and Julie. Donna\u2019s intrigued, but is shocked at your response.\n\n\u201cSo you just left her to cry?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, I mean if I stayed I would\u2019ve just made things worse. She\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\u201cNo she won\u2019t! She basically just admitted to you that she\u2019s loved you all her life and had a hard time even admitting it to you. And you basically just stomped all over her little heart! She\u2019s supposed to be your friend. The ONLY one you really have, and you didn\u2019t even give her a chance!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, key word being FRIEND. I never felt that way and I\u2019ve known Julie a lot longer and better than you have and she\u2019s incapable of having a stable relationship with anyone. She\u2019s wild party girl just like you.\u201d\n\nNow Donna gets offend by your rude choice of words.\n\n\u201cOh I see. Just because Julie isn\u2019t some stick in the mud flying nun who\u2019s only knowledge of a so called relationship is with a piece of battery powered machinery, she\u2019s a whore that\u2019s incapable of change or true feelings huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\nAnd you see me and Julie as one of the same too, right?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck you Suzy! I know what you think. Let me tell you what I think! I think you\u2019re an emotional cripple who\u2019s so fucking scared of the real world so you hide out from it in your goddamn basement!

Most of Donna\u2019s friends are already talking to various guys. No sign of Donna or Julie though. You ask where they are and someone dismissively says her bedroom.\n\nYour heart sinks when you hear this. You can\u2019t believe you were briefly swayed by Donna\u2019s self-righteous speech!

Your back arches in excitement as she proceeds to bring you closer to a climax.\n\nYou don\u2019t get a chance to return the favor because when Julie finally causes you to have an orgasm you soon fall asleep completely satisfied.\n\nA couple hours later you feel something completely different. Something going inside you. You open your eyes and see a teenage guy on top of you. He\u2019s a little shocked when you scream, which is good because it gives you enough time to push him off of you and roll of the bed. You pick up a nearby lamp ready to throw it if necessary.\n\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa! No need for that! I thought you were passed out!\u201d The teenager explains.\n\u201cPassed out?

Let\u2019s move on shall we?\n\nBen: This is your older brother and the oldest of your siblings. He\u2019s a paranoid survivalist nut that trains for inevitable apocalypse that\u2019s going to come. He walks around armed at all times and is convinced that THEY are out to get him. He also has a misguided biracial hippy girlfriend by the name of Moonshadow and an illegitimate son with her by the name of Tommy who is an idiot savant. Currently they all live out in the backyard though Ben\u2019s been building an underground bunker of some sort out there.\n\nKelly: This is your Amazonian older sister. She\u2019s in a small time roller derby league and has been known to do some illegal underground fight club shit on the side. She\u2019s probably the only one in the house that has closest thing to a \u201creal\u201d job. Kelly\u2019s never liked you, for various reasons. When you two were growing up she\u2019d always try to take every opportunity she could to abuse you in some way. Fortunately she\u2019s mostly too busy working to engage in physical or psychological torture on you nowadays.\n\nPeter: This is your younger brother. He\u2019s a pretentious effeminate aspiring film maker who has the annoying habit of attempting to record everything with his camcorder. Has the disturbing habit of stealing your clothes and wearing them. He also hangs out with a junkie drug dealer from school by the name of Kevin who is always lecherously looking at you when you\u2019re around.\n\nDonna: This is your younger sister and the youngest of your siblings. She\u2019s probably the most \u201cnormal\u201d out of all of you. Perhaps a little on the wild side, but nothing excessively out of hand, basically your typical high school girl who hangs out with others similar to her. She\u2019s probably the most alright with you, though sometimes she urges that you should get out more.\n\nDad: This is your Dad (George McCray is his real name). He used to be a traveling lightning rod salesman. He\u2019s retired now and hasn\u2019t really been the same since your Mom died. He\u2019s usually in various stages of drunkenness and nobody much pays any serious attention to him anymore. It\u2019s not like he was around for the parenting process anyway.\n\nMom: This is your Mom (Bertha McCray is her real name). Despite her overprotective moralist views on how you and your sisters should act, she was probably the one who kept some semblance of order on the family. When the flesh eating virus consumed her years ago, everyone missed her a lot especially your dad. Eventually she was cremated and her ashes are kept in your Dad\u2019s room.\n\nEd: This is your really creepy uncle and brother of your late mother. It was her dying wish that he have some place to stay, so he lives in the garage which he\u2019s pretty much made his domain as most other family members stay clear of him, even Ben. He doesn\u2019t have any visible means of support yet contributes to the household at times. There are certainly rumors and whispers of what he might be up to when he leaves and comes back at various hours of the night, but nobody really wants to talk to him directly about it, let alone go in the garage and find out.\n\nJulie: This is your \u201cbest friend\u201d since kindergarten, who you speak to less and less with each passing year. As you grew older the pair of you had very different lives. Julie was very wild in her teenage years and still is today. It is only due to the fact that you knew each other for so long that you two are even still in contact. She\u2019s probably remained in contact with you mainly because you are about the only stable person in her life that she feels that she can talk to on a serious level about shit that sometimes bothers her.\n\nThe Morningstars: While your family on the block is rightfully seen as the most dysfunctional lot to live there, The Morningstars are definitely running a close second. They\u2019ve converted their house into something of a compound. There seems to be a bunch of them of varying ages and gender, but \u201cPa\u201d Morningstar and his eldest son Bobby Morningstar stand out the most.

You\u2019re taken off guard and forget about your unnatural feelings for a moment.\n\n\u201cSuperman?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, maybe if you read some other comics it will help ease your transition. The only thing is, you could get addicted to those, so be careful.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know, this could work. I never really was interested in these types before, so I probably won\u2019t get too attached.\u201d\n\u201cAnd unlike the anime shit, you got more of a variety meaning you\u2019re less likely to get obsessed with one thing. I mean the characters are at least different from each other in looks and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a great idea! I just wish I had some money to go down to the comic shop and try this out!\u201d\n\u201cHere, take these. I never bother rereading them.\u201d Patricia says handing you a bunch of superhero comics.\n\u201cAlright! Thanks!\u201d you say and run down to the basement.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, but the fact that Patricia was into comics didn\u2019t make you more aroused like it would most loser geeks. It might be due to the fact that you were so thankful that someone was not only willing to talk to you, but help you that caused you to no longer look at her with nearly overwhelming lust.\n\nOkay, so after you read them, you DO spend an inordinate amount of time rubbing the comics on yourself and enjoying her \u201cscent\u201d and think about her while you jack off a little bit. But you still feel a little better, like the obsession has lessened a little.\n\nPatricia comes over several more times as your Mom tutors her and she brings you more comics. You appreciate it, but eventually she doesn\u2019t need anymore tutoring and you miss her and the comics especially since the comics were working.\n\nYou get depressed and mope around the house, but your Mom is quite tired of you in general at this point.\n\n\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re trying to beat your fucking addiction, but you\u2019re taking too fucking long about it! If you\u2019re going to insist on being a man-child that lives in my goddamn basement forever, the least you can do is go and get a fucking job! In fact you ARE going to get one, or I\u2019m kicking your fat ass out!\u201d\n\nSince you don\u2019t have much of a choice, you leave the house for the first time in a long time. The sunlight burns your pasty skin and eyes, but you waddle down the street in your quest to find a job.\n\nThe problem is, you don\u2019t even know where to look, so you just end up going to the comic shop to read them without paying.\n\nJake the comic shop owner sees you enter and is really surprised.\n\n\u201cBrian is that you? Shit man, thought you might\u2019ve died of a heart attack or gotten arrested for having child porn on your computer har har har har! Where have you been? You\u2019ve missed several issues of your favorite Japanese shit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been here, I destroyed my entire collection. I\u2019ve quit it cold turkey, but it hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d\n\u201cShit, that\u2019s almost hard to believe, but then again you never were one to miss an issue before, so I guess you\u2019re telling the truth. But what brings you back here?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, my mom told me to look for a job or she\u2019s going to kick me out. I dunno what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you could work here, I need someone to lug around the comic boxes. I\u2019m going to be doing some rearranging.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Are you serious, I thought Ron did that.\u201d\n\u201cRon\u2019s fuckin\u2019 dead. Found the asshole dead with a broken neck in my fucking bathroom! He was looking at one of those sex comics and the dumb ass decided to try autoerotic asphyxiation. I swear that\u2019s the last time I hire a retard.\u201d\n\nThis could be an opportunity to save yourself from being homeless, or it could be a relapse back into your former addiction. Remember, you\u2019d be working right at the source.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the job", "result": "This is going to be very difficult, but you\u2019d rather risk getting addicted again than being homeless.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the job.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, but let\u2019s get something straight first. I\u2019m going to be watching you CLOSE. While you say that you\u2019ve kicked the anime habit, I remember when you were a little junkie, so I don\u2019t want to find out if you\u2019re stealing shit, because I will be kicking your fat ass if that\u2019s ever the case.\u201d Jake threatens.\n\nYou nod and agree meekishly where upon Jake tells you go start moving and unpacking boxes.\n\nThis is probably the first time you\u2019ve actually had to do any \u201chard work\u201d in your life. Moving the boxes is an effort for you and you have to rest several times. Jake yells and screams at you the entire time. You almost think he\u2019s going to fire you that day, but he never does. You can only assume he\u2019s really desperate for help and he must be considering he hired you.\n\nThe only good thing about all this, is that you\u2019re too damn tired to even think about your anime addiction, but this is just the first day after all\u2026\n\nWhen you get home, your mother is a little surprised to see you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been out? I figured you were down in the basement.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I got a job. You said you were going to kick me out if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYOU DID?! How much does it pay?\u201d\n\u201cNot much, I work at the comic shop\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well I suppose it was too much to hope for that you\u2019d actually be able to move out one day\u2026(Sigh) Alright, I guess you made the effort, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little idiotic to work at a place like that given your addiction?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\nYour mother just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cWell you never were the brightest. However, considering that you\u2019re making your own money now, you can use THAT to feed your addiction if it should flare up again. And you WILL be paying me back for all that shit you bought with my stolen credit card you asshole!\u201d your Mom says while hitting you upside the head.\n\nYou head back down to your basement completely exhausted by today\u2019s labor. You don\u2019t even jack off, you just fall asleep. You MUST be tired!\n\nAs the days go by you go about your job, but you start to feel the temptation. Especially when a big shipment of Japanese DVDs, graphic novels and comics arrive.\n\nYou\u2019re trying hard not to look too much at the Japanese shit. REALLY hard. In fact something else is starting to get hard and you\u2019re starting to hear shit in the stock room.\n\n\u201cTee hee! Come on, open us up! We\u2019ve never been touched yet!\u201d a little girl voice says.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cYeah, come on Brian, what\u2019s wrong? You used to like to deflower us and run your hands ALL over us. I remember how you used to spew all your delicious spunk on our 2-Dimensional faces! Mmmm! Come back to us! We\u2019ll love being your little fuck slut in LOLI-WHORE SCHOOL! Tee hee!\u201d\n\u201cI was a different person, look I read different comics now. I need some variety.\u201d\n\u201cHey man, I\u2019m all for variety, you remember that time you bought that ORGY OF THE CYBERNETIC TENTACLE MUTANTS anime DVD? We\u2019ve got it all! You should come back to us. It\u2019s pointless to resist.\u201d a more robotic voice says.\n\u201cShhhhh! Shut up about that! I was uh\u2026 just wondering what the appeal was! Look I\u2019ve been reading some super hero stuff, and I\u2019m starting to like that now, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBah! Super heroes! You actually like those muscle bound parodies of the masculine form? I remember when you appreciated a more subtle type of hero. One who was shy, soft spoken and had a large dose of ambiguous sexuality to them. Hey if you don\u2019t like girls anymore, we got things to satisfy those urges too you know! Like SHOTA DICKGIRL ADVENTURES!\u201d an effeminate male voice says.\n\u201cGAH! Leave me alone!\u201d\n\u201cWell there\u2019s always\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, you can\u2019t say you never thought about it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s completely normal. They even did a CSI episode of it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you FUCKING say it!\u201d\n\n\u201cFurries.\u201d\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d\n\nAt this point you run out of the stock room and the comic shop screaming your head off. You don\u2019t stop running until you collapse from exhaustion which means you only get to the end of the block thanks to your poor physical condition.\n\nFortunately some kind soul helps you.\n\n\u201cHey Brian, are you okay?\u201d Patricia asks.\n\nYour eyes flutter open and you look up to see an angel of perfection. Your eyes follow her exposed legs, at this angle you can see up her dress. White panties. The color of purity.\n\nShe\u2019s so pure. She\u2019s sooooo good. You take one look at her smiling face and you ejaculate in your skidmarked underwear, giving something else for your poor mom to clean.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay\u2026I just\u2026I dunno. Some weird shit happened.\u201d\n\u201cIt happens. Okay let\u2019s help you up.\u201d\n\nAs Patricia helps you up, you smell the scent of her hair\u2026SMMMMMM AHH! It smells like heaven!\n\nYou just want to tell her how much you like her right now. You\u2019re sure that IF you just had a girlfriend you could get over your addiction a lot quicker.\n\nFar be it from me to warn you about this course of action. But you\u2019re doing it again.\n\nYou start sweating and breathing heavy. Patricia\u2019s looking at you with concern.\n\n\u201cAre you alright? You look a little flush.\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026I dunno\u2026it addiction is really hard to break and I liked it when we used to speak and stuff. It kept my mind off things a lot better. You were so nice and understanding.\u201d\n\u201cAwww\u2026look I didn\u2019t know I had so much of an effect. I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll try to make some time for us to talk every once in awhile\u201d\n\nWell fortunately for you, you weren\u2019t quite brave enough to admit your inappropriate feelings directly and she takes what you say completely out of context.\n\n\u201cSo where were you heading?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cOh\u2026uh the comic shop. I work there now.\u201d\n\u201cYou do? Well no wonder you nearly had a relapse silly!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well Jake might fire me after this.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019s always nice to me and gives me discounts. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThis probably doesn\u2019t make things easier for you since this naivety just turns you on more. You have to fight the urge to pull it out and start wackin\u2019 it as you stare at her ass the whole time you\u2019re walking back to the comic shop.\n\nJake is about ready to yell at you, but when he sees Patricia he focuses on her instead. You quietly go back and move boxes, getting to keep your job. Once again Patricia has helped you out. This girl MUST be yours! She\u2019s everything you could ever want in a girl. She\u2019s perfection.\n\nTime passes and you continue to work at the comic shop and spend time with Patricia when you can. It\u2019s good for you. You get exercise and get to spend time with a pretty girl\u2026 who just happens to be your underage cousin.\n\nPatricia also encourages you to read more American comics which you start doing on a regular basis. Of course now this means you\u2019ve got a little more to talk about with Patricia and your feelings for her are getting to a point where it\u2019s getting harder to not hide.", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell Patricia how you really feel about her", "result": "It\u2019s too much; you just can\u2019t hide it anymore. You HAVE to tell her!\n\nOne day when you\u2019re alone with her in your basement, you just blurt it out.\n\n\u201cPatricia, you\u2019ve been so nice to me. More than a basement dweller like me deserves. And I know this is wrong, but I\u2019ve grown to love you. I can only hope that somewhere within you, you love me too.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re never going to believe this, but Patricia doesn\u2019t run away in terror screaming. Though she does look a little apprehensive and starts edging away from you.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026Brian. I\u2019m flattered, but\u2026uh I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, I know it\u2019s wrong. I used to read the SUPER HAPPY INCEST FAMILY comic series. But I can\u2019t help but feel this way about you!\u201d\n\u201cBrian, I know you\u2019re desperate for female companionship, but maybe you just need to jack off or something.\u201d\n\u201cJacking off has lost all meaning now. At one time I used to just be satisfied with images of anime girls getting raped, but now that I\u2019ve been in close and civilized contact with a real woman on a regular basis I want more.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you find a different girl?\u201d\n\u201cWhat other girl wants me? You\u2019re the only one I know who understands me!\u201d\n\u201cBut dude, I\u2019m your cousin!\u201d\n\u201cSo? Samurai Warrior Raki Onari fell in love with his\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Patricia slaps you.\n\n\u201cDamn it Brian! I thought you were past this! You aren\u2019t a samurai, I ain\u2019t some geisha and this ISN\u2019T an anime comic! You need to get this Jap shit outta your head once and for all!\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know! (Sob!) But its like with you around, all my anime fantasies could come true! I mean maybe you could even put on some cat ears\u2026\u201d\n\nYour cousin slaps you again.\n\n\u201cNO! FUCK NO! Look Brian if you expect any kind of relationship with me, you won\u2019t be making me dress up in anything remotely furry!\u201d\n\u201c(Sob) I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just\u2026wait\u2026did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI said if you want any chance with me, you better knock off this anime shit for good!\u201d\n\nYou can hardly believe your ears. Against all odds your pretty teenage cousin is offering to have a relationship you. It seemed like she was prett against it just a moment ago. At this point you pinch your own ass just make sure you\u2019re not dreaming.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhy the fuck are you pinching your own ass?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind. I\u2019m just over thrilled that you aren\u2019t calling the police on me. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve made this decision! I can be so good for you; you\u2019ll see\u2026but uh, remember we\u2019ll have to keep this a secret.\u201d\n\u201cNo shit. We\u2019d probably look suspicious hanging out together if most folks wouldn\u2019t ever believe that I\u2019d be caught dead fucking someone that looks like you! Hah! Though all that box lifting at the comic shop must\u2019ve had an effect on you. You\u2019re putting on a little more muscle rather than remaining the disgusting blob you were before.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026thanks I think...\u201d\n\nNow at this point someone less desperate would sense something is amiss personality wise with this chick, but of course you\u2019re not really thinking about that.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about it when she starts sucking your cock, minutes after this conversation.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about it when she punches you in the face after swallowing your load.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about it when she\u2019s fucking you while your mom is out of the house.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about it when she begins to constantly insult you and physically abuse you whenever possible.\n\nAfter getting a dildo shoved up your ass during a particularly rough round of sex, you begin to think about it!\n\nOver the past few months you\u2019ve come to find out that your lovely Patricia is bat shit insane. Lots of stuff you didn\u2019t know about her come to light, like your previous notions of her being some beacon of purity were completely wrong as well. She\u2019s been fucking guys since sixth grade. (Definitely shows when she\u2019s fucking you too) She\u2019s also supposed to be taking meds and she hasn\u2019t. You don\u2019t exactly know what mental illness she has, but she\u2019s definitely not a well girl. (This really shouldn\u2019t surprise you considering she\u2019s fucking you)\n\nNone of this would be so bad, if she hadn\u2019t become so increasingly sadistic towards you. You\u2019ve been letting her get away with it too, so she\u2019s just getting worse.\n\nThe only good thing about all this is you haven\u2019t once been thinking about anime. Not because you\u2019ve got something else to concentrate on now, but because you\u2019ve learned to associate anime with pain and fear. (Which is a fetish you definitely haven\u2019t embraced) Anytime you showed signs of relapsing again, your cousin would punish you severely. (Even more than usual)\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lesson to be learned and the philosophical idea of being careful of wishing and all that other shit, but really none of that is going to help you right now. You can either stay in this completely fucked up relationship or try to break up with her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Break up with this crazy bitch!", "result": "Seriously? Shit, I didn\u2019t think you had it in you.\n\nYou gather up all your courage for your next meeting with Patricia. You\u2019re really nervous and on edge. Your mom notices this before she goes to work.\n\n\u201cHey Brian.\u201d\n\u201cAGHH! SHIT!\u201d you shout, not realizing she was there. \u201cDamn you scared me.\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, it\u2019s just me. Shit, Patricia\u2019s got you more jumpy than a five year old at a NAMBLA convention.\u201d\n\u201cPatricia? Uh I dunno\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCut the shit son, I know all about it. I wash your sheets remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou knew? You didn\u2019t care?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say I approved, but I guess I felt sorry for you. I mean hell you were finally getting laid and on a regular basis too. I figured if she got pregnant we\u2019d just abort the unholy bastards. I didn\u2019t quite know how crazy Patricia was until I spoke to her mother recently though. I imagine you didn\u2019t either, but you were just so grateful for someone to fuck you. My sister Evelyn said they were going to ship her to some convent in South Seas, but strangely your relationship with her has had a calming effect. She seems to let most of her crazy shit out on you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I noticed and I don\u2019t think I like it anymore.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say I blame you. I\u2019m glad to see you have a backbone somewhere in that out of shape body of yours. Ah fuck, maybe some of this is my fault. I should\u2019ve gotten you a hooker when you turned sixteen. At least you might\u2019ve avoided this fucked up relationship.\u201d\n\nAt this point your mom opens up her purse and takes out her handgun and gives it to you.\n\n\u201cHere, take this. If you\u2019re going to break up with her, you might need it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill her!\u201d\n\u201cHopefully it doesn\u2019t come to that, but given how she is, you\u2019d better have something to protect yourself. Now I\u2019m going to work. Good luck son, and you better not leave a big fucking mess for me to clean up.\u201d\n\nWow, that\u2019s gotta be the first time your mom\u2019s been supportive. Of course now you\u2019re even more nervous.\n\nEventually Patricia comes over. She\u2019s in a horny mood and grabs your balls hard when you open the door.\n\n\u201cHey you fucking perv. You ready to shove that little dick in me for a good two minutes before you get too tired? Hah! You\u2019re such a loser!\u201d she says and then shoves her tongue in your mouth.\n\nYou push her back a bit and cover your balls while rubbing them in pain.\n\n\u201cPatricia, we really gotta talk.\u201d\n\u201cYes we do! I wanna talk about the last Batman comic! Can you believe that\u2026\u201d she says changing her tone as usual.\n\u201cNo, Patricia we gotta talk about us.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\nWhile Patricia looks at you expectantly, you start and stop several times in an attempt to tell her it\u2019s over, but just can\u2019t do it. Patricia on the other hand realizes what\u2019s going on and she gets very upset.\n\n\u201cYou fucking bastard\u2026you\u2019re breaking up with me aren\u2019t you? YOU UNGRATEFUL PIECE OF SHIT!\u201d\n\u201cNow Patricia, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\u201cOh then how is it like? I gave my body, my love, my fuckin\u2019 SOUL to your sorry ass and this is how you repay me? Oh fuck no; you\u2019re not getting away with this shit!\u201d\n\nPatricia doesn\u2019t attack like you think she was going to, she starts to leave.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\u201dMe? I\u2019m going home, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing! And I\u2019m telling everyone of how you\u2019ve been molesting and raping me on a routine basis. You\u2019ll be locked up and I hope some big ass black guys shove their dicks up your bitch ass every night!\u201d\n\u201cPatricia, your parents and my mom already know about us.\u201d You say in the hopes it\u2019ll stop her.\n\nPatricia does stop. She didn\u2019t expect that, but she quickly resumes her tirade.\n\n\u201cSo what? Then they\u2019ll get in trouble too! I\u2019m still underage not to mention your fucking cousin! I\u2019ll just go straight to the police and they\u2019ll take you all in! Regardless of what happens, you\u2019re still going to be in major fucking trouble and you\u2019ll still be taking it in the ass in jail!\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s fear, maybe it\u2019s anger, maybe it\u2019s a combination, but you pull the gun on Patricia and order her to stop.\n\n\u201cPatricia, I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d You say, while Patricia looks at you in disbelief.\n\u201cBrian?! You\u2019d actually shoot me? Someone you used to love?\u201d\n\u201cI still love you Patricia, but I can\u2019t let you go now. I would\u2019ve before, but given your threats and your past abuses towards me, I can\u2019t take that chance. You\u2019re too chaotic\u2026and I gotta do this.\u201d\n\nPatricia drops to her knees before you and starts to tear up. Her voice starts to quiver as she begs for her life.\n\n\u201cBrian\u2026(sob) please. Don\u2019t do this! I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to treat you like that. I\u2019m just all fucked up when I\u2019m not on my medication. I\u2019ll start taking it! We can still be together. Just please (sob) Don\u2019t kill me!\u201d\n\nFor a moment you drop your guard. It\u2019s a moment though that is your downfall. Patricia punches you in the nuts and tries to wrestle the gun from your hand. In the ensuing struggle she manages to turn the gun on you and pull the trigger. You feel pain spread from your stomach to every other inch of your body. However unlike the movies, this doesn\u2019t result in some \u201cshocked\u201d expression and you falling limp in slow motion.
