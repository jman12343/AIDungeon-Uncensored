Do you\u2026\u201d\n\nClick.\n\nYou\u2019re so damn sick of these Ground Zero commercials you think as you turn the TV off. If you older brother Ben hadn\u2019t shot his family and himself in a tragic paranoid breakdown you can only imagine he\u2019d be going on about how right he was in building that underground bunker out in your backyard.\n\nYou look at the time and realize you\u2019ve spent most of the day procrastinating watching TV even though there\u2019s not much on that interests you on TV anymore. All the channels you used to watch that had interesting shit on them now all have shallow reality shows and quite frankly you\u2019ve got enough dysfunctional family drama going on in real life without needing to watch it on TV.\n\nYou remember a time when you could avoid most of the mess by hiding out in your basement. Unfortunately you can\u2019t even do that anymore. Ever since dad drank himself to death, the gravy train of living at home for free came to an end.\n\nWithout the help of your dad\u2019s pension checks anymore, your older Amazonian sister Kelly said there was no way in hell that she was going to keep supporting the house on her own unless she was the only one living in it. Seeing as she\u2019s a roller derby bitch as well as an illegal fight club brawler, it isn\u2019t like you or any of your siblings were in any position to argue with her.\n\nYour younger brother Peter, having given up his lofty dreams of being a famous movie director now spends a lot of his time in the garage making amateur porn with various guys he picks up at the clubs. He makes enough money through his website that it keeps Kelly off his back. He seems to enjoy what he\u2019s doing and at least he\u2019s not stealing your clothes anymore.\n\nYour younger sister Donna simply moved out and moved in with your best friend Julie who is still the eternal party girl. Really you\u2019re surprised Julie hasn\u2019t caught every STD known to man at this point. To be honest Donna\u2019s had more in common with Julie than you have for many years now. You\u2019re sure Donna\u2019s a lot happier at a \u201cparty house.\u201d\n\nAs for you, you didn\u2019t have much in the way of options. Trying to get a job has failed spectacularly in this economy. Though your\u2026\u201dunique\u201d and reclusive personality doesn\u2019t exactly help in that department.\n\nGiven some of the junk that\u2019s laying around the house you sometimes wonder if you shouldn\u2019t try to sell some of it over the Internet to support yourself. Seems like a lot of work though and you\u2019re no wheeler and dealer.\n\nDonna suggested that you move in with her and Julie, but that whole scene isn\u2019t for you. As much as you hate dealing with Kelly, you\u2019d also hate having to put up with drunk horny guys (and girls) trying to get into your pants every five minutes, not to mention the loud music, crowds and the ever growing possibility of the cops busting the place for illegal drugs.\n\nWhich brings you to your boyfriend Bobby Morningstar who naturally has suggested that you move in with him on several occasions. This would be the ideal solution if it weren\u2019t for the fact that his own family consists of like a million siblings that all live in his cult compound. There\u2019s also the fact that his ex-girlfriend/sister Diana is wicked pissed at you for stealing him away from her.\n\nIt\u2019s been an ongoing source of tension between you and Bobby and you wish he\u2019d just leave them all behind and you two could make a life together elsewhere, but his duty to family is strong, as is his faith to the Babylonian Goddess of Chaos, Tiamat which still involves human sacrifices.\n\nRight now you\u2019re having a period of separation with him. Sometimes you think about breaking up with him completely, but then you can\u2019t just dismiss the good times you do have with him. You have that special bond that only a couple could have when one warns the other about their serial killer relative lying in wait for them in the woods. Thank god Bobby took care of your uncle Ed. That had to be the scariest moment of your life dealing with that situation.\n\nOf course none of this delightful recap of past events really helps you. Kelly is starting to get very impatient with you and you fear that your months of stalling are coming to an end.\n\nKelly\u2019s currently not home, but she\u2019ll be back in a few hours to get a bit of sleep before heading off to her fight club stuff. Continuing to enjoy the time you have to not have to deal with her you go back to procrastinating, which mainly involves goofing off on the Internet, \u201cstumbling\u201d upon a porn site and then using battery powered means to relieve yourself of stress.\n\nEventually you hear the familiar slamming of the door and stomping around upstairs, which signifies that Kelly is indeed home.\n\n\u201cSUZY! Stop splittin\u2019 the kitten and get yer bony ass up here!\u201d you hear Kelly shout.\n\nYou were afraid of this. You clean yourself up a bit, mentally prepare yourself and then head upstairs.\n\n\u201cHey Kelly\u2026\u201d you start to say, but are interrupted.\n\u201cShut up. I\u2019ve got exactly a couple hours to get some rest before I have to drag my ass to my other job to support this fucking house and it\u2019s a fucking mess! You can\u2019t even clean up around here? Did you even look for a job today? Let me guess you spent the whole day fucking around on the Internet and masturbating didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell uh...\u201d\n\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ Suzy, you\u2019re goddamn useless you know that? The only reason I\u2019m not kicking your ass right now is because I need to save my energy and it would be too fucking easy.\u201d\n\nBefore you can even speak, Kelly continues her rant.\n\n\u201cGET A FUCKING JOB! I don\u2019t care what kind! Just be a contributing member of this household like Peter or get the fuck out like Donna!\u201d\n\u201cKelly I\u2019m trying, but I\u2019m just not having any luck in finding anything, can\u2019t you help me out?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHelp you out? I\u2019m helping you out right now by supporting your ass! I\u2019ve been helping you out for quite some time! In fact I originally suggested that you could probably become a ring girl at the fights, but you said no because you didn\u2019t want to dress up in skimpy clothing and parade around in front of a bunch of drunks.\u201d\n\u201cKelly, you know I don\u2019t want to dress like that in public, especially not after what uncle Ed made me wear that night\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh here we go, crazy old uncle Ed! How long you going to keep using that as an excuse? Sheesh, the way you go on about it, you act like he raped you. What happened instead? He got killed, you weren\u2019t even touched and you got a fucking boyfriend out of that deal! Some of us should be so lucky to be in a fucked up situation and STILL come out ahead! You know what I deal with on a regular basis? Steroid freaks trying to break my fucking neck that\u2019s what! You think I\u2019d be making a living trading punches with fucktards if I LOOKED like you Suzy? You got the biggest advantage and you\u2019re just wasting it! What the hell is your goddamn problem?\u201d\n\nYou can see that Kelly is in full-blown jealousy mode and shows no signs of stopping. Attempting to walk away will only result in her getting physical with you so the only thing you can do is endure the verbal assault.\n\n\u201cThis is sink or swim time sis. You either get your shit together by the end of this week or you\u2019re out on your ass! This sheltered girl act is really fucking OLD! You\u2019re a grown ass WOMAN. Start acting like one! Now get out of my fucking sight.\u201d\n\nYou meekly slink back to the basement and leave Kelly alone.\n\nYou silently mope for a while pondering what the hell you\u2019re going to do next. You then notice that your phone has been under your couch cushions and on silent all day. Bobby apparently has been repeatedly trying to contact you. Even left multiple texts saying that he really wants to talk, but the mood you\u2019re in right now, you don\u2019t want to deal with it.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to deal with anything. You just want to be safe in your own little world in the basement. How you miss those days\u2026\n\nWell today isn\u2019t completely over yet. You\u2019ve still got time to salvage some of it. Hell, maybe you can even make a major change in your life.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get help from Peter", "result": "You don\u2019t want to move out and you can\u2019t trust yourself to not get distracted as usual trying to find a job. You need help and the only other person you know that has one in the house is Peter, so you decide to go see him and hope he isn\u2019t in the middle of \u201cworking.\u201d\n\nYou head to the garage and knock on the door. From within you hear a come on in so you do so, unfortunately given Peter\u2019s state of near nakedness and a tube of KY in hand its obvious he wasn\u2019t expecting you.\n\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s you. What do you want? I got a couple of guys coming over soon and I still need to lube up.\u201d he says\n\u201cUgh\u2026I need to speak to you.\u201d You say trying not to look at him. \u201cCan you put some damn clothes on?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine, but let\u2019s hurry this up.\u201d Peter says and puts on a robe.\n\n\u201cPeter, I need your help in finding a job and before you even suggest it, no I\u2019m not going to do what you do for money.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course not. Wouldn\u2019t enter my mind to suggest such a thing to the likes of you. Which means I don\u2019t have many other suggestions for you. I mean I can only imagine you\u2019ve failed horribly at getting a normal job due to your lack of a college degree, personality quirks and crippling introversion. You don\u2019t seem to have the motivation to start your own business and for some baffling reason you don\u2019t even take advantage of the natural gifts you do have. Pfft, if I was you, I\u2019d start now because you\u2019re just getting older.\u201d\n\u201cPeter, I\u2019m not a whore. I\u2019m not going to just spread my legs to everyone for cash.\u201d\n\u201cWho said everyone? Just get one rich one, shit shouldn\u2019t be that hard for you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am, besides I have a boyfriend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho? Bobby? I thought you two broke up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, well sort of\u2026it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you need to work something out with him then and let him take care of you because while I didn\u2019t hear the whole rant, Kelly was loud enough that I made out some of it even from here. Sounds like she gave you an ultimatum.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d You say slumping into a nearby chair.\n\nPeter and you have never been close and most of the time he\u2019s annoyed you by constantly stealing your clothes in the past, but to his credit he go over and tries to console you a bit with a hug, given that his dick is still swinging out of his robe, you\u2019d rather he didn\u2019t and politely tell him you\u2019re fine.\n\n\u201cHave you tried the circus?\u201d Peter suddenly asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cThe circus. There\u2019s a small one set up a few miles west outside of town. Almost like a gypsy camp really. Remember how our family used to go together? I think it\u2019s about the only time we all got along.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I always liked the clowns the most. I liked how outgoing and happy they always were. Even thought I\u2019d grow up and be one at one point.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I think you were the only one as far as that went. I still remember you used to paint up your face with mom\u2019s make up and try to entertain Donna and me at home. Though to be quite honest all you did was scare the hell out of us.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s why I gave up that dream. Figured I was doing it wrong.\u201d You say gloomily.\n\u201cOh. Sorry about that, didn\u2019t mean to be a dream crusher.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, given my introversion I doubt if I would\u2019ve been able to actually get in front of a crowd and do it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you shouldn\u2019t have given up if that was what you wanted to do. I mean maybe you should pursue it now. I mean you don\u2019t have much to lose right and how hard could it be? Put on make up, dress up silly, and generally act creepy\u2026erm I mean goofy.\u201d\n\nPeter\u2019s words do light a certain spark in you.\n\n\u201cHmmm, maybe you\u2019re right\u2026I\u2019ll do it!\u201d you suddenly exclaim.\n\u201cGood, glad to hear you\u2019re excited about something. So are you good now? I mean I\u2019d talk more, but y\u2019know still got guys coming over and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh right, yeah I\u2019m good. Hold on, can I borrow your car to get to the circus tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cUhhh, yeah sure. Keys are over there.\u201d\n\u201cThanks again Peter.\u201d You say taking the keys and leave.\n\nYou head back down to the basement filled with excitement at the prospect of pursuing your childhood dream again! It all seems a little crazy right now, but the more you think about it the more it makes sense.\n\nYou spend the rest of the night in good spirits and maintain a positive attitude that everything will be okay tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "MONDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026our shelters are all equipped with the latest in state of the art technology, order now and\u2026\u201d\n\nClick.\n\nYou fell asleep watching tv again. Seems like they\u2019re playing those damn commercials all the time now. Nothing like praying upon people\u2019s fears due to recent world events.\n\nYou look at the time and see that you\u2019ve slept for most of the morning, but given that you\u2019re going to the circus to apply for a job you figure they will be open all night.\n\nYou also check your phone and see that Bobby\u2019s been trying to reach you, but you can\u2019t let yourself get distracted today. You need to focus on your goal of becoming a clown!\n\nYou take Peter\u2019s car and head towards the circus. The drive is fairly uneventful though one thing you notice is the increase in police cars and police in general. Apparently there\u2019s been some civil disturbance in multiple locations. You swear this one of the reasons why you never like leaving the basement in the first place. You hate the chaotic nature of people.\n\nBut then, if you have any hope of being a clown, you\u2019re going to have to get used to dealing with crowds and people. In fact you\u2019re going to have to get used to a lot of things, but you can\u2019t let yourself get a panic attack about this. You have to go through with this.\n\nEventually you arrive at your destination. Or at least you assume it is. Peter wasn\u2019t joking when he said it resembled a gypsy camp as opposed to a proper circus. You see a lot of little tents and some trailers, but nothing like a \u201cbig top.\u201d\n\nMost of the people here are dwarves and last time you knew there wasn\u2019t a large population of little people in your town, so you can only assume that they\u2019re part of the circus. In fact from what you can tell there aren\u2019t actually any customers, just carnies.\n\nAs you wander a bit, you start getting a lot of looks, you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re staring at you because you\u2019re an outsider or if they\u2019re just gawking at you. Might be a bit of both. Doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re surrounded by a lot of the little people and you start to feel like Dorothy.\n\n\u201cHey goldie with the legs, what\u2019re you doing around here? We\u2019re not open yet.\u201d One of their numbers says.\n\u201cOh, well I wasn\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m here because\u2026\u201d you take a deep breath. \u201cI want to be a clown!\u201d\n\nThat certainly wasn\u2019t the response that they were expecting. You hear a few whispers before the one that was talking speaks again.\n\n\u201cA clown? Heh, well I\u2019m not sure how successful that\u2019s going to work out for you, but luckily for you the owner of this fine circus is also a clown, so you\u2019ll need to speak with him either way. He\u2019s in the tent over there. Roofie is probably still hung over so try to speak quietly.\u201d\n\u201cRoofie?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s his clown name\u2026 actually it mean be his real name as well. Anyway, don\u2019t worry he\u2019s not a rapist or anything like that, he\u2019s just a drunk. In fact he\u2019s probably the most mentally stable clown that we\u2019ve ever had in this circus!\u201d\n\nTaking the dwarf\u2019s directions, you head over to Roofie\u2019s tent. The smell of booze is strong and when you enter you see a balding older man in oversized pants and suspenders sitting at a table holding his head in both hands. Beer and whiskey bottle are plentiful enough that you make yourself heard just by tripping over some.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it, it isn\u2019t fucking showtime and nobody\u2019s been coming anyway! Leave me alone, shit!\u201d Roofie shouts not even looking up and continuing to hold his head.\n\u201cUh Mr. Roofie, I was told to speak to you.\u201d\n\nRoofie turns and looks at you. A big red nose still on his face.\n\n\u201cHuh? Wbo the hell are you? You look way too damn classy to be any whore that I\u2019d be able to afford.\u201d\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Suzy and I want to be a clown.\u201d\n\nAt this point Roofie slowly gets up from his seat kicking a few bottles aside. You continue to stand there starting to wonder if this was such a good idea.\n\n\u201cA clown? Now why the hell would a cute blonde like you want to be a fuckin\u2019 clown. Doesn\u2019t make sense. You playin\u2019 some sort of angle honey, because I assure you I\u2019m in no mood and I ain\u2019t got any money for you to grift anyway.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s always been a life long dream ever since I was a little girl!\u201d you say and then start to go into detail of how you enjoyed circus clowns and a bunch of other life story shit that doesn\u2019t really interest Roofie. In fact he\u2019s just struggling to stand up and listen right now.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, enough! Shit. I get it. (Sigh) Look honey I dunno what to tell you, we\u2019re not exactly the Ringling Brothers here. I\u2019m also not exactly looking to hire and I barely keep this place running as it is.\u201d\n\u201cPlease let me be a clown! Just give me a chance!\u201d\n\u201cArgh, too fucking loud! Fine show me your clown stuff, just keep your voice down.\u201d\n\u201cClown stuff?\u201d\n\u201cUh yeah, like can you juggle? A little magic maybe? Some slapstick? Do you have a character like being a hobo or something? What you think it\u2019s just easy as putting on white face make up, jumping around and laughing like an idiot?\u201d\n\u201cWell sort of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSheesh. That\u2019s the kind of thinking that makes us look creepy rather than amusing. You do realize that most people hate clowns right? Doesn\u2019t help that we\u2019re constantly vilified in horror movies nowadays. Yer wastin\u2019 my time and yours if you don\u2019t even know the basics.\u201d\n\nRoofie isn\u2019t exactly inspiring your confidence in this anymore. You feel like just heading home, but can\u2019t run from this like you do with everything else, you\u2019ve got no other options! You start to break down in tears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know the basics, but I\u2019ll work hard! (Sob) I\u2019m serious about this! (Sob) I\u2019ve tried to get a job everywhere else and if I don\u2019t get this, I\u2019ll get kicked out of my house! This is my last chance! (Sob)\u201d you exclaim in between the tears.\n\u201cLast chance? Darling, if bein\u2019 a clown is your last chance, then you\u2019ve got some major problems. (Sigh) I dunno even know why I\u2019m entertaining this save for the fact that you\u2019re easy on the eyes even without the need for alcohol and I\u2019m a sucker for a damsel in distress. Besides if the news is any indication, we\u2019re all gonna be dead by nuclear fire soon anyway, so fuck it. All right, stop yer weepin\u2019 an maybe we can do something with you.\u201d\n\nYou clear up your eyes a bit completely oblivious to Roofie\u2019s brief doomsday expectations.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll help train me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, hopefully you\u2019ll pick up something in time, but I\u2019m not going to bother with regular training, you\u2019re going to learn trial by fire which all good clowns do anyway. Now the greatest thing going for you is that you\u2019re cute, so I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 we create a character for you that utilizes your, shall we say natural talent.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m not going to have my breasts exposed while wearing nothing but red clown noses on my nipples do I?\u201d you ask with concern.\n\u201c(Snort) Jesus girl. No, nuthin\u2019 like that.\u201d Roofie chuckles \u201cYou\u2019ll be fully clothed, though you\u2019ll still be cute lookin\u2019. Kinda like that one girl. Y\u2019know in the funny books? The one with that rich vigilante. Anyway, the key thing to remember is you need to act cutesy. That\u2019s going to be your character. You\u2019ll be a cute clown while all the other clowns around you hilariously fail to try to win you over, hit each other with mallets and all that sort of shit\u2026hmmm, this is actually sounding like a pretty good skit. I\u2019m going to go round up the others and have a run through. In the meantime there\u2019s a bunch of clown outfits in the trunk over there. Fairly certain we got a bunch of unused girly ones that should fit you. Some make up over and a mirror over there. Don\u2019t worry about getting that just right for now since I know the lighting sucks in this tent. And uh, I dunno try to practice acting demure and shy.\u201d\n\nRoofie leaves the tent and you\u2019re left realizing that you might just succeed at getting this job! You quickly go through the trunk and find some pink and black-checkered leotard thing with a mini-skirt attached around the waist. It fits and fortunately while form fitting, it isn\u2019t excessively tight, though your legs are still exposed so you put on some knee high purple striped leggings. You feel sort of vulnerable undressing in a tent that someone could just enter at any time, but fortunately there\u2019s at least a privacy-screen you can dress behind.\n\nYou complete your look by putting your hair in girlish pigtails and applying a bunch of white face make up on and making your eyelashes and lips stand out with black eye liner and red lipstick.\n\nYou haven\u2019t had time to practice when Roofie returns with a bunch of other men in various clown outfits. One of them is even a little person like you met out front.\n\n\u201cGoddamn Roofie, I think I\u2019m gonna have to rethink my plans of leaving your shitty carnival.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cLeave? Hell, I think I\u2019m in love.\u201d Says another before Roofie speaks up.\n\n\u201cHoly shit girl, I said cute clown, not harlequin seductress! You might need to tone it down in the future we\u2019re still trying to run a family show more or less. All right never mind, let\u2019s run through this and you guys TRY to remember to keep your tongues in your mouth on occasion.\u201d\n\nSo you run through the routine while Roofie gives everyone directions. At first you naturally feel a little unready and uneasy what with everyone flirting with you, but soon you start to get into the swing of things. In fact it starts to come easy, you bat your eyes, give a few girlish giggles when someone slips and falls trying to give you a balloon flower and similar things.\n\nEventually Roofie stops everyone and says the skit needs to be refined a bit, but it should work. He then tells everyone to leave since he wants speak with you privately. This seems to disappoint the others who all continue to stare at you while leaving.\n\n\u201cWell, other than the fact that I could tell some of them were having a really hard time in not actually groping you, I\u2019d say that went well and even you seem to have gotten into character quickly. Maybe you do have what it takes after all. You still seem a little nervous though, which sort of helped your performance, but I\u2019d rather you remain at ease. Anything that can help with that?\u201d Roofie asks.\n\u201cWell its like you said, I partially felt like one of them was going to jump on me at any given time. I mean is that something I\u2019m going to have to worry about?\u201d\n\u201cNah, that won\u2019t happen. We carnies have a rule against hurting each other. I mean I won\u2019t lie that they aren\u2019t going to stare a lot at you and most likely a few are going to make crude comments, but that\u2019s about as far as it is going to go if you decide to join and stay with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to join?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still interested, sure. I think you\u2019ve got something to offer. Though like I said, I\u2019m still not sure why someone like you would want to join a broken down circus like this one. I still think someone like you would be a model or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m wearing an outlandish outfit, my face is all painted up and a bunch of guys are falling over themselves just to get a look at me. Seems like I\u2019m doing the same thing as a model save for the eating disorder.\u201d\n\nYour comment causes a laugh from Roofie.\n\n\u201cHa ha! That\u2019s pretty good. I think I\u2019m making the right decision. Okay, so about your sleeping arrangements, I might have to re-arrange some folks and that\u2019s always going to cause problems, so you might have to sleep in your car for tonight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait you want me to move in here?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah. I mean I told you we weren\u2019t going to be staying here too much longer and you have to know that circus\u2019 do tend to travel right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right. Of course. It\u2019s just, heh, I guess when I jumped into this I didn\u2019t think all of it through. Though that\u2019s probably obvious.\u201d\n\u201cHrm, well it\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m not gonna lie and say this life is the easiest and if you feel more comfortable at home or have loved ones you don\u2019t want to leave that\u2019s understandable.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno if I\u2019d say all that, but the concept of leaving my home\u2026well it\u2019s a bit of a big change for me. Like a VERY big one. And oddly, this opportunity has me seriously considering it.\u201d\n\u201cWell you do what\u2019s in your heart. Anyway, we aren\u2019t leaving today or even tomorrow, so I mean if you want to go back home and pick up some stuff, say goodbye to whoever, then you\u2019ve got time. But even though we\u2019re not leaving tomorrow we are going to be open for our last show and I\u2019ll need you here. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll at least get some people here and make at least a bit of money before picking up stakes and all that.\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what to do. The logical thing to do would be to go back home and gather some belonging, say a few goodbyes and try to convince Peter to drive you back up here so he gets his car back.\n\nBut there\u2019s something within you that wonders if you shouldn\u2019t just make a clean break immediately and stay. You know yourself and if you get back home you\u2019re likely find some reason to stay and back out of this opportunity. You think about Bobby and how he\u2019d be one of those reasons. You still haven\u2019t called him back.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay at the circus", "result": "If you\u2019re going to do this, you need to be all in right now. You feel slightly bad about essentially stealing Peter\u2019s car, but you figure you can call him later and he can get someone to drive him over to pick it up. (Assuming he doesn\u2019t call you first)\n\nAs for Bobby you\u2019re not going to bother. You\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you and he have too many differences to make it work and that this final break up has been a long time coming. Calling him would just make you fall for his charms and hinder your own goals and you can\u2019t have that happen.\n\n\u201cMr. Roofie, I\u2019ll be staying.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, great. We\u2019ll be opening up soon, dunno if anyone\u2019s actually going to show up, but you might as well get out there and wander around to make this place look festive.\u201d\n\u201cDid you want me to change, you said something about this outfit being too much?\u201d\n\u201cEh\u2026don\u2019t bother. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s an appropriate look for you. Like I said, you might have to put up with some cat calling from some of the cruder employees here, but that\u2019s about it. And if anyone starts getting out of line with you, be they carnie or rube, let me know about it. Trust me it\u2019ll be taken care of immediately. This carnival might be on its last legs, but I\u2019ll be damned if it\u2019ll descend into anarchy. My dad didn\u2019t work and sacrifice all those years for nothing.\u201d Roofie says.\n\u201cYour dad owned this carnival? Was he a clown too?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, no. He was a geek and I don\u2019t mean in the lovable nerd sense either. I mean he was a bonafide circus geek. Ate all manner of disgusting things to bring in the customers. Raw animal organs, heads of chickens, rotten food, you name it. He always told me though he was drunk most of the time so it wasn\u2019t quite as bad as you\u2019d think. Fortunately he didn\u2019t stay a circus geek though. Apparently he helped the original ringmaster with something very important and after that happened my dad got a better job around here as the ringmaster\u2019s assistant.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he help the ringmaster with?\u201d\n\u201cDunno exactly. Like I said, my dad was drinking a lot heavier during those geek days. He said it had to do with a power struggle within the circus, but he couldn\u2019t quite remember all the details. In any event when the original ring master one day decided it was time to move on to something else my dad got control of the circus. Kept it going too despite the changing times. I\u2019ve tried to follow in his footsteps, but so far the only thing I\u2019ve succeeded at is the drinking part.\u201d\n\nRoofie takes a drink from a nearby bottle after this statement.\n\n\u201cSo, uh what made you become a clown?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, I was trying to help out I guess. Y\u2019see my dad had to raise me himself since my mom died giving birth to me and I guess when I got old enough I felt I should contribute for all the extra burden I put on him.\u201d\n\u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well all I know about her is that she was a runaway that joined up with the circus shortly after my dad took over as owner. Anyway, for a while, this circus didn\u2019t have a single clown. Apparently it did a long time ago, but my dad said there were some horror stories about them and they were eventually\u2026let go. Despite this circus\u2019 odd apprehension about having clowns again I convinced my dad that it would be a good idea to have clowns. So he gave me a shot and it worked. Rest is history, anyway that\u2019s enough story time you\u2019ve got your own clown work to do, so get to it.\u201d\n\nYou take your leave and re-assure that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to keep people entertained.\n\nNo sooner have you left Roofie\u2019s tent when you\u2019re nabbed by a couple of the other clowns, this time they\u2019re full clown uniform.\n\n\u201cHey tulip we\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for ya. If you\u2019re staying, we\u2019re going to need to polish up our routine.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cYeah, and after that, you can polish something else. Ha ha ha ha ha!\u201d says another which causes some snickering from the others.\n\u201cCould you please not talk that way to me?\u201d you ask politely.\n\u201cAwww are you sensitive? You\u2019re such a delicate pretty little flower aren\u2019t you?\u201d the clown who made the polishing comment says.\n\u201cSheesh, Ranko don\u2019t be a fucking asshole. Don\u2019t mind him sweetheart he\u2019s never been this close to a woman before.\u201d Another clown says.\n\u201cFuck you Klepto and stop playing white knight. You\u2019re not foolin\u2019 anyone. You know damn well you got a raging boner for this little blonde number too. Am I right fellas?\u201d\n\nThis gets a small positive acknowledgement by the other clowns, including Klepto who chuckles while confessing his transparent white knighting. Once again you\u2019re starting to wonder if this is going to be worth it.\n\nIs this what its always going to be like? You haven\u2019t even been officially an employee five minutes and you\u2019re already getting subjected to dirty innuendo and harassment. You know Roofie tried to assure you that nothing is going happen and that if someone did try anything you could let him know, but really though you don\u2019t want to have to feel like you have to go running to him like a tattletale every time.\n\nIf you could brave your serial killer uncle and your cultist ex-boyfriend, you can certainly handle some loutish clowns. In fact you start thinking about all the times Kelly has verbally abused you and you begin to get angry. You channel some of that anger that you have for her and direct it towards your new co-workers.\n\n\u201cRanko, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s your name due to the bad breath your giving off right now. It smells like shit which still makes it about two steps higher than you look.\u201d You say, which catches him off guard and stops the others from laughing. Before Ranko can retort you continue.\n\n\u201cYour name oughta be Zero, because that\u2019s exactly how far you\u2019re ever going to get with me. The same goes for the rest of you fucktards! Just because I\u2019m new here doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m just going to take your fucking abuse!\u201d\n\nFor a moment there\u2019s silence and even some of the nearby employees look on wondering what the rest a going to do. Ranko is the only one who says anything though.\n\n\u201cHmm, looks like the delicate flower has a few thorns. That\u2019s okay though. I like a little spirit, keeps things interesting. In any case we still need to go over the routine so if you\u2019re done bitching at all of us, let\u2019s go.\u201d He says and motions everyone to follow.\n\nYou\u2019re slightly apprehensive about following this group anywhere, but there\u2019s little else for it since these are going to be your coworkers. You can only hope that in time they\u2019ll see you as something other than an outlet for their lust.\n\nAs you walk to the location you scan the rest of the carnival, which mostly consists of a lot of game barker types setting up their crooked games. You do see a few stages where the more traditional sword swallower and fire eater types are preparing themselves. This being a circus and the fact that Roofie said his father was a geek, you can\u2019t help but wonder if there are any \u201cfreaks\u201d anywhere.\n\n\u201cHey just wondering are their any Siamese Twins around here or something?\u201d you ask trying to break up the silence.\n\u201cSiamese Twins? Way to be racist darlin\u2019. Ha ha, nah just fuckin\u2019 with ya, but I believe the correct term is conjoined twins and no we don\u2019t have any. There haven\u2019t been any freaks in this carnival for decades now. I heard back in the day there were a lot of them here though. Cyclopes, pinheads, four arms abominations of nature, you name it.\u201d Ranko remarks.\n\u201cHow come there aren\u2019t any here anymore?\u201d\n\u201cWell because we live in a developed country that has access to modern medicine nowadays? I mean most of those freaks were just unlucky bastards that rolled low on the genetics chart when they were born. Thanks to modern medicine they can correct that shit now y\u2019know? Plus you\u2019ve got all those politically correct types going on about exploitation or some shit. Also if someone IS a genetic freak of nature they can just go on a talk show or the Internet and make money that way. Nope, the time of the sideshow freak has long since passed. I mean sure you get the self made freaks like tattooed and pierced folks, but that\u2019s not really the same and it isn\u2019t even shocking anymore especially when you\u2019ve got people cutting their dicks off or shoving glass jars up their ass for free on the net. The best you\u2019re going to get around here to freaks are the midgets and they\u2019re a dime a dozen, no offense Shrimpy.\u201d Ranko says referring to the dwarf clown.\n\u201cFuck you too Ranko.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\nSoon you get to an open location near a couple trailers where Ranko says you\u2019re all going to go through the routine. It\u2019s pretty much like how you first went through it, but you notice several of the clowns are getting a little bit more grabby now.\n\n\u201cAlright, stop, stop. You assholes are supposed to be trying to woo me and fighting with each other, not attempting to gang rape me! I feel one more hand trying to grab my ass and they\u2019re losing it!\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake according to you whatever we do is offensive. I\u2019m just thinking of a way to keep the routine fresh. It\u2019ll be funny!\u201d Ranko says.\n\u201cFresh? We haven\u2019t even performed it for people yet! Besides isn\u2019t this supposed to be a family show? The way Roofie suggested will be fine.\u201d\n\u201cThat old drunk doesn\u2019t even perform anymore, he\u2019s too busy running this carnival into the fucking ground. He\u2019s so fucking out of touch its ridiculous. Kids these days are watching hardcore anal porn as soon as they can log on to the Internet nowadays, so I doubt if a couple of clowns grabbing your ass is even going to register.\u201d Ranko says.\n\nAt this point Ranko is starting to get more hostile. Your continued defiance of not wanting to be a squeeze toy is getting to him. Despite Roofie being the owner, it\u2019s obvious that this Ranko is the \u201cring leader\u201d of the clowns and he\u2019s going to be a dick no matter what. Continuing to antagonize his authority is going to just result in unifying the rest to his side, so you try something else.\n\n\u201cAll right Ranko, you want this routine to incorporate a little more risqu\u00e9 business fine, but you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You\u2019ve got no style.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Only been a clown for a few hours and you\u2019re already an expert eh? Well go on and enlighten us all then sweetheart.\u201d\n\u201cWell for one thing Shrimpy should be trying to look under my dress whenever he can due to his size.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait what?\u201d Ranko asks.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m liking her ideas already!\u201d Shrimpy exclaims.\n\u201cYou all still need to play to your traits, don\u2019t you see? You, Lifto. You\u2019re the biggest of the lot so you should be relying on feats of strength in order to impress me like picking me up in your arms.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d Lifto remarks.\n\nYou go through what the rest of the clowns should be doing and they\u2019re remarkably receptive to you and your ideas. You come up with a whole new routine where they each attempt to charm you and how they fail either due to their own ineptness or another clown sabotaging them. The only one who\u2019s not liking this idea is Ranko.\n\n\u201cHey, hey, hey, what about me? Where do I fit in?\u201d Ranko demands.\n\u201cYou? Well I figured you\u2019d be that completely disgusting suitor that never even gets close to being charming seeing as you\u2019re already pretty good in that role. You can be an ongoing participant that gets constantly beat down by the others. Lifto hits you with a mallet, Klepto steals your pants, Shrimpy gives you a hot foot\u2026you know clown stuff. It\u2019ll be funny.\u201d You say snidely much to Ranko\u2019s chagrin.\n\u201cOh no, you\u2019re not turning my crew against me! I\u2019M head clown around here not some bottle blonde split tail! We\u2019re not agreeing to this shit!\u201d Ranko shouts.\n\u201cSpeak for yourself Ranko.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cYeah, I kinda like this idea better, my bit doesn\u2019t seem to rely on as much movement on my part.\u201d Fatty remarks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed that a newbie took your idea and made it work against you.\u201d Shrimpy adds.\n\nRanko at this point begins ranting and raving at everyone. He unleashed a torrent of swears that causes the whole carnival to take notice. He calls you a bitch and the rest of them pussy whipped.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m done with this fucking loser carnival and the rest of you losers as well! I\u2019m fucking RANKO the goddamn clown! I can get a job anywhere! Enjoy living in obscurity with miss frigid over here!\u201d Ranko exclaims and storms off in a huff.\n\n\u201cGood riddance rank breath! And I\u2019m a goddamn natural blonde, you asshole!\u201d you shout as he continues to walk away.\n\nYou have to say this plunge into assertiveness has given you a bit of a rush. You like it. When you go back to going through the routine with the others and you notice a decrease in your former uneasiness. The \u201cboys\u201d are still doing a lot of leering and the routine is a little more physical now, but something is different this time. Namely you feel more in control of the situation and that\u2019s probably because you are.\n\n\u201cWow, I really was wasting my natural talent.\u201d You think to yourself.\n\nIn the middle of the routine, Roofie shows up.\n\n\u201cWell this looks\u2026friendly.\u201d He remarks as Lifto is in the middle of setting you back down on the ground.\n\u201cJust going through the tweaked routine boss. It was the new girl\u2019s idea!\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d Shrimpy adds.\n\u201cHrm. Well let\u2019s at least try to keep everyone\u2019s clothing on shall we?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! There isn\u2019t going to be any of that. Just going to keep it entertaining for the adult audience too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t help notice Ranko swearing like a sailor and stomping away from the carnival. Ranting about how he\u2019s never coming back. You wouldn\u2019t know anything about that would you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really boss. He just couldn\u2019t keep up with the recent changes around here I guess.\u201d You say,\n\nRoofie smirks a bit.\n\n\u201cHeh, okay. Well I\u2019m not going to lose any sleep not having to pay that asshole anymore. In any case, saw a few people actually driving up. Look like actual customers, so you guys need to go do your stuff for the crowds.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the day goes pretty well for you. You and the rest entertain the small crowds (who seem to be mostly from the trailer park community just outside of your town.) that do show up.\n\nBy the end of the night you\u2019re actually pretty tired and anxious to just flop down somewhere to sleep. Roofie says that thanks to Ranko leaving, his trailer is now empty and says that you can have it if you\u2019re willing to ignore the mess he probably left it in. You accept the offer since it\u2019ll be better than sleeping in Peter\u2019s car.\n\nAnd its at that point you forgot to call Peter back to let him know to pick his car up!\nYou check your phone and see that Peter did indeed try to get a hold of you, and once again Bobby left a bunch of texts and messages as well. You\u2019re too tired to even bother to read them.\n\nYou try to call Peter back, but you get no answer. Probably doing god knows what. You\u2019ll try again tomorrow, for now you enter Ranko\u2019s trailer and breathe a sigh of relief that the place isn\u2019t a health hazard and lie down on his bed.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep you chuckle at the irony that Ranko wanted to get you into his bed really badly and all it took was for him to leave.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "TUESDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026remember time is running out! Our shelters won\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\n\nYou wake up to instinctively to grab the remote to turn off the TV only to realize that you have no TV, yet you\u2019re still hearing those damn Ground Zero commercials.\n\nYou groggily sit up and look out a side window and see one of the carnies holding a radio, which is loudly playing one of those advertisements.\n\nJust as well you\u2019re up anyway, now that you have actual responsibilities and will have to live these new people you should take this opportunity to meet everyone since despite getting acquainted with your co-workers and the boss, you didn\u2019t really interact with anyone else working here.\n\nStill dressed in your outfit from yesterday (mainly because you lack anything else to wear right now) you go out and meet your brand new family full of hope that this will be the start of something wonderful!\n\nThe reality turns out to be much different though.\n\n\u201cHoney, why the hell are hanging around with those clowns? I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be better as a sword swallower; in fact I got a way you can practice if you come to my trailer right now!\u201d\n\u201cHey clown girl, I\u2019ve got a way to paint your face white without the need for make up!\u201d\n\u201cNice tits!\u201d\n\nThe female carnies aren\u2019t much better.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the new girl that got her own private trailer huh? Guess a blowjob gets you a lot preference nowadays. Was Roofie even sober at the time?\u201d\n\u201cHey Bozo the Hoe, you think you\u2019re hot shit wiggling your ass at everyone? Let me warn you right now, you take my man I\u2019ll make sure you won\u2019t need to wear a red clown nose at your next performance!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any extra clothes you can borrow, Miss Living Skeleton. Go away you anorexic bitch.\u201d\n\nLife is never easy outside the basement is it Suzy?\n\nUnfortunately that part of your life is over. You could go back to your trailer and hide you suppose, but it\u2019s not the same and besides you\u2019ve already come to the conclusion that hiding won\u2019t solve your problems.\n\nStill, you are feeling a little \u201cganged up\u201d on so for temporary relief you return to currently the only people that are halfway decent to you now, your fellow clowns.\n\nYou enter the clown tent and see them all sitting around talking about something, but then when you enter all their attention is turned towards you.\n\n\u201cOh hey Suzy, you\u2019re here early. We don\u2019t usually warm up until a few hours before showtime.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not here for that, I\u2019m just here since half of the carnival seems to want to fuck me and barrage me with clumsy sexual innuendo.\u201c\n\u201cAnd\u2026 you came here to get away from that?\u201d Lifto asks.\n\nYou chuckle a little.\n\n\u201cYeah well at least if I stay in here part of it will be work related.\u201d You answer which causes a couple of laughs and smiles from the rest.\n\u201cWell considering you are one of us, maybe we should go easier on that now.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cI\u2019d certainly appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cHey there are a lot of other women who work here, maybe you could go bond with them and do that whole sisterhood thing?\u201d Lifto says.\n\u201cI tried that. They all insulted me and seemed to want to punch me. Well except for that woman with the short red hair that juggles knives. I think she wanted to punch AND fuck me. (Sigh) No, looks like you guys are my only tribe here for now.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well get used to it I guess. Nobody likes us clowns that much. To be quite honest one of the reasons we decided to knock off the crude remarks toward you is because you\u2019ll be the first new person in years that will be civil to us. No point in making new enemies.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cReally? I thought all carnies stuck together.\u201d You say.\n\nNow all the rest of the clowns laugh.\n\n\u201cHardly. I mean yeah there\u2019s a certain unspoken rule that carnies stay united against outsiders and rubes. And we aren\u2019t supposed to kill one another, but\u2026well lets just say this very carnival doesn\u2019t exactly have a spotless track record in that regard.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cPeople kill each other here?\u201d you ask a bit alarmed.\n\u201cNo! Well not in my time anyway\u2026\u201d Klepto remarks trailing off.\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean? Look I don\u2019t want to be part of some murder circus!\u201d\n\u201cDamn it Klepto you\u2019ve scared the girl now! You should\u2019ve just kept your mouth shut!\u201d Shrimpy exclaims.\n\nAt this point the clowns begin arguing with each other, but after a few moments of this bickering you demand that someone explain the situation exactly. Once again Klepto takes it upon himself to be the storyteller.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve probably blown it all out of proportion, but there are stories of how back in the day before Roofie or even his dad owned this carnival there was a violent power struggle for control over it that resulted in a lot of dead bodies afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t just stories, shit it happened! My family has been a fixture of this carnival for generations too and my grandfather told me about the blood that ran during that fateful day.\u201d Shrimpy adds as if Klepto didn\u2019t quite put as much stock in these stories and takes over as the storyteller.\n\n\u201cBattle lines were drawn that day. I mean you had dwarves, normals and freaks all siding against each other and the most hated group out of the bunch? The clowns. Now from what my grandfather told me, these clowns were definitely the reason why everyone today thinks of them as being monsters under the beds nowadays. Things of course have changed since then, but as they say the more things change the more they stay the same.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m saying there\u2019s going to be another power struggle soon and given that we\u2019re clowns, WE are going to be on the losing end no matter what happens\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, what about Roofie? I mean isn\u2019t he one of us?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cRoofie? The fact that he\u2019s a clown just makes everyone think we already get preferential treatment. He\u2019ll probably be the first one killed being the owner and all. He\u2019s old and doesn\u2019t have nearly the amount of control he used to anymore. Nope, I believe the change will be coming soon and it\u2019ll be truly be a dark day for clowns\u2026well maybe I\u2019ll be able to get my people to take me back and YOU can offer to be someone\u2019s girlfriend, but the rest of you are fucked.\u201d\n\u201cGee, glad to know we\u2019ll be able to count on your support Shrimpy, if something does happen.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\nYou never realized that carnie \u201cpolitics\u201d was so complex and dangerous. Before you can panic too much about it Roofie shows up with a bottle in his hand.\n\n\u201cHey, what\u2019re you lot still doing in here? We\u2019ve actually got people showing up early. Apparently your little routine yesterday got people at that trailer park talking and they brought all the rest of their redneck buddies. Looks like we\u2019ll get to rake in one goodly amount of cash before leaving this place. Oh and Suzy, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the car you drove up in? Well looks like it was vandalized in the night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cAll the tires were slashed and someone wrote cunt all over it with face make up. It might be just a hunch, but I\u2019d say Ranko felt like he needed to have to last word.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Great.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell anyway you all need to get out there and do what you do.\u201d Roofie orders and leaves.\n\nWhile the rest get going, you remain sitting starting to worry about what you\u2019ve got yourself into. Once again you start to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just leave until Klepto touches your shoulder.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Suzy, Shrimpy has been going on like that for as long as I\u2019ve known him. While things get tense around here at times, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come to some bloodbath. Besides you can\u2019t spend your life worrying about the future, gotta live for the day I say, so let\u2019s just take our minds off our troubles by putting on a good show.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\nWhile Klepto\u2019s reassurance is nice, it doesn\u2019t really alleviate your concerns. Hell, you can\u2019t even leave if you wanted to given that Peter\u2019s car is trashed. You can only hope that perhaps in time peoples\u2019 attitudes towards you will soften a bit. Right now, you do have work to focus on.\n\nRoofie wasn\u2019t lying when he said more people showed up today. You and the rest of the clowns spend a majority of the afternoon walking around keeping the people entertained\n\nEventually you take a break and decide to check out Peter\u2019s car and if it is at all salvageable. When you get to it, it\u2019s exactly as Roofie said, all four tires slashed and the word cunt painted all over it. You can\u2019t believe nobody saw any of this even during the night. Or maybe they did and didn\u2019t give a shit considering you haven\u2019t exactly been accepted by most here.\n\nIn any event you try to call Peter again, but you get no answer. He hasn\u2019t even tried to call you. He must really be involved with work or something. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t give a shit about his car. He could easily afford a new one. You also notice Bobby hasn\u2019t tried calling you either. You guess he got the hint.\n\nYou attempt to start to the car and just as you suspected Ranko must\u2019ve sabotaged the engine or something under the hood as well. No matter, when you leave you weren\u2019t going to be driving this thing anymore anyway. Lacking anymore use for the car, you take a look in the trunk just to see what might be in there and that\u2019s when you find something useful. Namely a bunch of clothes\u2026specifically YOUR clothes! Well some of them anyway.\n\nApparently Peter still had a lot of your old clothes that he stole from you in the past. The other stuff looks like S&M garb, though not all of it the traditional black leather or latex. Some of it is sort of colorful. Festive even.\n\nWell at least you won\u2019t be walking around in the same stuff day in day out now. You pack up what you can and head back to your trailer to drop it off. Afterwards you find the rest of your new clown \u201cfamily\u201d and eat with them. You take the opportunity to tell them a little bit about your former life; you get a surprising amount of sympathy from the others.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, I thought I came from a fucked up family.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cYeah well, like I said I did a lot of hiding in the basement for the most part. Not much of a life I guess, but it kept me sane for the most part.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey, whatever helps you survive the day right?\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\nAfter a bit more chatting you all get back to work.\n\nAs time goes on, there is one person you keep seeing nearby throughout the day, a large man in overalls who while attempting to look like he\u2019s NOT staring at you, obviously is. This isn\u2019t the usual ogling either because you\u2019ve gotten accustomed to that, you\u2019re getting a really creepy vibe from this guy.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should get Roofie to throw this guy out or something.\u201d You say.\n\u201cRoofie? I just passed by one of the tents when I got another snack and saw he\u2019s currently passed out as usual. Besides, he never throws anyone out as long as they aren\u2019t doing something violent. As far a he\u2019s concerned every low life that visits this carnival is a potential mark and worth putting up with to get their money.\u201d Fatty says.\n\u201cThe guy looks like a retard. He\u2019s probably not used to seeing a girl as beautiful as you before. I mean even under the white face make up and clown clothing, you still look miles better than any of the trailer trash mothers that have come here with their spawn.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cWell he\u2019s really fucking creepy and I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything in broad daylight, and even if he does, you know we got your back. Just stick near us and Lifto look extra intimidating.\u201d Klepto says.\n\nThe night the crowds start thinning out a bit. You imagine that after they put their illegitimate spawn to bed, trailer trash prefers to spend their nights at bars, strip clubs and getting high and/or drunk at home. As for the big retard that was staring at you all day, he seems to have left as well, but you still feel uneasy.\n\nMeanwhile Roofie has reawakened from his temporary drunken stupor to tell everyone that today was a good day and that everyone should get some rest since you\u2019re going to be packing this place down first thing tomorrow morning and moving on. He then mumbles something about it all being pointless anyway and staggers back to his own trailer.\n\n\u201cWell looks like that\u2019s it. See you tomorrow Suzy.\u201d Klepto remarks as he and the rest head towards their trailer.\n\nYou on the other hand are still a little nervous about going back to yours.\n\n\u201cUh, guys do you think I could sleep with you tonight?\u201d you say which causes all of them to turn back towards you in disbelief.\n\u201cWow Ranko would have had a field day with that remark.\u201d Klepto chuckles. \u201cYou know probably nothing is going to happen. That guy was just some goony retard. Hell, if the freak show still existed, he\u2019d probably be one of the side shows here.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m just still feeling really on edge about that guy from earlier. I mean I could sleep on the floor, I don\u2019t care.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat would be incredibly uncomfortable and probably quite disgusting. Our trailer isn\u2019t exactly the cleanest. I mean I\u2019d offer my bed, but given that we\u2019re going to need all our energy to pack up tomorrow, I\u2019d like to get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I sleep over in your trailer?\u201d Lifto asks. \u201cI know Ranko\u2019s trailer is big enough for one other person. I could stay over, you guys would get a little extra room tonight and you can sleep safely without worry.\u201d\n\u201cHrmm, that\u2019s\u2026generous of you Lifto.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m just offering a solution.\u201d Lifto says though it does seem like he might be hoping this act of chivalry will lead to something more.\n\nWhile you\u2019d hate to cause hard feelings within the group or possibly lead someone on, you know one thing is certain; you still don\u2019t want to sleep alone tonight.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take up Lifto\u2019s offer", "result": "The more you think about it, the idea of sleeping in possibly cramped quarters isn\u2019t exactly appealing, not to mention Klepto said the place wasn\u2019t the cleanest. If you lay down the law to Lifto, you\u2019re fairly certain he won\u2019t try anything.\n\n\u201cOkay Lifto, get your stuff, you can stay over, but I think you know I don\u2019t need to tell you to not try anything.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Really, it\u2019ll be nice just to stay some place less crowded for a change.\u201d Lifto remarks and goes to trailer to get whatever it is he\u2019s going to need for the night.\n\nKlepto looks a little disappointed, but says nothing and just meekly heads back to his trailer as well. You already can imagine how rumors are going to spread, but you really can\u2019t worry about that now. You\u2019re not going to worry about possible \u201churt\u201d feelings especially when you\u2019re not involved with anyone here anyway.\n\nLifto and you soon head over to your trailer.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t really had a chance to completely clean up since I was given the place.\u201d You mention.\n\u201cStill cleaner than our place, and I\u2019ve been over here a couple times when Ranko had it. Trust me it\u2019s starting to look better already.\u201d\n\u201c(Yawn) Thanks. Man, didn\u2019t realize I was getting so sleeping so quickly. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cSure. I\u2019m probably going to be awake for a little while longer, and eventually sleep on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re going to be okay? I mean I know you have to sleep as well.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of a light sleeper, so even when I do fall asleep, I\u2019ll easily be able to wake up if someone even tries to pick the lock and creep in here. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nYou settle down to sleep and speak about a few superficial things to Lifto about how you think you\u2019re fitting in here and how you\u2019re glad he\u2019s staying here the night. He of course is very positive and tries to reassure you that it\u2019ll just take awhile, but eventually the rest of the carnies will accept you.\n\nYou aren\u2019t inclined to believe that, but it\u2019s nice to hear before you fall asleep.\n\nAt some point in the night you\u2019re awakened by Lifto noisily rushing to the door.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d you utter still half asleep.\n\u201cSuzy, stay where you are, some motherfucker\u2019s trying to break in!\u201d he shouts and with some sort of blunt object in hand he slams the door open. It doesn\u2019t sound like he hit the person with the door, but you do hear a scuffle outside.\n\nYou look out the window and see who Lifto is fighting with and it\u2019s an equally large man. It\u2019s same creepy retard that was staring at you all day today. You knew it wasn\u2019t going to be safe to be here alone.\n\nYou quickly look around for a weapon of your own to help Lifto. Hopefully with all the noise someone else from the carnival will come running to help. (You hope)\n\nGrabbing a knife you cautiously head towards the door still hearing the fighting between Lifto and the retarded hick. You open the door and see them both rolling on the ground. You can\u2019t really help due to the retard not being still enough for you to be confident to stab at him, not to mention you\u2019re really scared about this whole situation.\n\nNobody is out to help out either. You call out a couple times and you know it has to be loud enough for SOMEONE to hear now, but its like you\u2019re not being helped on purpose.\n\nLifto and the retard are really going at it and unfortunately it\u2019s starting to look like the retard is getting the upper hand. You really don\u2019t want to leave, but you figure the best you can do is to go get help from the other clowns.\n\nYou turn to run and you manage to get to the end of your trailer, before someone trips you to the ground in the dark followed by a blunt object smashing you in the back of the head. You go unconscious immediately.\n\nWhen you wake up, you\u2019re groggy, naked and firmly strapped to a medical gurney of some sort. You also have a ball gag in your mouth. The room you\u2019re in looks to be some sort of basement with a bright light hanging overhead.\n\nThe stench of chemicals fills the air and to your left in a darker corner of the room you see a man in a doctor\u2019s coat hovering over another gurney with a body on it.\n\nNaturally in such a state you start to panic and ineffectively struggle to get free. The \u201cdoctor\u201d hears you and walks over to you.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re up. I\u2019ll have to give you more sedative. When Jed and Hugo brought you in, I thought you were going to be a useless slab of meat like they normally bring in. I was glad they showed some restraint this time. Honestly I\u2019m very surprised they just didn\u2019t keep you themselves and have some good ol\u2019 fashioned fun or at least a quick in out before handing you over, but Jed did mention something about having to haul ass from your carnival as quick as possible.\u201d\n\nAs you continue to try to struggle and make muted sounds to cry out, the doctor begins fondling you and moving his hands to roam all over your body.\n\n\u201cMmmm, nice. Not as great as my sister, but then none of them ever are. If I had the time, I\u2019d probably shove it in your vertical smile for a while, but sadly I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe doctor goes over to a tray and grabs some sort of syringe he fully intends on use on you and you\u2019ve gone from mere panic to sheer terror.\n\n\u201cReally, you\u2019re luckier than most that come through here. Normally I keep \u2018em awake when I do my work, but I need you unconscious to take out those pretty eyes and other vital organs of yours. Wouldn\u2019t want you thrashing about or blinking to cause me to cut them all up and making them useless.\u201d\n\nYou watch helplessly as the needle goes into your arm. The tears run down your cheeks.\n\n\u201cThere we go. Won\u2019t be long now. (Sigh) I swear it seems like I never get to enjoy my work any more though. I really would\u2019ve liked to have fun with you. Oh well, I\u2019ve got some other things to still look forward to.\u201d\n\nYou drift into unconsciousness again and your life ends where you ironically spent most of your time.\n\nA basement.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stick with your idea", "result": "Lifto might mean well, but you\u2019d rather stick with your original plan.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to feel safe in my trailer until we leave the damn area, so I still want to sleep in your trailer.\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay but I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s going to be crowded and like I said that floor isn\u2019t something you want to sleep on.\u201d Klepto says.\n\nYou assure the rest that you\u2019ll be fine and head back with them to the trailer and that\u2019s when you truly begin to appreciate Klepto\u2019s warnings. The floor of their trailer is filthier than Ranko\u2019s. A lot of food leavings, wrappers and some dirty clothing. You imagine that Fatty is probably the biggest contributor to the trash.\n\nOddly the smell isn\u2019t that bad, but you\u2019re not sure about sleeping on the floor anymore.\n\n\u201cUh, I see what you mean. I think you\u2019re right. If I slept on the floor, I\u2019d wake up stuck to it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI told you, so what did you want to do?\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cMy offer still stands Suzy and I swear I\u2019m not going to try anything. The alleviation of your worries is my foremost concern.\u201d Lifto remarks.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s sweet, but I\u2019m still sleeping here and not on the floor. I\u2019m taking one of those beds.\u201d\n\nAt this point the rest of the clowns are a little surprised by your demand.\n\n\u201cUh look Suzy, I know you\u2019re concerned about sleeping in your trailer tonight even if I think there isn\u2019t anything to worry about and I know we\u2019ve all gotten a little closer and we all like each other, but come on you don\u2019t seriously think one of us is going to give up our bed for a disgusting floor!\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to I\u2019m taking Shrimpy\u2019s bed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping on the floor either!\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, I\u2019ll share it with you.\u201d\n\u201cWAIT WHAT?!\u201d all of them say.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s like this. I\u2019m not going to take up that much room in your beds, which means Fatty and Lifto\u2019s beds are out since they themselves can barely fit in them. That leaves Klepto and Shrimpy. Personally I want as much room as I can get and with no offense to Shrimpy due to his size, he\u2019s got more room to spare.\u201d\n\nShrimpy smugly smiles at the others.\n\n\u201cMakes sense to me! Okay let\u2019s get to bed everyone!\u201d Shrimpy says excitedly.\n\u201cHey wait a minute! We didn\u2019t agree to this!\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cYeah, it seems like you were worried about me trying something yet you\u2019re going to sleep in Shrimpy\u2019s bed? You might be waking up sticky anyway with that little perv next to you.\u201d Lifto says.\n\u201cOh no I won\u2019t because Shrimpy is going to not only sleep with his back towards me, we\u2019re also going to sleep head to toe\u2026well toe to waist anyway. And if I so much feel any sort of unwanted grope, fondle or bad touch during the night there will be severe consequences to his man parts. I might be a little nervous about sleeping by myself tonight, but I\u2019m not nervous about punching a dwarf in the balls because he\u2019s perving on me. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cI get it.\u201d Shrimpy remarks, but he doesn\u2019t seem any less disappointed in this arrangement though.\n\u201cAnd if anyone doesn\u2019t like it, well my trailer is currently empty for anyone. Lots of room to get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d You add.\n\nNobody takes you up on your trailer offer or says anything else though you hear some grumbling from Fatty who says he just wants to get off his feet and sleep and on that note you all head for dreamland.\n\nYou get in Shrimpy\u2019s bed first and get into a comfortable position, and then Shrimpy does likewise at the opposite end of the bed.\n\nYou\u2019re semi-awake for a while wondering if Shrimpy is going to ignore your warning, but he\u2019s asleep pretty fast. Honestly its Fatty\u2019s snoring that\u2019s more bothersome. You guess the others are used to it.\n\nAs you start to get sleepy you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not only sharing a bed with a midget clown, but that you\u2019re going to leave everything behind tomorrow. The funny thing is you\u2019re getting a lot more comfortable with that idea now.

I mean REALLY like you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I got that impression a long time ago.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m trying to say it\u2019s not just physical.\u201d\n\u201cI find that a little harder to believe\u2026however I\u2019m not really going to fault you for it, but I\u2019m going to need a lot more proof that you want something deeper than just sex.\u201d\n\u201cWell what? Like a ring or something?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re exactly in a financial position for all that. Look, I like you too, but this probably isn\u2019t the best time to expect anything more from me than just friendship. I\u2019m still trying to get used to the fact of this being my new life now not to mention I\u2019m just getting over breaking up with what was my first and only boyfriend. So I might prefer my own company for a while. However that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t TRY to gain my affection. But only IF you REALLY want something meaningful with me. If not, then I\u2019d suggest that you not waste either of our time and you go find a less discerning mate. I don\u2019t need prince charming either, I just need someone I can count on and isn\u2019t going to be a complete jerk.

You knew it was going to be one of them eventually though. You can only imagine the others will be attempting to woo you as well just like in your routine with them. Funny how life starts to imitate art.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how sincere Klepto is even if he has been pleasant for the most part. (Can you really ever trust a guy with the name Klepto?)\n\nAttractiveness wise, Klepto probably is the best of the lot. Lifto would probably provide the best protection, but the guy is tough to look at even with clown make up on and as far as Fatty is concerned, the only thing that runs through your mind is potential sexual positions and only one of which doesn\u2019t result in you being crushed.\n\nPart of you wonders if you\u2019re bad for being shallow, but then you remember they\u2019re all attracted to you mostly due to your looks in the first place.\n\nThough for some reason you find Shrimpy\u2019s size adorable\u2026 in fact you might find some of the others dwarves that work here adorable as well if they weren\u2019t quite so vulgar with you. Maybe you\u2019ve got a hidden dwarf fetish you didn\u2019t know about before.\n\nOh well, you\u2019re not going to worry about any of this right now.\n\nAs you head back to your own trailer, you see most of the dwarves doing all the labor of packing down the carnival; others are helping, but most are just packing down their own respective stages and such.\n\n\u201cHey clown slut, if you\u2019re not actually going to be sleeping in your own trailer and just going to be playing cum dumpster to your painted freak friends, the least you can do is give it to one of us!\u201d a tattooed lady with big black Mohawk and several piercings in her face remarks catching you off guard.

I didn\u2019t do anything to her!\u201d\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t, you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but now I probably got a target on my back, one of many probably since Razor isn\u2019t the only one who hates me around here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve noticed. Just because I\u2019m half drunk most of the time doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not aware of what goes on around here. Listen some of the negative feelings that some have for you will die down in time. You seem to be getting along with your new clown co-workers very well though. You spent the night over in their trailer despite the fact you have your own.\u201d\n\u201cI only did that because I didn\u2019t feel safe sleeping alone last night. There was a really creepy big guy staring at me all day yesterday, I dunno maybe I was just being paranoid.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, did you wish to bunk with them or even someone else then? I mean I can make arrangements if you feel uncomfortable sleeping alone.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I appreciate the fact you gave me my own trailer. Besides, given all the new friends I\u2019m making, I\u2019d be safer sleeping alone and bunking with Klepto and the rest, well I get the impression that would cause other problems.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay then. Well, I\u2019ll let you get back to your trailer. We\u2019ll probably be ready to go just before nightfall so I\u2019m sure Lifto will be around then to hook this thing up to one of our trucks. So until then just enjoy the downtime.\u201d\n\u201cWait, aren\u2019t I supposed to be helping pack up the carnival?\u201d\n\u201cYou? Nah, the rest of the guys can handle it. Really I get the impression they wouldn\u2019t let you do much work anyway what with them all being enamored with you and all. And the dwarves got the overall pack up covered. Always have, it\u2019s what they do. Backbone of the carnival and all\u2026and all a bit of a waste of time given what\u2019s to come, but hey we do what we know.\u201d Roofie says and leaves.\n\nA little more cryptic future doom prediction by Roofie, you get the impression that\u2019s his general personality, but at least he\u2019s always pleasant with you.\n\nWith no more distractions you arrive at your trailer and that\u2019s when you begin to feel nervous again.\n\nFirst of all the door is slightly ajar. You also notice a couple things out of place from last time, not to mention it looks like someone spent some time in your bed and soiled it with their \u201cessence\u201d. Your cell phone that you left here is also gone, but given that its batteries were starting to die and you wouldn\u2019t have Bobby to pay for it much longer it isn\u2019t much of a loss. Someone was definitely here last night. You don\u2019t know if it was Ranko, that big creepy retard staring at you or someone else, but either way you dodged a bullet.\n\nYou half expect the person to jump out at you from some hidden spot, but that doesn\u2019t happen. Whoever was here, probably left before the morning, and probably when they realized you weren\u2019t coming here.\n\nYou re-check all the trailer\u2019s locations (even if it isn\u2019t the biggest place) and block the door with a chair before feeling safe enough to shower and get changed.\n\nAfterwards you go through the mundane process of actually cleaning up the trailer. You figure if you don\u2019t need to help pack up the carnival, you can at least spend your time clean up your living area. (First thing is throwing out the befouled bed sheet)\n\nBy the time you\u2019re finished it\u2019s the afternoon and you\u2019re tired again. You\u2019re still not used to being awake so early and you didn\u2019t get much sleep last night so you lie down in your now cleaner bed and shut your eyes for just a bit\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time passes while you\u2019re asleep again, but when you do wake up it\u2019s to a loud thumping at the door.\n\n\u201cOPEN UP BY ORDER OF THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD!\u201d\n\nNational Guard? What the hell is going on?\n\n\u201cHold on, hold on, I\u2019m getting up!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cOpen the door miss or we\u2019ll be forced to bash it open!\u201d a voice calls back.\n\nNot wishing to potentially get shot you comply and upon opening the door several national guardsmen stand outside.\n\n\u201cCome with us miss, we need you all together for your safety.\u201d A young soldier says guiding you out.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cJust to that big tent over there. Don\u2019t worry, this is all for your protection.\u201d\n\nSomehow you don\u2019t quite believe that, but when you scan your surroundings, you see that the carnival appears to be under control by the National Guard so there isn\u2019t much choice but to comply. You don\u2019t know why or how this came to be, but from some of the military radios you overhear it sounds like riots have broken out in your town. Is this some sort of martial law?\n\nWhen you arrive in the big tent, most of carnival is there. Most are sitting at tables and complaining about this fate. You see Roofie actively arguing with one of the higher ranking soldiers who looks utterly unmoved by what he has to say.\n\n\u201cGoddamnit, just because people are rioting in the town doesn\u2019t mean any bullshit is going on here! We\u2019re not even locals! We\u2019re just passing through and were about to leave!\u201d Roofie says.\n\u201cYeah I heard you the first time, but my orders are to secure this entire area and will be under watch until further notice. Now I suggest you get out of my face before I stomp a mud hole in your ass clown!\u201d the officer remarks and walks out of the tent.\n\nYou go over to Roofie.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cEnd times like I always knew would come Suzy. Just didn\u2019t figure I\u2019d have to spend my last days stuck under the gun by a bunch of fascists! These government dickheads think they can control what\u2019s coming soon, when they really can\u2019t control shit. These fools don\u2019t even know they\u2019re all really just puppets for that fucking Ground Zero corporation that\u2019s been shilling bomb shelters ads all over the damn place.\u201d\n\nThis is definitely a new side you\u2019ve seen of Roofie, he\u2019s really mad. He\u2019s also really drunk even if he\u2019s pretty coherent. You see Klepto and the rest waving you over.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go over there and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know what Suzy? There aren\u2019t even that many of these fuckers. It\u2019s a skeleton crew at best. I bet we can take them. I mean we certainly outnumber them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Are you nuts? They\u2019re armed with machine guns!\u201d you say.\n\u201cAnd? So a few of us die? We\u2019re ALL gonna be dead soon anyway, why wait? Better to die on your feet than live on your knees. Seriously, all we gotta do is get a couple of those guns away from them and it already evens up the playing field. Seriously you think they\u2019re probably going to let us live anyway? They\u2019re probably going to line us up like baby seals and blow our brains out by tomorrow. I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m getting our own troops in order to rebel tonight.\u201d\n\nRoofie seems pretty intent on going through with this plan, the only thing you can think of to do is either try to help or try to prevent the violence.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Roofie", "result": "\u201cOkay well maybe you\u2019ve got a point, but can you really stir this lot up to swarm attack people with machine guns?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOne way to find out!\u201d Roofie says and without another word he runs over to the nearest guard and smashes a bottle over his head. It might\u2019ve been more effective had the guardsman not had a helmet on.\n\nThe guardsman that was assaulted bashes Roofie to the ground and fires several shots into him. This causes shock from everyone and in your case you even freeze up for a moment. Nobody is bum rushing the guardsmen though.\n\nRoofie won\u2019t be getting up again, but at this point the guardsmen continue to panic and believe they\u2019re under a greater attack. (Despite that everyone is too scared to do so)\n\n\u201cSHIT! WE NEED BACK UP! WE\u2019RE UNDER ATTACK!\u201d the other guardsman exclaims and begins firing randomly at carnies, which includes you.\n\nUnfortunately, you were close enough that you fatally get hit by some of these bullets despite trying to get out of the way.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Prevent the violence", "result": "Roofie\u2019s plan isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything except get a bunch of people killed, and you could be one of them!

I\u2019m sure Klepto and the rest are going to want to hear this first.\u201d\n\u201cHrgh, okay. You don\u2019t need to guide me damn it, I\u2019m not that drunk!\u201d Roofie says and pulls his arm away from your hand.\n\nWhen you get to Klepto\u2019s table he and the rest know something is wrong when Roofie starts going on about \u201cbum rushing those government puppet bastards.\u201d Shrimpy and Fatty both attempt to calm him down, but he\u2019s not having any of it.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on Suzy? Roofie\u2019s talkin\u2019 crazier than usual.\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cHe wants to have the entire carnival attack the National Guard, do something before he causes too much of a scene.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDo something like what? You don\u2019t mean kill him do you?!\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cNo! But I dunno maybe knock him out to buy us time and he can sober up or something. Lifto, knock him out.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMe?! Why me?\u201d Lifto asks.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re the strongest of all of us and I\u2019m guessing you could do it in one hit. Just do it, before he gets all of us killed!\u201d\n\nLifto\u2019s a little reluctant and probably wouldn\u2019t do it normally, but it the situation does seem dire enough so while Roofie is continuing to rant at Shrimpy and Fatty he punches Roofie in the back of the head, knocking the older man completely out and falling into Fatty\u2019s arms.\n\nSome of the other carnies have witnessed this, but they don\u2019t seem to do anything about it. In fact it just goes to show how little most of them respect Roofie in the scheme of the things. Sort of a shame.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, did you have to punch him so hard? He\u2019s an old guy! You might\u2019ve put him in a coma!\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cI just did what Suzy told me!\u201d\n\u201cAlright look, I didn\u2019t want harm to come to Roofie either, but the guy needed to be silenced for at least a moment. I think the bigger problem we\u2019ve got is the other carnies. I get the sense that they think Roofie is no longer a factor in the leadership role, so expect a power play. We all need to stick together for protection.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the National Guard? I mean shouldn\u2019t we be worrying about them?\u201d Lifto asks.\n\u201cThe National Guard is what\u2019s keeping this carnival from exploding into an orgy of violence right now. Nobody\u2019s going to risk pissing them off by causing problems, well not now at least without Roofie\u2019s plan of stirring them all up.\u201d You reply.\n\n\u201cWell what the hell do we do now?\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I mean I\u2019m just thinking on my feet here! You all told me that we\u2019re the most hated group in the carnival, so we should make friends somehow? Shrimpy, do you have ANY pull with the dwarves?\u201d\n\u201cPull? I suppose I have enough for me, I mean even as a clown deep down I\u2019ll always be a dwarf. But as I\u2019ve mentioned before I can\u2019t promise anything for the rest of you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I dunno, do some diplomacy or something. As for the rest of us, we need to just stick to our table and look after Roofie, and make sure he\u2019s doing okay throughout the night. Maybe I\u2019ll try to charm one of the soldiers or something. The key thing to remember is we need to survive this together.\u201d\n\nYou never thought you\u2019d start sounding like your older brother Ben with the whole survivalist shtick, but if it helps thinking like a paranoid person then you aren\u2019t going to dismiss such thoughts.\n\nAs night starts to fall the mood in the large army \u201cquarantine\u201d tent grows more restless. Two guardsmen remain on duty at all times though they\u2019re not exactly happy about the situation either. You do manage to get friendly with one of them by the name of Roger and extract a bit more info.\n\nRoger tells you that you and the rest of your carny friends shouldn\u2019t worry too much since this is just a formality. He says that things are much worse in the town and expects his unit will be transferred to support his fellow guardsmen there in a day or two. At which point you\u2019ll all be free to go.\n\nHearing about the mass riots in town makes you wonder how things are going for your family. You\u2019re almost sort of worried about them, even Kelly, but there isn\u2019t much that can be done now. Hopefully they\u2019ve found some sort of safety.\n\n\u201cIs this going on everywhere?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know a lot of detail, I\u2019m just a grunt in the scheme of things, but things are getting pretty bad, I mean haven\u2019t you heard the news lately?\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cNot really, sort of disconnected from the rest of the world lately.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell world tensions have been really high, it\u2019s like every country is gearing up for world war three and domestically people have seemingly gone batshit insane with regards to the rules of common decency and morality. I guess a lot of people are just scared and I can\u2019t blame them on some level, but we still need law and order. Surely you can understand that right?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d You say in agreement since you\u2019d rather not make any potential enemies of the military even if it is just one grunt.\n\nIn any case Roger smiles when you agree, you get the impression he\u2019s just as concerned being out here. After a few more pleasantries, Roger says he really needs to get back to \u201cstanding guard\u201d and not talking to you as his superior is a real hard ass and he doesn\u2019t want to get into trouble or you for that matter. You thank him for the talk and head back to your colleagues.\n\nOf course some of the carnies seeing you get \u201ccozy\u201d with one of the guardsmen makes them even dislike you even more and you occasionally hear mutterings and name calling by others. Razor hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off of you the whole time you\u2019ve been here. She\u2019s obviously got her sights set on you, regardless of what goes down, she\u2019s just waiting for opportunity.\n\nOn the plus side when Shrimpy returns he says that while the dwarves are going to make their own play when the time is right, he\u2019s managed to convince them not to attack the clowns as long as you stay out of their way. (And apparently they\u2019re ONLY extending that courtesy because of Shrimpy\u2019s ties as well you being\u2026well you, though the female dwarves predictably don\u2019t like you too much)\n\nThe night goes on and while everyone is in a heightened state of readiness nobody can stay awake forever, so eventually people start falling asleep though its mostly in shifts for most groups and you are no exception.\n\nEventually though when it\u2019s your turn to sleep, you try to find some sort of comfort on one of the many sleeping mats provided. It\u2019s pretty much impossible, but exhaustion helps you along.\n\nEventually you drift off\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\nSeveral gunshots cause you to wake up.\n\n\u201cWhat the?!\u201d you say still staying on the floor.\n\u201cShhhh! Quiet!\u201d Klepto remarks and points over to the one in charge of the guardsmen. He and five others stand near the tent entrance with weapons out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit WHO started the fight or even why! You carny freaks can tear each other apart after we leave, but until then we\u2019re here to maintain order and by god that\u2019s what the fuck we\u2019re going to do! If I have to break up another fight for any reason, next time the shots aren\u2019t going in the air!\u201d the officer remarks and leaves. The other guardsmen continue to stand near the entrance watching everyone who eventually all sit back down.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cRazor and some of the others got into an argument with Phil and his friends.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Phil?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHe does that fire eating stuff. Anyway, they kicked his ass and just as things were going to get worse, the guardsmen came in and put a stop to it like you just saw. Looks like the battle for control over the carnival is already starting.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised we didn\u2019t get attacked then.\u201d\n\u201cWell like Shrimpy said yesterday, we\u2019ve got dwarf protection for now, but who knows how long that arrangement is going to last.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I slept through a fight, where\u2019s Roofie?\u201d\n\u201cOh him? He\u2019s still over there out of it, even the gunshots didn\u2019t wake him up.\u201d Klepto says pointing to Roofie, who then surprises everyone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite awake Klepto, I\u2019m just resting with my eyes closed No point in getting up at this point anyway. It\u2019s obvious this carnival has lost respect in me; I\u2019d blame you all for smashing me in the back of the head last night, but that was really just a catalyst. (Sigh) Doesn\u2019t matter, I predict that we\u2019ll all be dead in two days at best.\u201d Roofie says.\n\n\u201cRoofie, we really didn\u2019t want to do it, but you were talking crazy with your idea of attacking the military. Your plan would\u2019ve gotten everyone killed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd that may still happen if recent events are any indication. At least with my plan I would\u2019ve died with the carnival intact rather than seeing it splitting up before my eyes.\u201d\n\nNobody else really knows what to say at this point, so you all just get silent and continue to converse with each other.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the next move?\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cI dunno, escape I guess? Can we get to one of the vehicles quickly and drive off?\u201d you say.\n\u201cGood luck with that given all the guardsmen on high alert now.\u201d Fatty points out.\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting very far.\u201d Lifto adds.\n\nYou sit down and exhale wondering what to do next, but you can\u2019t really think right now. It would seem that due to your more proactive suggestions and Roofie\u2019s apathy you\u2019ve somehow become the \u201cleader\u201d of your little group now. You hadn\u2019t really planned on that.\n\n\u201cFor right now, we\u2019re just going to stay put, I\u2019ll try to think of something.\u201d You remark. The rest of your group lack any ideas of their own, so they comply with your plan (or lack there of).\n\nTime passes and you mostly do a lot of casual conversation and mental speculation of what might happen \u201cif you do X.\u201d You half expect someone else to try to escape, particularly when they say they need to use the bathroom, but given that they always return under the same guard they left with it would seem nobody has the guts to really try it, not even Razor.\n\nNobody else in your group comes up with any plans either, but you do notice Shrimpy occasionally heads over to the group of dwarves. He claims he\u2019s just securing the \u201calliance\u201d but you\u2019re more inclined to believe he\u2019s just trying to secure his own safety. So far though the dwarves are still supposed to be on your side.\n\nRoofie has continued to lie on the sleeping mat not saying anything to anyone. You still feel a little bad about betraying him especially given that he not only brought you into this carnival and liked you enough to give you a personal trailer, but also that he potentially saved you a lot of pain when Razor was going to kick your ass.\n\nYou go over to talk to him.\n\n\u201cHey Roofie.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHrm, hey Suzy.\u201d He grunts.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Well other than not having a drink all day, I\u2019m fine. Just been making peace with my life I suppose.\u201d Roofie says.\n\u201cRoofie, I\u2019m still very sorry about\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Having Lifto wack me over the head? I\u2019ve forgotten about that or rather I\u2019ve rethought my own stance on that. You probably were right, I mean sure I would\u2019ve rather died like that, but that was sort of selfish of me to want to use my last bit of dwindling influence to get everyone to follow me. Would\u2019ve especially been a shame if you\u2019d gotten killed in the crossfire. You\u2019re actually very talented.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d\n\u201cNo it\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t make my decision to hire you based on looks or on a whim. In the brief moment you\u2019ve performed as a clown you were good. I mean it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re even a leader with how you got the other clowns hanging on your decisions. (Sigh) If only you had come across this carnival sooner. Things might\u2019ve been much different.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not sure how much of a leader I am, because I can\u2019t think of what comes next.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll figure out something I\u2019m sure. One thing though and while I don\u2019t hold out much hope, if you can somehow keep this carnival together\u2026do it. I know the current situation isn\u2019t the best and I know you haven\u2019t exactly been welcomed by everyone, but I see something in you that would feel fulfilled if you could experience the carnival like it once was. Like a family.\u201d\n\u201cA family?\u201d you say with a smirk.\n\u201cHey like I said, you came in during the family fight. And that\u2019s what happens in families sometimes. Family fights are always the most vicious, but after it dies down, sometimes the family unit can be stronger than ever. And I think you could be happy if you can keep this family from tearing itself apart completely. But you\u2019ll have to be the one to do it. I don\u2019t have it in me anymore.\u201d\n\nAt this point Roofie touches your hand and you pat his before leaving him be again. You wonder if this is more of a last request by a \u201cdying\u201d man rather than looking out for your personal fulfillment. Still, you think he\u2019s genuine and sure it would be nice if the entire carnival became the happy family you never had, but you just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be possible.\n\nYou look around and see nothing much has changed except a changing of the guards. One of them happens to be Roger, which makes you think of a possible way you could escape. The only problem is it\u2019s going to rely on being more \u201ccharming\u201d than you already have been with Roger and that could potentially get you into a situation you don\u2019t want to be in.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to Roger", "result": "While you hope you don\u2019t have to go too far, if it means getting the hell out of this place, then maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have to do because whether the National Guard leaves or stays the fact remains, you\u2019re not the one to lead this carnival like Roofie thinks you are and you feel your life is in danger.\n\nYou start to walk over to Roger.\n\n\u201cHey where are you going?\u201d Klepto asks.\n\u201cNot sure yet, but don\u2019t wait up.\u201d You reply and continue walking to Roger.\n\nWhen you get to Roger you\u2019re all smiles, poses and charm.\n\n\u201cHello Roger are you doing well today?\u201d You say in a friendly tone.\n\u201cHey, Suzy. I\u2019m okay I guess, but I really wish your friends wouldn\u2019t cause so much trouble. Somebody is libel to get hurt. My commanding officer isn\u2019t exactly the tolerant type and I think you saw that earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did. I was so scared. In fact I\u2019m scared of the whole aura this place is giving now. It\u2019s becoming very violent, but I feel so much safer being near you.\u201d You say and start to touch Roger.\n\nAt this point Roger is smiling back at you, but his buddy nearby is a little less approving, though you imagine its jealousy more than anything else.\n\n\u201cRoger, we\u2019re supposed to be keeping an eye on these carnie freaks, not fraternizing with them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm Ernie? I mean she says she\u2019s scared. What, you think she\u2019s going to clobber me in the head and take my weapon? Come on, stop being so paranoid. We shouldn\u2019t even be here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOrders are orders\u2026ugh. Whatever, I\u2019m not going to watch you make goo goo eyes at some carnie whore. I\u2019ll be outside this tent, try to keep your eyes on the detainees and not on her ass the whole time.\u201d Ernie says and steps outside the tent.\n\n\u201cWhat a rude person. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not like that.\u201d You say now with your arms wrapped around Roger.\n\u201cWell you know, I treat people the way they want to be treated.\u201d Roger replies.\n\nAs distracted as Roger is, he\u2019s actually keeping it together better than one would think. He keeps a tight grip on his rifle and an eye on if you\u2019re going to attempt to grab his pistol. He also periodically looks away from you to make sure nobody is taking advantage of this situation. (Which Klepto and the rest look like they were going to do, but realize they\u2019re still too far away to rush at Roger before he could shove you aside and open fire)\n\nThough your plan wasn\u2019t necessarily to save everyone, but rather yourself.\n\n\u201cSo Roger, what\u2019s a girl gotta do to get out of here?\u201d you say seductively.\n\u201cWell, like I said we should be gone later today or tomorrow at the latest.\u201d\n\u201cToo long and anything could happen within that time! Can\u2019t you do something? I mean I could make it worth your while.\u201d You say and run your finger across Roger\u2019s chest.\n\u201cSuzy, look, I\u2019d really like to help, but\u2026hey!\u201d Roger is interrupted when you grab his hand.\n\nYou bring his hand to your face and closing your eyes, you insert his index finger in your mouth and slowly suck on it making \u201cmmmmm\u201d sounds.\n\nThis scene hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by more than a few carnies watching you. In fact the predictable calls of \u201cwhore\u201d, \u201cslut\u201d and worse are uttered your way.\n\nRoger on the other hand is practically speechless.\n\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026shit\u2026\u201d he says and then pulls his hand away staring at his finger for a moment.\n\u201cAwww\u2026.but I wasn\u2019t done sucking on you\u2026\u201d you say and flutter your eyes a bit, trying to look as cute as possible then you whisper in his ear:\n\n\u201cTake me back to my trailer and I\u2019ll show you the REAL greatest show on earth.\u201d then you lick his ear.\n\nRoger immediately calls in Ernie loudly. Ernie rushes in with his weapon ready to kill something.\n\n\u201cWhat?! What?! Are they rioting again?!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cNo. But I REALLY need a favor! You need to watch these people and if the commander checks in on us, tell him I had a to take a shit really bad.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026wait\u2026 Oh fuck no! You\u2019re gonna go fuck this little carnie whore aren\u2019t you? Goddamnit Roger!\u201d\n\u201cCome on Ernie, you can\u2019t help me out?\u201d\n\u201cMotherfucker, I\u2019m always helping you out! I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just fuck the bitch right here. Not like these people are shy and from the looks of her, she looks like it wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019s gotten fucked in front of a live audience.\u201d Ernie remarks.\n\nYou know, while you\u2019ve gotten used to the baseless comments about you being a woman of loose morals, it still hurts sometimes.\n\nIn any case, Roger is not a man to be deterred from his lust for you right now.\n\n\u201cAlright, fine. I didn\u2019t want to hold this over your head, but you leave me no choice\u2026\u201d Roger starts to say, but whatever the threat is, Ernie doesn\u2019t even let him finish it.\n\u201cOh fuck. (Sigh) Don\u2019t even say it. Fine. Go. Go. Go! And don\u2019t take too long, though I imagine in your case that won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Ernie says defeated.\n\u201cThanks man! Seriously I really will remember this favor!\u201d\n\u201cHrm. That you only got through blackmail.\u201d\n\nAs you and Roger leave, Ernie says one more thing.\n\n\u201cHope you\u2019ve got condoms, because lord knows what diseases she\u2019s got being a carnie. Her kootch might turn your dick into a fucking Siamese Twin or some shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the hell does that even make sense? Fucking asshole\u2026\u201d you say and start to get angry at Ernie\u2019s comments, but Roger just take you by the hand to go back to your trailer.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind him. Let\u2019 hurry though, because we don\u2019t want to bump into anyone else. It isn\u2019t like I got leverage over everyone like I do with Ernie. So where is your trailer?\u201d\n\nYou tell him the location and the pair of you are heading over in that direction fluctuating between being \u201cstealthy\u201d and running.\n\nWhile you\u2019re doing this, it occurs to you that you have to think up your next move. Are you really going to let him fuck you? Roger is distracted enough that you probably could grab his side arm to give you enough time to make a run for it, but while Roger might not shoot you immediately (And that\u2019s rolling dice there) there\u2019s nothing to say the other nearby Guardsmen won\u2019t and you know they\u2019ll be alerted as soon as you try to run away from Roger.\n\nOf course if you really are willing to make that ultimate \u201csacrifice\u201d for freedom, Roger might even help you out a lot more in your escape attempt. Of course he could turn out to be a complete asshole and march you back to the tent after he\u2019s had his way with you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make a break for it", "result": "Roger is so busy keeping a look out for running into his buddies and getting to your trailer he\u2019s now suitably distracted and while you\u2019re so close to him, you easily grab his pistol.\n\n\u201cHEY WHAT\u2026\u201d he exclaims as you back away quickly and hold the gun on him.\n\u201cDrop the rifle!\u201d you shout. He doesn\u2019t though.\n\n\u201cShit. I should\u2019ve known better. Ernie\u2019s going to have a field day.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cSorry Roger, but I really need you to drop that rifle!\u201d you say.\n\u201c\u2026nah\u2026if you had it in you to shoot me, you would\u2019ve by now. You\u2019ve never shot a person and this whole situation is scary to you. You\u2019re hoping your sex appeal will be enough to carry you through this and that I\u2019ll be weak willed enough that I won\u2019t call your bluff and just shoot you dead right now.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an incredible amount insight for someone you thought was nothing more than just a horny grunt. Unfortunately he\u2019s pretty much on target.\n\nFor a moment there is a pause and you look at him hopefully, you even manage to start tearing up a bit.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Look, I told you we were going to leave soon, I dunno why you feel the need to go through this elaborate escape plan when it really isn\u2019t necessary. Just hand the pistol over and we\u2019ll head back to the tent.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re too scared of what might happen if you just surrender, so all you can do is continue to aim it at Roger.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I\u2019m not fucking around now give me the\u2026\u201d Roger begins to say and moves towards you. With his rifle slightly lowered and his hand outstretched, you nervously fire two shots at him. At this range you don\u2019t miss even though you\u2019re in a heightened state of anxiety.\n\nRoger falls to the ground with two in his chest and doesn\u2019t move, you\u2019ve killed him.\n\n\u201cOh my\u2026oh god I\u2019m sorry\u2026(Sniff)\u201d you say.\n\nThe shots of course have drawn the attention of the other guardsmen. You hear shouting which is getting closer to your location, so you run.\n\nYou hear more shouting followed by gunfire. At first you think they\u2019ve seen you and are shooting at you, but that isn\u2019t the case when you start to hear a few screams.\n\nNow you\u2019re even more scared as you have no idea what\u2019s going on. Did the carnies take advantage of this situation and start to fight back? You have no idea, but you don\u2019t intend on sticking around.\n\nYou duck and hide the best you can through the small maze of trailers and vehicles. The screams, shouting and gunfire are now accompanied by unnatural growing. Like animals of some sort.\n\nUnfortunately as you reach the far end of the carnival limits you are ambushed by something skulking behind the corner of the last trailer you were passing and the pistol goes sprawling out of your hand.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know what it is, except that you\u2019re on the ground and it\u2019s on your back breathing heavily and making that growling sound you heard. You then feel teeth sink deep into your shoulder.\n\nPain and fear both rise up in you for a moment as you struggle to get free, but this thing what ever it is has a strong grip and with one of its hands it smashes your face repeatedly into the ground into your struggling becomes less, then it breaks your neck before feasting on the rest of your dead body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go through with it", "result": "You aren\u2019t confident that you\u2019d make it with trying to ambush Roger. While it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll get some sort of better opportunity while in the trailer, at this point you\u2019re going to hope that Roger isn\u2019t an asshole and this will actually get him to help you escape.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to place on hope, but it\u2019s going to have to do.\n\nSoon you get to your trailer and you enter it with Roger still looking around before going in himself.\n\nYou stand by your bed and look at it and then look at Roger.\n\n\u201cSo here we are.\u201d He says.\n\u201cYeah\u2026so here we are\u2026\u201d you reply.\n\u201cWell? Come on, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d Roger says and puts his weapons down though of course he puts them out your reach and starts guiding you to lay down on the bed.\n\nThis is going to happen. It isn\u2019t that Roger isn\u2019t unattractive to you and this isn\u2019t exactly like he\u2019s coercing you to do anything (though you\u2019re afraid he might if you resist at this point) its just\u2026well directly using your pussy to get yourself out of a jam isn\u2019t exactly how you do things. Indirectly by teasing and flirting? Sure you\u2019ve gotten used to doing that, but this is a step you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to take and it\u2019s too late at this point.\n\nRoger is already stripping his clothes off and you\u2019re slowly doing likewise. Soon the pair of you are naked and his dick\u2019s coming at you like a monster. As he moves in to kiss and embrace you, you stop him.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026could we not look at each other while we do this?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he asks, almost looking a bit wounded by that comment.\n\u201cUh, I just mean can we do it doggy style? I just prefer it that way.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cOh. Well yeah! Sure, however you want it. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d Roger says and you get into position.\n\nWell at least now you can close your eyes and pretend its Bobby. Hopefully Roger isn\u2019t much of a talker and just gets on with it.\n\nWhile you prepare yourself for this \u201cexperience\u201d, gunshots are suddenly heard outside. Several of them in fact. This is followed by a lot of shouting.\n\n\u201cOh fuck! What the hell?!\u201d Roger exclaims and no longer do you feel his hands at your haunches, he\u2019s gotten off the bed.\n\nYou turn over and see him starting to get dressed, periodically looking out the narrow windows.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI have no idea, but whatever it is, YOU stay inside and keep down. I don\u2019t want you getting hurt.\u201d\n\nYou start to get dressed as well, wondering what calamity has happened now. Did the carnies finally decide to rush the guardsmen?\n\nRoger, with his clothes back on, grabs his rifle and pistol and prepares to head out.\n\n\u201cSuzy, remember what I said, stay inside\u2026OH SHIT!\u201d Roger shouts as he opens the door.\n\nSomething humanoid runs into Roger who drops his rifle and is pinned against the wall. It\u2019s growling and snarling and Roger is holding its neck in an attempt to not let it bite him.\n\nFear grips you, but not so much that you can\u2019t grab a nearby knife from the kitchen area in an effort to stab it.\n\n\u201cSuzy stay back! I got it!\u201d Roger shouts and manages to shove the thing off of him and out the door. He then pulls out his pistol and presumably fires at the thing several times. He then slams the door shut and attempts to lock and barricade it.\n\n\u201cDid you kill it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. I think I did.\u201d Roger answers.\n\u201cYou think? Don\u2019t you think you better know?!\u201d\n\u201cYes! Yes! I killed it! I mean I put two it\u2019s head and three in its chest. Jesus Christ, gimme a moment here! One moment I was nearly in paradise and the next I\u2019m fending off a fucking\u2026zombie\u2026or something\u2026shit I dunno what the hell\u2026\u201d Roger says trying to wrap his head around this unexpected turn of events.\n\nZombie. Did he just say that thing was a zombie? It was humanoid and trying to bite him, while making snarling and growling sounds. Then again it didn\u2019t look exactly rotten, could\u2019ve been new dead though. Maybe just a rabid human?\n\nSeems silly that you\u2019re actually considering that you\u2019re getting attacked by zombies. Never the less, the gunfire and chaos you\u2019re hearing outside seems to suggest you\u2019re being attacked by SOMETHING.\n\nMeanwhile Roger is sitting and mumbling to himself. Suddenly he stands up.\n\n\u201cFuck it. Suzy, you still wanna get out of here right?\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cWell of course.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019re taking one of those trucks. I got the keys.\u201d\n\u201cOkay? But what about your friends?\u201d\n\u201cHah, most of those guys I serve with are assholes. I mean you saw my commanding officer and Ernie. Can\u2019t say any of them are my friends. What about you and your carnie family?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 the clowns were cool with me and the owner\u2026but well it\u2019s complicated and let\u2019s just say I wasn\u2019t fitting in there, so while I do feel slightly guilty just abandoning the ones that I was getting along with, I can\u2019t stay someplace where I don\u2019t feel entirely welcome or safe.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then its settled, we\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about those things out there?\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019re going to have to grab the truck now because either one or two things is going to happen. One, the rest of my squad is going to put these things down and both of us are going to be up shit\u2019s creek or those things are going to kill everyone and we\u2019ll have to brave through them while they\u2019re not distracted by others.\u201d\n\nRoger unblocks the door and kicks it open, ready to shoot anything that might be lurking outside, fortunately that isn\u2019t the case right now.\n\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s do this and stick close to me.\u201d he says and the pair of you run out the trailer.\n\nThe sounds of creatures and gunfire are all around you and you haven\u2019t stepped out of the trailer a few seconds when Roger has to shoot two more of the things. He doesn\u2019t hit them in the head and they still stay down, so you\u2019re guessing maybe the zombie thing isn\u2019t the case. Still don\u2019t want to get bit though, who knows if this is contagious?\n\nYou see a few dead bodies of guardsmen on the ground and in one case one of those cannibals eating it and not paying any attention to anything else. The fact that the sounds of gunfire dying down and an increase in the screaming and yelling signals to you that things are getting grim. You wonder if they\u2019ve gotten to the carnies yet.\n\nIs this going on everywhere? Is this local? You\u2019ll have to figure that out later. Right now you\u2019re just happy to get inside a heavy-duty military truck.\n\nRoger gets in the driver\u2019s seat and with more snarling creatures banging on the doors and trying to get in, Roger starts up the truck and promptly runs over three of them on your way out this place.\n\nSoon you\u2019re on the road, but what next?\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. If this is some sort of plague or invasion or something I\u2019m wondering if we shouldn\u2019t head to Fort Timons, it\u2019s the closest military facility around here and where I was stationed before I got sent here. Still quite a drive though.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cWhat? Are you nuts? Didn\u2019t you just go AWOL and now you\u2019re thinking about going to an military base?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 I mean yeah technically I just deserted my post\u2026but considering it didn\u2019t seem like anyone else is going to live through that attack I doubt if anyone is going to call me out on it. We could just tell them we were the only survivors.\u201d\n\u201cBut if this is some sort of disease will a military base even be safe? I mean don\u2019t these sorts of thing originate from them what with all the secret experiments and bioweapons?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You watch too many horror movies or science fiction! Unless its some secret base with top level government security, the average ordinary military base isn\u2019t going to have a lab where they\u2019re making bioweapons! In any case I know that stuff isn\u2019t at Fort Timons.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026just doesn\u2019t seem the safest place.\u201d\n\u201cWell where do you propose then?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have an answer.\n\n\u201cSee? Look, it\u2019s still a long drive there, maybe I can get something on the radio and we can find out more. Too bad this one doesn\u2019t have a two-way radio, we\u2019d actually be able to communicate with someone and I lost my fucking cell phone. In fact I probably left it in your trailer.\u201d\n\nAs Roger attempts to get a signal on the radio, you think about how you\u2019ve now run away from two \u201cfamilies\u201d and who knows what\u2019s become of both of them. Are they dead? Are they alive? Has you hometown been overrun by those things? Is it under marshal law?\n\nYou feel a little sad about it all, but what can you really do?\n\nAs the day eventually turns into night, Roger continues to try to get something on the radio, but its just static on the military channel he\u2019s using. He doesn\u2019t understand it. Switching over to the normal radio just gets music, which is broken up by the periodic Ground Zero advert. Absolutely nothing about the creatures though, not even regular news. It\u2019s very frustrating.\n\nYour aren\u2019t encountering too much traffic on the road either, granted this isn\u2019t the busiest of roads, but it feels fairly isolated. Still, at least you\u2019re not seeing a horde of those things roaming about.\n\nRoger talks a little about his past to break up the long periods of silence, most of it fairly mundane. You just mainly listen although you\u2019re only really half listening and re-direct questions about yourself to something superficial. You\u2019re not in the mood to talk about yourself.\n\nEventually you start to get sleepy and Roger does as well. He pulls over and the both of you go to sleep and thankfully he never once suggests picking up where you left off in your trailer.\n\nNothing like a bunch of cannibal creatures to break up the mood.\n\nYou drift off to sleep\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026this was a paid announcement by the Ground Zero Corporation\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAgh! Shut the fuck up already. What the hell did GZ buy up all the goddamn stations?!\u201d you hear Roger shout as he angrily turns the radio off, waking you up.\n\nIt would seem you\u2019re in motion again and you slept through it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? Oh you\u2019re up. Nothing\u2019s going on, just dumb ass Ground Zero commercials warning about an impending nuclear holocaust as usual. Never mind the fact we got a very real threat that I can\u2019t seem to get any information on. Anyway I didn\u2019t sleep that much so I just started driving again. Figured you could still sleep though so I didn\u2019t bother waking you\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cSo how long have we been on the road?\u201d\n\u201cMore than a few hours definitely. Starting to by pass all this farmland area now, we\u2019ll probably be hitting a more populated area soon. I also started to see a few more moving vehicles, though I\u2019ve also been seeing a lot of abandoned vehicles as well. Oddly no military. Saw a few people even trying to hitch a ride, but I\u2019m not playing good Samaritan right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou see any of those things?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHrm, I thought I might\u2019ve seen a few while I was driving, but from the distance I could quite tell. Wasn\u2019t like I was going to check.\u201d\n\nSo far it looks like the plan is still going to Fort Timons, but if you didn\u2019t think that was a dubious idea before, you\u2019re really uncertain now. He can\u2019t get any signal from the radio, for all you know the base might be overrun by those things. Which is exactly what you bring up to Roger, but he seems confident that wouldn\u2019t be the case and he\u2019s determined to head to Fort Timons. Funny thing considering he abandoned all his comrades at the carnival and said they were all assholes. Guess he\u2019s still military at heart.\n\nHe senses that you still aren\u2019t comfortable with his plan though.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you don\u2019t need to come with me you know. I mean I can drop you off at the next town we go through.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cAnd what exactly am I going to do there? I don\u2019t have anything except the clothes on my back and with the way things are going, I can imagine I\u2019d be resorting to taking those off a lot just to survive.\u201d You say.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence before Roger replies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what you were doing with me back at the carnival. It\u2019s fine, I sort of knew that\u2019s what was going on. I knew you didn\u2019t actually like me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you knew all that, why did you risk your career and possibly your life?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right? I mean I know I\u2019m not hideous, but you\u2019re a little out of my league. When the hell am I going to get a chance to be with someone that looks like you? I mean sure I knew it was all an act, but in MY mind I could pretend you were being genuine. Though I admit when you stopped me from kissing you and didn\u2019t want to look at my face, that sort of hurt.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal. I just don\u2019t know you that well and I wasn\u2019t ready for that level of intimacy. I was going to pretend you were my ex-boyfriend. (Sigh) I can\u2019t believe I even went that far and was going to go through with it. I mean contrary to whatever you may have heard shouted at me, I don\u2019t do stuff like that like\u2026ever.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Because you\u2019re pretty good at the whole seduction thing, even if you are a bit obvious with it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m obvious with it because it\u2019s only just a new skill I developed within the last few days I joined a goddamn carnival just to get out of my goddamn shitty life at home\u2026What the hell was I even thinking?! I\u2019m not cut out to take care of myself! I should\u2019ve just stayed home and let cannibals eat me in the comfort of my basement!\u201d you say, tearing up a bit. The stress of the week is starting to get to you.\n\n\u201cWhoa! You don\u2019t mean that. Things aren\u2019t totally horrible. Hey if it make you feel any better, I felt a little bad knowing that I was going to take advantage of what was obviously the act of a desperate woman.\u201d Roger says.\n\nNow you stop sniffling and start to chuckle at the absurdity of that statement.\n\n\u201cBut of course that wasn\u2019t going to stop you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell no of course not, but I assure you I would\u2019ve felt guilty about it.\u201d\n\u201cNo you wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\u201cOkay you\u2019re right, I wouldn\u2019t have, but I would have still gotten you out of that carnival if you had asked afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cWell at least it wouldn\u2019t have been for nothing. (Sigh) Guess it all worked out anyway. I mean we\u2019re both still alive due to our choices and I am thankful I\u2019m not dead and that you probably saved my life back there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful I at least got to see you naked.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always have the trailer I suppose.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t exactly feel good about your situation, but Roger\u2019s attempt to lighten up the mood at least has you feeling slightly better.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026why don\u2019t you tell me about this ex-boyfriend of yours? I\u2019m guessing he must\u2019ve been some sort of handsome stud if you\u2019re still thinking about him.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cHeh. Not especially. He was a normal looking guy. Not too much different from you in that department. He\u2019s just the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, so, it was more comfortable to think about him instead. Anyway it was sort of complicated with him. Long story that I don\u2019t want to get into right now.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. Well I\u2019ll just say this, he was lucky to have you as a girlfriend and was a damn fool to let you get away.\u201d\n\u201cHrm\u2026actually you know what? You\u2019re exactly right. He WAS lucky to have me and a damn fool to let me get away!\u201d you say with a bit of pride.\n\nYou know Roger is half saying this just in the hopes to get you into a compromising position again, but what the hell, it\u2019s an ego booster and it keeps you in a positive mindset at least.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d Roger suddenly says.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI just looked at the gas gauge, we\u2019re practically out. Goddamn it I thought Ernie gassed this thing up recently.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make it to Timons?\u201d\n\u201cWell we could risk it on fumes to Fort Timons, but I\u2019d rather not chance that during these circumstances. I don\u2019t even have a rubber hose that we could use to suck out the gas from one these abandoned vehicles we\u2019ve been passing.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re stopping at the next gas station then.\u201d\n\u201cAssuming they got any. I get the impression just popping into the next gas station isn\u2019t going to be that simple.\u201d\n\nYou and Roger continue to drive for about a half hour before you see something of interest in the distance. Namely a truck stop, which apparently has been converted into a minor fortress.\n\n\u201cHey look at that!\u201d you point out.\n\u201cI see it. It\u2019s a truck stop and it looks like whoever is there is trying to block the place off by putting trucks around it. They even got people standing on top of the trucks with rifles as look outs. They probably got gas.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cI dunno. Whoever is there probably isn\u2019t going to be too trustful of anyone, especially someone from the military. They might just try to rob us.\u201d\n\u201cWe gotta try. I mean we need gas, and given how well this place is defended, we at least know they probably got some. Who knows if we\u2019ll get lucky some place else.\u201d\n\nYou and Roger drive to the truck stop, which immediately causes the lookouts to point and raise their rifles in your direction. When you stop in front of it there are a lot of shouts for you to stay in the truck.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any government assistance here, we\u2019re doing just fine as you can see. I highly suggest that y\u2019all just continue on your way.\u201d One of them shouts.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here for trouble. I just need some gas. We get that and we\u2019ll be on our way to Fort Timons.\u201d Roger shouts back.\n\u201cGas? Don\u2019t fucking think so soldier boy. With the way society is collapsing that shit\u2019s gonna be valuable and money is gonna be worthless.\u201d\n\u201cWell, would you accept a trade of supplies for gas?\u201d\n\u201cHrmmm, well whatta you got?\u201d\n\u201cGot some military rations in the back of this thing. Those things last for years you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe got tons of food, what else? Any weapons?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026there might be a couple\u2026oh we got some medical supplies in here!\u201d\n\nThere is a long pause and he tells you to wait before climbing down the truck and disappearing from sight. Eventually you hear his voice again which is now coming from behind the truck barricade.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna move this truck, but one funny thing happens and you\u2019re the first one getting a bullet to the head. Alright, we\u2019re letting this one in, everyone keep extra look out for those rabid bastards!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still think this is a good idea?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s like I said, our options for gas are limited.\u201d Roger answers.\n\nAs soon as the truck is moved out your way, the man who was barking orders at you waves you in and motions you over to the gas pumps. As soon as you drive in they put the truck back. Either they\u2019re really safety conscience or they don\u2019t want to risk having you get away.\n\nFrom this distance you see several more people in the building part of the truck stop. Looks like it\u2019s a general store/diner combo. Most of them are watching you from the windows, though a few of them come out, one of them is an older man with a cane who walks directly to the pumps.\n\n\u201cOkay, I want the two you in that truck to exit it slowly. I don\u2019t care if you got weapons, but don\u2019t point them at me or anyone else in a threatening manner.\u201d The old man shouts.\n\nRoger takes his rifle over his shoulder and exits the truck. You do like wise, though being unarmed you exit from Roger\u2019s side just so you don\u2019t feel quite as vulnerable. Naturally rifles are pointed at the pair of you, but the old man with the cane shouts telling them to calm down.\n\n\u201cYou lot, stop pointing your guns and start unloading this truck. Sorry about that, everyone\u2019s a little on edge. Name\u2019s Henry. I own this place.\u201d He says.\n\u201cRoger and it\u2019s understandable.\u201d\n\u201cWell, a military man eh? Thought all the National Guard were off fighting those rabid things in the city. From what I\u2019ve heard the place is completely overrun now.\u201d\n\u201cThe city? You mean Security is overrun?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYep. Heard it on the radio. Not the regular one of course. Those GZ bastards seem to be clogging those up, but on my Ham Radio. Been trying to communicate with Fort Timons, but my radio isn\u2019t exactly in the best condition\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHold on! You\u2019ve been in communication with Fort Timons?!\u201d Roger exclaims.\n\u201cWell, somewhat. More like my old buddy I served with back in the day who still works there as an inventory clerk. Haven\u2019t heard anything from him since yesterday. All I know is the last thing he told me was the fort was on high alert and further communication was going to be limited to a need to know basis and only to those with the proper clearance. Typical military bullshit I suppose, well I don\u2019t need to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cUh, we were on our way to Fort Timons. Do you think it\u2019s safe?\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, well I couldn\u2019t tell you if the fort is safe, but I can tell you that those rabid fuckers have been making their way out of the city en mass and given how far the city is, they apparently don\u2019t get tired and can cover a lot of ground. We just repelled a bunch of them yesterday. Hence the make shift fortress here. Fort Timons is even closer to the city, so at best I\u2019d wager that you\u2019re going to have to wade through a bunch of those things before getting there. Not something I\u2019d want to do to be sure.\u201d Henry remarks.\n\u201cShit, those things are in the city and they were in my town! This means this can\u2019t just be a local thing! It\u2019s probably a nationwide epidemic! We can\u2019t go to Fort Timons now!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the place has fallen to those things.\u201d Roger replies.\n\u201cExactly! We don\u2019t know!\u201d you say.\n\nAt this point Henry interjects.\n\n\u201cIf I may, the both of you can stay here. We\u2019ve got the room and your truck full of supplies as far as I\u2019m concerned buys your way in. And I\u2019m sure as a military man, you\u2019d pull your weight here to defend this place if need be. So you and your girlfriend can stay here if you wish.\u201d Henry says and then walks over to oversee his people unloading the truck.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly tempting offer and one you\u2019d jump at the chance for, but Roger still seems sure that Fort Timons will better in the long run. You wonder if he feels a little obligated to go back to Fort Timons because deep down he feels like he abandoned his post even if hasn\u2019t admitted it.\n\nThe only downside is if Roger doesn\u2019t stick around and you do, you\u2019ll be left in the company of a bunch of strangers again and that didn\u2019t go so well last time. You can only imagine all the leers, grope attempts and possibly worse from a bunch of horny trucker types.", "action_results": [{"action": "Insist on staying here", "result": "Something in your heart is telling you that going to Fort Timons would be a huge mistake. The length of the trip and the possibility that it\u2019s going to be swarming with those things just doesn\u2019t seem safe. This place might not be safe either, but at least it\u2019s a secure place that you don\u2019t need to travel any further to.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I still think going to Timons is a better idea than staying here. I\u2019m going, so if you want to stay\u2026\u201d Roger says before you interrupt him.\n\nYou grip Roger by the head with both hands and move it downwards so you can kiss him on the lips. The kiss is then followed your arms moving downward in a tighter hugging motion. He returns in kind as the pair of you continue to embrace.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go. Please don\u2019t go to Fort Timons. It won\u2019t be safe and I need you here with me.\u201d You say stopping your kiss to speak.\n\u201cSuzy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Stay with me.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Suzy\u2026 do you really mean this? I mean I really need to know where we stand\u2026because\u2026you can\u2019t just flutter your eyes and kiss me without meaning it now. I\u2019m really starting to have feelings for you, but if you\u2019re just doing this out of survival again\u2026\u201d\n\nYou stare him directly in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes, Roger. I mean it. Not just for me, but for you. I don\u2019t want you to put yourself in any danger anymore than I want myself to be in danger. And Fort Timons is just going to be unnecessary danger. I know we haven\u2019t known each other long, but we have been through a lot together and if this is the way this shitty world is going to be, then I want to at least spend the rest of that time with you.\u201d\n\nWell if you didn\u2019t mean any of that, it sure was enough to convince Roger because he resumes kissing and hugging you immediately. Of course you did mean it since you have grown attached to him. Just a sucker for men who save your life you guess.\n\nYou both don\u2019t even notice Henry walking up to you.\n\n\u201cHrm, looks like I interrupted something. So did you two decide on what you\u2019re going to do\u2026besides suck on each others faces?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Roger says and then smiles at you before turning his attention to Henry. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be staying.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Glad to hear it. Need more people to help defend this place. Think you could help with look out for awhile with that rifle of yours?\u201d Henry says.\n\u201cSure. For how long?\u201d Roger asks.\n\u201cHmm, probably until midnight. Earl needs to get some sleep, that\u2019s why he\u2019s so irritable right now. As for you little lady, why don\u2019t you head on inside and get acquainted with everyone. You and your boyfriend can pick up where you left off later.\u201d\n\nHenry goes to wander over to Earl to give him the news that he\u2019ll be relieved soon and you and Roger are left alone again.\n\n\u201cOkay, well I guess I\u2019ll see you later tonight then.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cYes, though I wonder where we\u2019re supposed to sleep.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell presumably together now.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, of course but that wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d\n\u201cHrm, I\u2019m sure someone will tell you inside what the sleeping arrangements are, well anyway I probably should get over to my new job. See you later.\u201d Roger says.\n\nAs he leaves, you shout to him to be careful which he just smiles and waves as a reassurance that you don\u2019t need to worry about him.\n\nAnd now you turn towards the truck stop building which no longer has the small crowd outside it anymore and people have gone back inside. People which you now have to be social with\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, Suzy. You can do this. It won\u2019t be like the carnival.\u201d You mumble to yourself as you walk to the building.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you see a mixture of people. Mostly older men, but women as well and even a couple children. Most of them look up when you enter.\n\n\u201cHi everyone. I\u2019m Suzy and my boyfriend Roger are going to be staying here, but we brought in a whole bunch of medical supplies and food with us to help pull our weight around here.\u201d\n\nYour introduction is met with apathy. Half of them grunt in acknowledgement and the other half just go back to doing whatever it is they were doing.\n\nWell it\u2019s better than most of what you got at the carnival.\n\nSeeing that nobody is speaking to you, you decide to sit quietly by yourself in a booth far away from everyone else. You mainly spend your time in introspection and listening to the random conversations. Most of them naturally are talking about the situation at hand, but it\u2019s broken up by periods of \u201cnormalcy\u201d of just joking around.\n\nNobody here seems to be overly worried about rabid people running around and the breaking down of society, then again most of the people here are truckers so they\u2019re probably used to roaming about and the employees of the place seem like they spend so much time here it\u2019s a second home.\n\nEventually enough time passes and you get tired of being a wall flower, or more specifically you\u2019re tired of wearing the same clothes for the past few days along with no shower. You walk up to the group of waitresses in the hopes to ask them that perhaps there is some sort of wash up facility here.\n\nThe oldest waitress, a red head with hard features and a name tag that says Anne looks you up and down as you approach and her friends do likewise.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, but is there a wash room or shower or something I could use? I just feel so dirty what with the sweating and running from those things outside.\u201d\n\nYou expect catty remarks or a few insults or some sort of hostility, but you\u2019re met with a surprise.\n\n\u201cWhy sure blondie. You can use the small shower we have for us in the back. You need a change of clothes too?\u201d Anne says.\n\u201cYou have some?\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019re extra waitress uniforms. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cSure, if it\u2019s clean it\u2019ll be a welcome change.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, hmm you\u2019re a bit on the small side, Jasmine, go get Trudy\u2019s old uniform. That should fit\u2026Suzy wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and thank you.\u201d\n\nSoon, Jasmine returns to give you a uniform and you\u2019re on your way to get washed up. The waitresses\u2019 private bathroom isn\u2019t much but the fact it has a shower that you can use to get clean is enough for you.\n\nYou feel a little odd wearing the uniform, which was obviously designed to attract a lot of male attention, but again you\u2019re just glad to be out of those old dirty clothes.\n\nBy the time you get out of the shower, the waitresses are cooking up dinner for everyone. You ask if they need any help, but they say they got it.\n\nYou sit down and eat, a couple people make a bit of small talk, but nothing of importance. You mostly are left alone, but it\u2019s a promising start at least. In any event the re-invigorated feeling you had after the shower is wearing off and you start to get tired which is when you ask Anne where the sleeping area is.\n\n\u201cWell some people are flopping right out here in these booths. A few really brave souls are sleeping out in their trucks out there. Henry\u2019s got his own private office as you might expect. The wait staff has that small lounge area near our bathroom\u2026though Jasmine is using one of the storerooms since she\u2019s got her kids with her. I guess you could take one these booths or share the storeroom with Jasmine. Of course you\u2019ve got that boyfriend\u2026hmmm could give you the second storeroom. Doesn\u2019t really have a lot of space though.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I just want some where to rest.\u201d\n\nAnd once again you succeed in a simple task with no major problems. Things have been going so well for you since you got here that you almost forget about the problems of the outside world going on. You don\u2019t of course, but you honestly can say this is the safest you\u2019ve felt since you left your basement.\n\nGiving you a spare blanket, Anne directs you to the second storeroom, which is indeed lacking in space but it\u2019s enough for you. You waste no time in laying down your blanket and falling asleep on the floor.", "action_results": [{"action": "The next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body grinding up against you, an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section and warm breath blowing in your ear in between the kissing.\n\nNot exactly what you expected, but it beats those Ground Zero advertisements.\n\n\u201cWell, looks like someone is feeling friendly this morning. When did you get here?\u201d You ask.\n\u201cA little after midnight. It was boring and I would\u2019ve rather been with you, but at least I didn\u2019t see any of those things. You of course were already asleep so I just slept besides you the whole night. You\u2019re a pretty sound sleeper, you didn\u2019t even wake up.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cHrm. Surprised you didn\u2019t take advantage of my vulnerable situation.\u201d\n\u201cI thought about it, but honestly by that time I was pretty tired myself. I actually haven\u2019t been awake long. So they make you a waitress to help out around here?\u201d\n\u201cOh. This? No. They were just good enough to let me borrow some clean clothes. I won\u2019t say everyone here has been social with me, but at least nobody has been hostile.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well you look hot in that uniform.\u201d Roger says and resumes groping you.\n\u201cOh? You like this? Got a role play fetish eh?\u201d\n\u201cSure, and its short so I\u2019ll be able to hike the skirt up for easy access.\u201d\n\u201cWell that definitely is the practical side to it.\u201d You chuckle.\n\nYour laughter is turned to semi-surprise when Roger moves one of his hands under your skirt. You didn\u2019t quite expect him to go there so quickly, but it isn\u2019t unwelcome.\n\n\u201cMmm yeah\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been like a whole week that you\u2019ve gone without pleasuring yourself (let alone had anyone else do it) so as far as you\u2019re concerned you\u2019re about due.\n\nYou quickly start to undo Roger\u2019s pants and few moments later your legs are wrapped around him and he\u2019s thrusting into you.\n\n\u201cOh shit this feels so fucking good\u2026\u201d you exclaim.\n\nHonestly that\u2019s not all you say. You say quite a few things fairly loudly and you don\u2019t really care if anyone hears you. (Roger on the other hand is a bit more on the quiet side)\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time passes because you\u2019re enjoying yourself so much and then you feel it.\n\n\u201cOh my God! I\u2019m almost there! Keep doing that! Harder! Faster! Oh yessss\u2026\u201d you exclaim and then the explosion.\n\nThough not that one.\n\nThere\u2019s a loud noise and a faint rumble, but you don\u2019t really pay it any mind because you and Roger are more focused on the task involving each other\u2019s fun parts.\n\nA few moments later and someone starts banging on the door. At first you think its someone that\u2019s complaining about you being too noisy, but they start yelling you two need to come out now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fucking nuke going off in distance!\u201d the voice yells.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Roger exclaims.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d You say.\n\u201cI said there\u2019s a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah I heard! (Sigh) Hold on.\u201d Roger interrupts.\n\nThat must\u2019ve been the rumble and noise from earlier. Talk about a mood breaker.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI guess so. Shit\u2026I hope it wasn\u2019t too close.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cWe\u2019d be all vaporized if it was a big one, so maybe it was just a little one?\u201d\n\u201cThe one they dropped on Hiroshima was a little one too.\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose there\u2019s not much for it now. Our building is still intact so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d You say trying not to wonder if you\u2019re still going to be in the range of a fatal dose of radiation.\n\nRoger starts to slowly get his pants back on and you pull your skirt back down.\n\nWhen you both leave the room, you see Jasmine trying to calm her children down. A couple people are arguing. A few are just sitting in a silent state of shock. Henry is actually outside the diner looking in the direction of where the bomb must\u2019ve gone off. You can see the lingering remnants of a mushroom cloud in the far distance even from inside the diner. You can\u2019t help but hold on the Roger a bit tightly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know how far or how big the bomb was, but I do know it went off in the direction of Fort Timons. Hell, that might\u2019ve even been the target. Well either that or the city. Either way both of those places are probably radioactive ruins now and it looks like you saved my life too.\u201d Roger says squeezing you around the waist.\n\u201cYou think maybe this was just a way to get rid of those infected people? Maybe this is only occurring on a small scale?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe, but I get the impression this bomb was just one of many to the nuclear end of the big war that the Ground Zero ads kept going on about. Guess it doesn\u2019t matter because I imagine things are going to be severely changing and the world as we once knew it is going to be much different. Harder for one thing.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly as frightening as this event is, you aren\u2019t as filled with dread as you normally would be. Maybe its because after all the other craziness you went through this week, you could\u2019ve ended up a lot worse off. Maybe you\u2019re finally trying to find the silver lining for once in your life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll handle it\u2026together.\u201d You say with certainty.\n\nRoger looks at you and nods.\n\n\u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nAt this point Henry steps back in the diner and after calming some of the arguing truckers. He begins addressing the situation and stating that nothing has changed and that the situation is still the same, namely if people help, then they are welcome to stay. If not or if they don\u2019t want to stay then they are free to go.\n\nA couple of the truckers who apparently have families elsewhere do leave. Everyone else stays and the work towards creating a permanent new \u201chome\u201d is begun.\n\nWhile you\u2019re pitching in by doing inventory on the medical supplies you have you briefly wonder what would\u2019ve happened had you not abandoned the carnival when you did. Could you have made a difference had you stayed like Roofie wanted you to?\n\nYou shake your head. You don\u2019t mind helping out, but you know you\u2019re no leader. Better to be safe and be around a group that you at least feel more comfortable around and so far that\u2019s what you\u2019ve encountered here at this truck stop. Most people here despite the highly stressful situation have still been pleasant with you.\n\nFunny where one finds a place to belong.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Nice and Safe\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\n\u201cTake it or leave it. Don\u2019t have all day to haggle with you.\u201d You say to the scavenger.\n\nHe looks at the plastic bag of 9mm ammo for a moment.\n\n\u201cAlright I\u2019ll take it.\u201d He says and hands over two damaged rifles and takes the ammo without another word and leaves.\n\nYou look at the rifles again and think how glad you are to have someone who has a natural affinity to fixing thing.\n\n\u201cDaniel! Come out here, got a project for you.\u201d\n\nYou son comes out from his work area to see what you\u2019re yelling at him about this time.\n\n\u201cMom, what is it now?\u201d Daniel replies.\n\u201cHere. Got more rifles you can fix and we can sell for better profit later on.\u201d You say and pass the rifles to him.\n\u201cThese need new bolts. I\u2019m not sure if I have any spare ones. At least not for two rifles.\u201d\n\u201cWell do what you can. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something. You usually do. Besides you know how everyone that comes through this place is always interested in weapons. If you get just one of them fixed, it\u2019ll still be a profit for what we got them for.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t most people buy their weapons from Earl on the far side of the bazaar?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but he specializes in that, the beauty of what we do is sell and buy a little bit of everything. So someone who might be looking for medicine might also end up buying a gun too. Besides, he\u2019s getting a reputation of ripping people off, so we need to be prepared for the possible day for when people start coming to us to buy their guns instead.\u201d\n\nDaniel nods and says nothing else. He isn\u2019t really much of a talker or a thinker for that matter. Not that the boy is stupid, its just he focuses on other things. Like fixing. Sometimes he reminds you a bit of your older brother\u2019s son from the old days. That boy was definitely a savant.\n\nDaniel head back to his workstation. You\u2019re so glad you\u2019ve never had problems with him, though Roger thinks he should mix more with people\u2026but then you remember your own isolationist days in a certain basement and laugh to yourself.\n\nCompared to you back then, Daniel is a social butterfly and has an actual trade. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\nReally its odd to you sometimes that you basically run the equivalent of a post apocalyptic general store, but as this place got bigger and better fortified, the original people began to rise in status and responsibility and here you are.\n\nIt certainly is better than being a wanderer out there. You\u2019ve heard the tales and have no desire to leave the walls of New Security. Its safe here and you have everything you\u2019d ever want.\n\nIt\u2019s your new basement.\n\nYou remember Roger wanting to lead the New Security recon team when it was formed, but you managed to talk him out of that nonsense. You didn\u2019t talk him into staying here in the first place and avoid getting nuked to atoms just so he could go play wasteland warrior and get his head blown off that way.\n\nHis job as lead protector of New Security holds more than enough danger and a test of his skills.\n\n\u201cHey mom, how\u2019s business?\u201d Cindy asks walking in.\n\u201cFine. I\u2019m guessing you went with your father today?\u201d\n\u201cYep. It was really cool. I got to learn how to shoot. I even killed something!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\nAt this point Roger walks in and has heard the end of the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a person and she wasn\u2019t in any danger. It was just a large rat that had wandered on the range. She got it in right in the head on one shot. She\u2019s a natural.\u201d Roger says in an effort to reassure you.\n\nYou know it\u2019s a harsh new world now, and you know your daughter learning how to shoot is probably one of the best things for her, but you can\u2019t help worry.\n\n\u201cWell, glad to hear you had fun.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah! I even got to see the New Security Scout Team coming in from a mission! They said they had to fight a mutant! Sounded exciting! I can\u2019t wait to be able to become one of them one day!\u201d\n\nWell now you\u2019re worried and Roger already knows it.\n\n\u201cUh, Cindy why don\u2019t you go into the back, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be eating soon.\u201d Roger says. Cindy complies, but she knows all too well an argument is going to be occurring soon.\n\nYou give Roger that \u201clook\u201d that he knows all to well is one of displeasure.\n\n\u201cSuzy, before you even start I really did not put that idea into her head! I didn\u2019t even know the scout team was coming back today! Let alone that she was going to bump into them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the head protector! How would you not know that?!\u201d you say.\n\u201cHey, I take care of internal safety first. Besides, sometimes the scouts come back early if they don\u2019t find anything out there.\u201d\n\u201cA mutant sounds like something to me. Look I know Cindy\u2019s a teenager and I know she finds all this military type stuff exciting, but I\u2019d at least rather not encourage her desire to want to go traipsing about the wasteland.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019d rather her be safe too, I mean that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to teach her how to shoot and other skills. I mean we can only guide so much and eventually she\u2019s going to be an adult and we won\u2019t have any control over what she does. You know that.\u201d\n\nThis is an old argument and Roger is right, but you really wish he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI know. I know. Just\u2026(sigh) could you at least next time emphasize that being a scout isn\u2019t as glamorous as it sounds?\u201d\n\u201cThat I can do. Can\u2019t promise you it\u2019ll work, but I\u2019ll definitely do that.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the best I can hope for.\u201d\n\nRoger moves in to kiss you and you return it.\n\n\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t see why SHE gets to be in the scout team when I\u2019m not a allowed to.\u201d Roger says with a smile.\n\nYou laugh and you close up the store so that you can spend time with your family.\n\nIt\u2019s not the easiest life, but it\u2019s more than you ever had before.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Continue to Fort Timons", "result": "While you probably could talk Roger into staying if you turned on the charm again, you\u2019ve done enough of that for quite some time and honestly he might be right as far as safety is concerned.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the people here, this truck stop is still open enough that those things could get in. (Crawl under the trucks for one thing) Also while the owner seems cool, you don\u2019t know everyone else and the last time you encountered a cool owner was the carnival and you know how that turned out. You also imagine that a military base might indeed survive an extended siege a lot better than this place.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I still think going to Timons is a better idea than staying here. I\u2019m going, so if you want to stay\u2026\u201d Roger says before you interrupt him.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought you thought it was a bad idea.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I still sort of do, but I guess if this is a major crisis and the end of civilization, I\u2019d rather be with you. So if you believe we\u2019ll be safe there, then I believe we\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nRoger smiles at that remark. He immediately goes to hug you, which you weren\u2019t quite expecting, but you hug back. You suppose you are getting attached to him. Just a sucker for men who save your life you guess.\n\nAfter this happy experience Roger goes over to gas up the truck and you wait nearby. You don\u2019t even notice Henry come up to you.\n\n\u201cSo you two decide on what to do yet?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah we\u2019re going to try to make it to Timons.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well I wish you luck on that. Too bad you\u2019re not staying though, could use a few more people to guard this place and help out around here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I wish we were staying too, but well he wants to go to Fort Timons so that means we\u2019re both going.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well love for another always has a way of making you act out of character.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2026eah something like that I guess.\u201d You say reluctantly. Henry still hasn\u2019t caught on that you aren\u2019t really \u201cwith\u201d Roger, but you don\u2019t bother correcting him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you got this big truck, so you should be safe as long as you don\u2019t get out of the thing or stop for a long period of time to let those things swarm you. And despite my doom and gloom earlier, don\u2019t take that as truth. I mean what do I know. I\u2019m stuck here with a Ham Radio that I can barely get to work right at the best of times. Things might not be as bad as they seem. Who knows? Maybe this will all be over in a day or two.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, one can only hope.\u201d You say.\n\u201cRemember though, if Timons doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019re welcome to come back here.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Henry that\u2019s very generous of you.\u201d\n\nAfter your short talk with Henry, Roger is ready to get going again and you\u2019ve got the fuel to get to your destination.\n\n\u201cWe left you those MREs and the water. No need to leave you without the basics. Anyway, like I told your pretty girlfriend here, I wish you luck and if it doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019re welcome to come back here.\u201d Henry tells Roger\n\u201cThank you and we\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d Roger replies and drives off towards the \u201ctruck gate\u201d which is now opening up.\n\nAnd with that you\u2019re on the road again.\n\n\u201cHey I just want you to know, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re coming with me. I mean I know you didn\u2019t want to and\u2026look I think you know I really like you and it\u2019s not just because you flirted with me and I saw you naked and all that. I really enjoy your company. Probably not the best time to be addressing all this shit, but I think its better I just tell you where I stand right now. Especially with everything that\u2019s going on. Anyway that\u2019s all I want to say and I\u2019ll drop the subject.\u201d Roger says.\n\nYou\u2019re having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment like when Klepto admitted all his feelings for you, though with Roger it feels a little different. You get a little more sincerity with him. Klepto was always a little too sycophantic as far you were concerned.\n\nHell, maybe you didn\u2019t just decide to go off with Roger out of survival. Here or even back at the carnival. Maybe somewhere you did have an attraction to him and you just denied it for some reason. It\u2019s that damn \u201cgood girl\u201d trait you never shook off from your mother drilling it into your head when you were growing up.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I like and feel close to you too Roger.\u201d You say and smile back at Roger.\n\nWith this acknowledgement of your feelings for each other, a good period of your drive is in silence, but not an awkward silence, a comfortable one.\n\nThe silence isn\u2019t just going on in the truck, it\u2019s also going on outside or least relatively speaking. Despite what Henry said, so far you haven\u2019t encountered any hordes of those rabid things and you\u2019re driving through suburbs by this point. You also haven\u2019t seen many people walking about, but you assume most people are taking shelter somewhere.\n\nHappily the streets aren\u2019t clogged with abandoned vehicles. That was one thing that Roger was more worried about. A line of vehicles is a little harder to drive over even with a big truck.\n\nNight comes and the rabid are a little bit more active though nothing that can\u2019t be handled. Most of the time Roger just drives past them and they give chase for a while, but sometimes he runs them over.\n\n\u201cSheesh, they are getting thicker. Glad we don\u2019t actually have to go INTO Security. Pftt, Security. Now that\u2019s an ironic name for the city. Anyway we should actually get to Fort Timons around two or three in the morning.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cGlad to hear it. I\u2019m getting tired, but I\u2019m too on edge to sleep.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEh, go ahead and close your eyes at least. I\u2019ll try to keep the zombie smashing to a minimum.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t zombies, I think we established that they\u2019re living right?\u201d\n\u2018Yeah, pretty sure they\u2019re all alive, just rabid. Or whatever is wrong with them. Dunno if they infect anyone though, don\u2019t want to ever find that out.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\u201d You reply and then try to take Roger\u2019s advice by closing your eyes.\n\nYou don\u2019t really sleep so much as you rest and sort of drift in and out. You aren\u2019t fully awake again until Roger calls your attention to your destination which isn\u2019t far now.\n\n\u201cHa ha! Suzy wake up! We\u2019re here! We made it and look they even got the towers lit up! The fort still stands!\u201d he exclaims in joy.\n\u201cHuh, yeah. That\u2019s really\u2026\u201d before you can finish your groggy words Roger has stopped the truck, grabbed you and kisses you full on the lips. You\u2019re too tired to resist, though you wouldn\u2019t have bother anyway.\n\n\u201cWell was it everything you expected?\u201d you ask after he\u2019s done.\n\u201cEven better!\u201d Roger says and then tries to kiss you again.\n\u201cWhoa, hold on there, let\u2019s save the victory kissing until AFTER we get in this place. I mean how do we even know they\u2019ll let us in?\u201d\n\u201cOh we\u2019ll get in, I know we will.\u201d Roger says and starts up the truck again.\n\nYou get within range and suddenly spotlights move in your direction and a loud speaker calls out for you slow your speed to a crawl and to stop at the gates and to prepare to be inspected. Roger complies and soon you\u2019re sitting before the gates of Fort Timons.\n\nYou can imagine snipers from the towers are pointing their weapons on you and when the gates open a whole damn squad of soldiers comes out. A young man with glasses comes up to the driver\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cRiley? Is that you? Holy shit, we thought your squad was dead.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me Keller and I\u2019m the only survivor. You\u2019ll never believe what the hell happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiley?\u201d you think, but then you realize that must be his last name. In fact it\u2019s right on his shirt. Funny how you never noticed before. Never noticed he was a corporal either.\n\n\u201cWell there\u2019s been a lot going on here too, so probably won\u2019t be too surprised. Anyway Captain Higgins will want to see you. Uh, he\u2019s in charge now.\u201d Keller says.\n\u201cShit, I guess a lot has changed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, who\u2019s this in your passenger side?\u201d\n\u201cThis is Suzy. She actually saved my life out there. Don\u2019t worry she\u2019s not bit or infected or anything.\u201d\n\u201cGuess you never had to suffer it first hand, but if you\u2019re referring to those rabid, they don\u2019t infect you if they bite. One good thing about all this I suppose. Saved your life eh? How\u2019d that happen?\u201d\n\u201cOh I got something surprised when I first encountered one of those things and it was on top of me snarling and growling. Suzy here got a knife and stabbed it in the face. Just enough for me to put it down permanently with a few rounds to its head and body.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m also his girlfriend!\u201d you add, hoping that by having a closer tie to Roger that they\u2019ll let you in.\n\u201cGirlfriend? Hrm. I guess stressful situations really do cause close bonds. Well under normal circumstances we wouldn\u2019t let a civvie in that isn\u2019t blood related or your spouse, but I guess we can make an exception. All right come on in. Don\u2019t want to risk having this gate open any longer than it needs to be.\u201d\n\nAs you drive in you at last feel safer than you have been in a long while. Roger and you both exit the vehicle and Roger tells you that some people will probably take you to the barracks or some place with a bed. He says he\u2019ll meet up with you later as he has to go report in.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d You say and you move in to kiss him goodbye.\n\nWell if you weren\u2019t his girlfriend before, you certainly cemented it now.\n\nYou are escorted to a barracks area just as Roger said you would be, but it\u2019s mostly empty. The two soldiers that escort you mention that most of people stationed here never came back after being sent to the city, so there\u2019s a lot of room now. They don\u2019t say much else and soon leave you to your own devices.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time during this hellish week, you\u2019re alone. It\u2019s almost a bit scary, but in a way you\u2019ve missed it. You\u2019re too tired though to really appreciate it and you collapse on one of the beds and start to drift off\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "The next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body grinding up against you, an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section and warm breath blowing in your ear in between the kissing.\n\nNot exactly what you expected, but it beats those Ground Zero advertisements.\n\n\u201cWha the\u2026Roger that better be you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOf course its me. Who else would it be? Bobby?\u201d Roger answers.\n\u201cWell I couldn\u2019t tell, your erection pressing into me feels to be about the same size.\u201d\n\u201cWow\u2026 way to make a guy feel special.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be sensitive, I could\u2019ve said it was smaller. Anyway, isn\u2019t there some sort of protocol against this in the barracks?\u201d you say turning you head.\n\u201cPfft, protocol isn\u2019t what it used to be. If you haven\u2019t noticed there isn\u2019t even anyone using this one, except you and barring an assault on this place, the captain was good enough to give me a day to rest up before going back on duty full time. Higgins always was cool about things, glad he\u2019s in charge now.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, so what\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing important, just holding out until we re-establish contact with the government I guess. Higgins might be cool about certain things, but he said he really couldn\u2019t give out any more information other than the infected humans are not going to be a threat to us as long as we stay in the base. All the units that were sent out into the city were long since asked to pull back here though obviously not a lot made it back and there has been no contact with any of the units sent to your town.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, guess we both got really lucky. I spoke with some of the guys and a lot are still shaken up about stuff that went down in the city. It\u2019s times like this that make you really glad to be alive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess we are survivors.\u201d You say and for a moment you lie with Roger finally feeling totally safe from the horrors that are occurring outside right now. You haven\u2019t felt this way since you left your basement.\n\nYour moment is then broken by Roger resuming his groping and kissing on you.\n\n\u201cMmm, you smell so good right now\u2026\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cSmell good? I haven\u2019t had a proper shower in days! Nevermind the fact I\u2019ve been running and sweating in the same clothes. I\u2019m disgusting, I\u2019d ask how you\u2019re even getting turned on by me right now, but I probably do smell like roses compared to you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, come on let\u2019s go use the shower together.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026NOW? I mean those things are open, what if someone walks in on us?\u201d\n\u201cNobody will. I told you, there isn\u2019t even anyone here in this area. Besides we can make it quick.\u201d\n\u201cQuick. Just what every girl wants to hear\u2026(snort) don\u2019t you think this is all a little presumptuous of you anyway? I said I liked and felt close to you, when did I say I was going to fuck you?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I helped you escape.\u201d Roger says continuing to kiss on you.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s low\u2026\u201d you chuckle. \u201cSo is this more about me owing you something? Is that the way you want it?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\u201cFuck it, I was tired of playing hard to get anyway. It\u2019s been several days since I\u2019ve even managed to pleasure myself so I\u2019m about due. Come on let\u2019s go hit the showers.\u201d You say and get off the bed.\n\nYou and Roger go to the nearby shower room. The pair of you are stripping your clothes off on your way there. By the time you\u2019ve turned on the water, the both of you are naked.\n\nYou enjoy both the force of the cleansing water hitting the front of your body as well as the force of Roger hitting your girl parts from the back. One of his hands starts to grope your breasts while his other remains gripped at your side.\n\nEvery thrust feels like a great release from the stress you\u2019ve endured this week. You scream out in ecstasy for more and you don\u2019t give a shit how loud you are and who might hear you. You just hope Roger\u2019s got that military stamina to go the distance.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much time passes because you\u2019re enjoying yourself so much and then you feel it.\n\n\u201cOh my God! I\u2019m almost there! Keep doing that! Harder! Faster! Oh yessss\u2026\u201d you exclaim and then the explosion.\n\nNamely the nuclear bomb that explodes over the base.\n\nWhether this seemingly insignificant military base was a legitimate target or a misalignment from hitting the city of Security (Which probably still got hit too) is irrelevant.\n\nWho launched the nuke is irrelevant.\n\nWhy it was launched is irrelevant.\n\nWhat is relevant is that you, Roger and many others with the large radius of this blast are instantly vaporized.\n\nAt least you went out with a bang.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Stay in the tent", "result": "While it might be an opportunity to escape, you\u2019re not going to risk it. Roger might be a little smitten with you, but he\u2019s athletic enough looking that you don\u2019t think you could easily fight him off if something went wrong. Given that there is a state of martial law right now, you\u2019re likely to get yourself shot or worse.\n\nBetter to stay in the tent and come up with a plan where you at least might have some back up.\n\nSo you\u2019re currently back to square one, sitting around doing much of nothing until the National Guard decides to leave (whenever if and when that happens).\n\nYou spend most of your time thinking on what Roofie said and your current position at the carnival. The only way you\u2019re ever going to have safety and have a family is if you take direct action towards those goals.\n\n\u201cLifto, Shrimpy, you\u2019re with me.\u201d You suddenly say and say you going to see the head of the dwarf faction.\n\u201cUh, I dunno if that\u2019s a good idea, he\u2019s been doing a lot of preparation lately.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has, and its in our best interest to find out exactly what that is. Maybe YOU can afford to play both sides, but I\u2019m not taking that chance.\u201d You say and start walking over to the crowd of little people.\n\nAs you approach, the dwarves instantly start closing ranks and their demeanor changes to a defensive one.\n\n\u201cBack again Shrimpy? I didn\u2019t anticipate your sycophantic antics for another hour or so. And you must be Suzy, the new clown girl that\u2019s been pissing off all the ladies and turning on all the guys. Hrm. Upon a closer look, I understand the appeal, but you\u2019re still no dwarf woman.\u201d an older dwarf says, though many of his fellows probably don\u2019t share that opinion.\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re the leader of your group?\u201d\n\u201cYep, though I don\u2019t suppose Shrimpy\u2019s bothered to mention my name is Billy. If you\u2019re here about our current alliance, you needn\u2019t worry since I\u2019ve reassured Shrimpy so many times about it that it\u2019s getting to the point of annoyance. Glad to you at least changed it up by appearing yourself, could\u2019ve done without the big ugly clown behind you though, but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s a poor attempt at intimidation.\u201d\n\u201cA girl likes to have a big strong man to watch her back sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve practically begged a bunch of little men to do it to eh? Let\u2019s cut to the chase, what do you really want? I already know that you\u2019re the new leader of the clowns given what you did to old Roofie over there. Bet he didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know how else to put it so you just say it, which comes to a surprise to Shrimpy and Lifto as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be the new leader of this carnival and YOU\u2019RE going to support me in this endeavor.\u201d\nBilly smiles at this remark and then chuckles. Several of the other dwarves do likewise.\n\n\u201cYou? Really? And you think we\u2019re just going to support you in this? I hope you had a better plan than preparing to fuck every munchkin in munchkin land Dorothy, because at this juncture I guarantee that would be the ONLY way that you MIGHT come close to your dreams of being in charge. And if that was your plan, you can forget it, because I\u2019m happily married. However, it might gain you favor with some of my friends. Could ensure that your group will have a place in the new carnival order that will be coming soon, but that\u2019s a choice you\u2019ll have to make on your own.\u201d\n\u201cYou really think the rest of the carnival is going to follow you?\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t have a choice, we dwarves have always been the backbone of it and it\u2019s about time we just took the spotlight. Just like my Great Uncle Charley always wanted to do so long ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and apparently that didn\u2019t work out so well given your current situation. You know why? Nobody truly respects you. They\u2019re content to let you do the grunt work, but they don\u2019t want you to be in the spotlight, unless you\u2019re making a fool of yourself like Shrimpy here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cWatch your tone there blondie, you\u2019re starting to tread on very dangerous ground.\u201d Billy warns.\n\u201cYes, I know and I\u2019m also trying to explain that you\u2019re ALREADY in control by being the backbone of the carnival. You might very well be able to win this internal struggle, but would there be anything left? This place has languished under Roofie, obviously, but it could be great again if it had the right ring master. Someone who could bring in the people. You said it yourself, I\u2019ve got most of the guys here salivating over me just by my presence. You know how advertising works, I bring \u2018em in with a wink, a smile and some sweet talk, the other performers get the money out of them and someone has to keep the infrastructure together and that\u2019s you. We could work together as a more than just co-workers we could be like\u2026a family. Like how carnies are supposed to really stick together.\u201d\n\nYour words give a moment of pause for Billy who ponders them for a moment, but then shakes his head.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, that\u2019s a really good speech, the problem is you haven\u2019t been here but a few days and you\u2019re already trying to take over. In family terms, you\u2019re like the hot twenty year old nurse that married great grandpa on his death bed in the hopes of inheriting everything despite the fact he\u2019s got a multitude of family members that are far more deserving since they had to put up with his shit a lot longer. Now that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think you\u2019re sincere or even that your idea isn\u2019t a worthy one, its just I don\u2019t see YOU as that potential leader. If this carnival does split apart after the dust clears, well maybe it was meant to be, but I\u2019m not spending the remainder of my life following another half-assed leader again. So to sum up, if you want to be on our side then great, if not, then I highly suggest you all get in your clown car and all get jobs at a rodeo or something.\u201d\n\nAt this point Billy\u2019s done talking and waves you all away.\n\nWell that could\u2019ve went better.\n\n\u201cAre you nuts?! Why the hell did you do that for? You\u2019re lucky he isn\u2019t cancelling our protection!\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t say it was the best of moves, but I guess you had to try.\u201d Lifto says.\n\nBetween Shrimpy\u2019s concern for his own self-preservation and Lifto\u2019s impotent comment, you\u2019re wondering if you shouldn\u2019t re-consider trying to escape again.\n\nUltimately you all head back to the table where upon Shrimpy and Lifto explain what happened. Fatty and Klepto are both surprised by your actions, but Klepto again makes the usual attempt at being more \u201cunderstanding\u201d than the others. Christ, he never quits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need this right now, I\u2019m going to be by myself.\u201d You say grabbing the small radio that they were listening to and head to where Roofie is still lying on his mat with his eyes closed. You don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still awake or genuinely asleep now, but he at least doesn\u2019t appear to be in any mood to bother you right now.\n\nYou spend a few more hours listening to one of the radios while the others play cards and try to talk about mundane things. You\u2019re not getting the best reception and it\u2019s no Internet, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nYou mostly listen to a lot of special breaking news talking about how bad things are getting in various parts of the world. You hear about the riots going on and think about your own town and how your \u201creal\u201d family is doing. Ben\u2019s hidden personal bomb shelter was somewhere in the backyard, you wonder if you shouldn\u2019t have just tried to look for it and moved in there, it probably was stocked.\n\nThen as the sun starts setting, you hear a bunch of shooting and shouting outside. You see the other guardsmen near the tent entrance rush off, leaving everyone unsupervised.\n\nNaturally no longer being supervised means chaos within the tent begins to erupt though you have no idea why people aren\u2019t more concerned about why the National Guardsmen are shooting and yelling at something outside.\n\nLacking any better idea, you try to wake up Roofie, but he doesn\u2019t stir.\n\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nApparently his last words to you WERE his dying request literally.\n\nWhile you\u2019re the only one aware of poor Roofie\u2019s unexpected passing, a full on fight in the tent breaks out. Predictably, it\u2019s Razor and her faction vs. Billy and his faction. Some of the smaller factions join in while others just run out of the tent altogether. It\u2019s very lucky that your group is nowhere near the center of the tent where the fighting is and more or less in a corner.\n\n\u201cSuzy! It\u2019s begun!\u201d Lifto shouts.\n\u201cYeah! We need to get in and help Billy or we\u2019re going to be next!\u201d Shrimpy adds.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Billy", "result": "With all the gunfire going on outside, you don\u2019t exactly feel as if that would be any safer. Better help Billy for now.\n\nYou all approach the massive brawl, but none of you save for Lifto has any real desire or ability to fight. Shrimpy finds a place to hide and occasionally throws something at someone, Klepto gets knocked out by one of Phil\u2019s crew and its only with the help of Lifto that he doesn\u2019t get his face stomped in. Fatty does a little better due to his size, but he\u2019s not much in the endurance area and has to stop to catch his breath every few minutes (which results in someone inevitably trying to attack him)\n\nYou try to stay out of it and maintain a close distance to either the dwarves or Lifto. You occasionally point out potential dangers and sometimes even manage to club someone in the head with a juggling pin you found on the ground, but you\u2019re nowhere near in the thick of it.\n\nWhile all this is going on, you notice a decrease in the gunfire from outside and a lot more screaming and groaning. Through the chaos you see Roger staggering just outside the tent and collapsing near the entrance of it. Seeing that you\u2019re not really affecting the \u201cpower struggle\u201d you rush over to Roger to see what the hell happened out side the tent.\n\nWhen you get to Roger, you notice he\u2019s badly wounded and bleeding a lot. You don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to make it.\n\n\u201cRoger! What the hell\u2026what happened?!\u201d\n\u201c(Gasp) They\u2026just\u2026came out of nowhere\u2026(gasp) a bunch of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! What came out?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. Ugggh\u2026hurts\u2026(gasp) they were insane looking\u2026snarling, biting\u2026\u201d\n\nYou notice that most of Roger\u2019s wounds do look like bite marks. You can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re even pondering this, but\u2026\n\u201cShit, Roger, are you telling me you just got attacked by\u2026fucking zombies?\u201d\n\nAt this point Roger doesn\u2019t respond he\u2019s falling unconscious and his breathing is getting short. You attempt to sit him up and smack him awake, but nothing is working. He\u2019s going to die and if your vast knowledge of zombie movies is any indication he\u2019s going to soon become on as well.\n\nThat\u2019s the least of your concerns however since while you\u2019re holding on to Roger, one the \u201czombies\u201d that Roger alluded to suddenly comes out from behind one of the parked military vehicles. It doesn\u2019t see you immediately, but it will if you hang around out here.\n\nStanding up and backing away from Roger\u2019s soon to be lifeless body and trying to get back in the tent, you bump into another equally unpleasant individual and no less dangerous. Her face is bloody and several of her piercings have been pulled out, but if she\u2019s out here that can only mean she won.\n\n\u201cThere you are, clown bitch. I was hoping to get the pleasure to beat your blonde ass myself, too bad Wanda the Red caught a knife to the throat because it might\u2019ve been fun to watch her anally rape you with her twelve inch strap on before I kicked the shit out of you.\u201d Razor remarks.\n\u201cRazor, there are zom\u2026there are some insane people that just\u2026\u201d you start to say and then Razor punches you across the face, knocking you to the ground.\n\nWhile you\u2019re holding the side of your face, Razor pulls out a bloody straight razor.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t plan on killing you, I just plan on making you the first in our brand new freakshow!\u201d Razor says and is about to get on top of you to carry out her promise, but all your survival instincts kick in and you scream and kick at her. If she were a man, you would\u2019ve gotten in a couple good ball kicks. Eventually she grabs one of your legs with one arm.\n\n\u201cGood! Struggle bitch, this is just making it more fun for me. Ain\u2019t nobody gonna save you anyway. Everyone else is licking their wounds or dead! The carnival is under my control now!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t screaming for someone in carnival to save me.\u201d You say.\n\nRazor is confused by your remark only because she\u2019s been so focused on doing harm to you that she\u2019s completely ignored her surroundings. Not only did the zombie hear your scream, but so did several of his fellows and unfortunately for Razor they\u2019re the fast variety.\n\nThe one that was near the military vehicle is already upon Razor by the time she does look up and two more are loping quickly behind. You quickly scramble into the tent hoping that the dead that Razor mentioned inside aren\u2019t turning and this is a \u201cbite style\u201d infection.\n\nRazor wasn\u2019t kidding when she mentioned people either being wounded or dead. Granted there are more than a few people in fair condition, but resting from the past brawl is more of a priority right now. Too bad for them that isn\u2019t an option.\n\n\u201cOh god! Hel\u2026 AGGGGGH!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear that? That\u2019s the sound of your short-lived leader getting ripped to shreds by cannibal freaks. So if you idiots are done killing each other over power, you better get ready to kill for survival!\u201d you shout and grab the nearest blunt object as you hear the screams of Razor being presumably eaten alive outside.\n\nNo sooner have you grabbed a piece of chair leg, one of the zombies rushes in. You manage to bash it once across the head and then again before it goes down. It grabs at your feet and you\u2019re about to smash your improvised club on it, when Shrimpy suddenly has run up and done it for you with a juggling pin. You both at that point keep hitting the thing until its brains are mush and it isn\u2019t moving anymore.\n\n\u201c(Whew) Thanks Shrimpy. Glad to see you survived.\u201d\n\u201cYou as well, what the hell are\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLater, Shrimp. Concentrate!\u201d you say as the other two zombies come lurching in. Fortunately at this point you and Shrimpy get a little more back up from some of the other carnies and luckily nobody else gets hurt.\n\nAfter killing the pair of them, you\u2019re suddenly bombarded by questions about what the hell they are. The only thing you can think of is zombies, but after a bit of cautious investigation by some of you, you start to wonder if that\u2019s even accurate.\n\nYou come to several fortunate conclusions and discoveries.\n\nFirst of all it looks like there aren\u2019t anymore of those things alive anymore and the National Guard are all dead as well. So those dangers are out of the way.\n\nSecond, nobody dead has come back to life, (bitten or not) so at least this isn\u2019t contagious whatever it is. In fact you see one of the \u201czombies\u201d laying dead with several bullet wounds to the chest and no head wound, so you don\u2019t think these things are undead at least. But the fact that you\u2019ve got crazed cannibal people running loose is still cause for concern!\n\nAs you, Shrimpy and several others continue to cautiously investigate outside the tent, Shrimpy mentions some bad news while you two are away from the group. Namely Lifto, Fatty, Billy and Roofie were all dead, though you mention you already knew about Roofie.\n\n\u201cYeah, the old guy died peacefully in his sleep I guess. Probably best that he did just before what happened. So what about Klepto?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh he\u2019s still alive. He\u2019s still unconscious, from that first hit, but he\u2019s still alive. Hey, I meant to say I\u2019m sorry about being so self-serving like I was, before all this went down Suzy. I guess I just got scared.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s in the past now. Besides you came through for me when I really needed it. So you said Billy\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that bitch Razor got him just as he was finishing off Wanda the Red. As you might expect the remaining dwarves are pretty broken up about it. But then I guess Razor\u2019s dead too, so I\u2019m not sure where that leaves us.\u201d\n\u201cA possible opportunity I\u2019d say. Looks like the National Guard left a lot of supplies that could be useful in the near future. Come on let\u2019s head back.\u201d You say and pick up one of the rifles. Laying on the ground nearby.\n\nWhen you get back to the tent, people haven\u2019t moved much from their original positions though the medical supplies taken from one of the military trucks should help patch up the wounded.\n\nYou stand in front of everyone and give a speech. You know it probably won\u2019t go over well, but this is as good of time as any.\n\n\u201cOkay people as a great man who recently passed away once said, a carnival can be like a family. Now we\u2019ve just gotten over a major in house feud and an external threat and guess what, we\u2019re all still here and alive to talk about it. That means we can move on and grow stronger from this because I get the impression that we\u2019re REALLY going to need to have that unbreakable bond of family in the near future. A strong family also needs a strong leader and that\u2019s why seeing as I\u2019m currently the only one more or less in good physical condition at this time, I nominate myself as ringmaster.\u201d\n\nYou expect some verbal outbursts at this point, but everyone is still too exhausted or unwilling to get into more conflict, but you are getting a lot of frowning looks.\n\n\u201cNow I already know what you\u2019re thinking, this bitch hasn\u2019t been here but for a few days so who does she think she is telling us all what to do? Well let\u2019s answer that. You\u2019re right, I\u2019m new here, but I know A LOT about dysfunctional families. And every dysfunctional family ALSO needs a scapegoat to place the blame on. Now as ringmaster all the major decisions and such would fall to me and as such if I fuck up severely, well who gets the blame? Me of course. It\u2019s my hope of course that as a leader I can change everyone\u2019s perspective of me through successes. However, most of the females here already hate me based solely on how I look, and most of you guys just see me as a living sex doll, so really what have you got to lose? If it turns out that I\u2019m a total failure as a leader then you all can easily throw me out on my ass and choose someone else.\u201d\n\nNobody says anything. Just an awkward pause, which you decide to fill in with more talking.\n\n\u201cAnd if someone is worried that one group is going to get preferential treatment like say the clowns well you can stop worrying since most of them are currently dead and I\u2019m probably going to be too busy with being ring master than clowning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck it, let the cute clown slut run this place. Her mouth looks like it\u2019s a highway for oral sex, but she can\u2019t be any worse than what that mean ass cunt Razor had planned. At least she\u2019s got a positive attitude.\u201d Some dwarf woman says in the back holding a bloody rag over her forehead.\n\nAnd with that \u201csterling\u201d endorsement several others just agree as well.\n\nLooks like you\u2019re the new leader of this carnival and all it took was a complete bloodbath and the apathy of the survivors to do it.\n\nThe remainder of the night is spent building a small barricade around the big tent and clearing out the dead. Nobody knows if more of those geeks (Which is the new name for the \u201czombies\u201d and appropriate considering the history of what a carnival geek does for a living) are going to show up and where they came from so for safety reasons everyone stays close for the night. Some are in no condition to move anyway.\n\nEventually you fall asleep realizing that tomorrow is going to be a busy day for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201cHey fearless leader, wake up, your people demand it.\u201d Shrimpy says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nGroggily you sit up, you swear you feel like you\u2019ve barely gotten any sleep at all. Shrimpy stands nearby along with Klepto, the dwarf woman who \u201cendorsed\u201d you yesterday and a wiry scraggily looking man. You think he runs one of those carny games\u2026specifically the one where you shoot a water gun at a clown\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on is a bunch of shit, that\u2019s what darling. After the midgets here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck you Jack, we\u2019re DWARVES.\u201d The dwarf woman interrupts.\n\u201cWhatever Dolores. Anyway after the\u2026little people rounded up all the military supplies last night I got one of their radios tuned in to other military frequencies. Turns out that the nearby town has been overrun with those things we killed yesterday. The poor bastard that I spoke to just before it sounded like he got his guts ripped out said they don\u2019t know whether it was a virus or not., just that there were a shitload of them. Either way I say we got lucky that only a few wandered out this far. We need to get the fuck outta here.\u201d\n\u201cMy town\u2026wow\u2026uh\u2026\u201d you say being surprised by this revelation. You really are at a loss for words right now. You start to think about your real family and even Bobby. Are they okay? Are they already dead? Are they one of those things?\n\n\u201cSuzy? You okay? You\u2019re spacing out.\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cHuh, yeah, I\u2019m just\u2026okay yeah we obviously need to get out of here. Start packing up the rest of our stuff and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSweetheart didn\u2019t you hear what I said? I said there\u2019s probably fucking crazed cannibals on their way here right fucking now! We ain\u2019t got time for that shit! We need to just load up as much supplies we can and take off in our vehicles. This is the fucking end times man!\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to take that much longer to pack down, we had most of the stuff ready to go before the National Guard arrived. Some of our people are still wounded badly and need the rest as well. Besides, living in our trailers is going to be a lot more desirable than living in just a regular vehicle if there is a complete collapse of society going on right now.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cOkay then Tom Thumb YOU and the rest of the lollipop kids do it. Me and some of the others? We\u2019re taking supplies and leaving. Not stayin\u2019 around here waiting to be cannibal chow.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve been in charge for less than one full day and already someone is threatening to break away and worse, not even taking any notice of you. You just bludgeoned crazed freaks to death yesterday, you\u2019re tired of not being taken seriously.\n\n\u201cJack, if you or others want to leave you\u2019re free to do so, but what you\u2019re not doing is taking any of those military supplies from here. Those belong to the carnival and as such belong to all of us. Now if you don\u2019t want any part of that any longer, lots of luck, but you and anyone else that wants to leave you go with what personal items you came with.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, whatever. I didn\u2019t elect you as leader. I\u2019m only telling you as a courtesy, you can stay here and get eaten or come along and I can keep you safe. In fact to pass the time we can play shoot the clown in the mouth, except it won\u2019t be water going in your mouth, it\u2019ll be my\u2026\u201d\n\nJack isn\u2019t expecting you to kick him in the balls. The moment you do he winces and crumples. You follow up with a knee to his face. He\u2019s down and you have everyone\u2019s attention in the tent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last fucking blow job reference I\u2019m going to hear from you or ANYONE else for that matter. Now listen up, as I remember most of you were fine with me being in charge yesterday and goddamn it that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, be in fucking charge. This is STILL our carnival, that hasn\u2019t changed and I\u2019m not going to let it fall apart just because the rest of society seems to be. Now this is what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to finish packing up our shit, get our trailers and such in order, we\u2019re going to also take the military trucks and then we\u2019re going to move on. Now if some of those geeks show up well we\u2019ve got some brand new rifles and pistols to try them out on. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like this plan can leave with the shirts on their back and nothing else! Now let\u2019s stop fighting and get some of this damn shit done!\u201d\n\nAt this point those that are in condition to work, proceed to do so.\n\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Shrimpy asks pointing at Jack who is still on the ground.\n\u201cThrow his ass out, he made his decision.\u201d You remark and then notice Dolores smiling.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you smiling about?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cNothing, but I\u2019m beginning to like you, blondie.\u201d Dolores says and then whistles over several dwarves who promptly pick up Jack and haul him away. Dolores then leaves to go tend to other matters. Shrimpy says he\u2019s going to go help and leaves as well, leaving you alone with Klepto.\n\n\u201cWell, looks like you underwent quite a change while I was knocked out yesterday. I like it. Assertiveness is an attractive trait on you.\u201d\n\u201cKlepto, I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind and I\u2019m in no mood for your nice guy trying to get into my pants routine right now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, okay, sheesh, I\u2019m just\u2026nevermind\u2026fuck I\u2019ll just leave you alone ringmaster.\u201d Klepto says and walks off.\n\nYou can\u2019t worry about Klepto\u2019s fragile ego right now, you\u2019ve got bigger concerns and that\u2019s on top of still thinking about your \u201cold\u201d family. You know you made the decision to leave them all, but that was still just a few days ago and you still never wanted any of them to suffer at the hands of whatever the hell those things are.\n\nSpeaking of which you still have to worry about those geeks. Jack might\u2019ve been out of line, but he still might\u2019ve been correct about some wandering towards the carnival like those yesterday did. Considering the dwarves still seem to be the largest faction and friendliest toward you, you have some of them armed with the rifles to stand on top of the trailers and keep a look out. You keep yourself busy by helping with the clean up.\n\nHours pass and that\u2019s when your lookouts see something approaching. Not the geeks, but rather a few pick up trucks which look like they\u2019re holding several men carrying shotguns and rifles. You call everyone to immediately take a defensive position and to fall back.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what to expect, but a bunch of heavily armed men can\u2019t ever be a good thing. Unfortunately as leader, you\u2019re going to have to be the one to handle this visit, hopefully peacefully if you can.\n\nAs the pick up trucks stop, you stand several feet away with your \u201csnipers\u201d keep a bead on your visitors. You hang on to your own rifle and several other carnies do likewise. One of the men gets out one of the trucks with his hands up. Looks like a redneck, in fact you imagine this lot are from the trailer park a few miles down the road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay li\u2019l lady, I see yer guys up there. Ain\u2019t nobody lookin\u2019 for a fight.\u201d He says.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way, given that you\u2019ve come with three trucks full of armed men and don\u2019t tell me its hunting season.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, well I\u2019m sure given your own heightened state of awareness, you know things are getting\u2019 dangerous nowadays. Anyway my name\u2019s Mel, I\u2019m guessin\u2019 since you\u2019re the one talkin\u2019 you\u2019re in charge here. Ringmaster or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cSomething exactly like that.\u201d you say.\n\u201cOkay. You\u2026uh\u2026got some military gear here too I see. That truck over there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what of it?\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing, but that brings about the question of where are the guardsmen\u2026heh yeah they tried to tell us what to do too. Didn\u2019t work out so well. The second amendment says you got the right to pack it after all. Government can\u2019t just do what they want.\u201d\n\nAt this point more of Mel\u2019s men get out of their trucks as well. Your people and Mel\u2019s people are both starting to eye each other waiting for someone to fire a shot.\n\n\u201cLook let me cut to the chase honey. I\u2019m assumin\u2019 you might know by now what\u2019s been happenin\u2019 back in town. Besides the government tryin\u2019 to pull their shit, there\u2019s a bunch of freaks runnin\u2019 around tryin\u2019 to eat people. A bunch of them attacked us last night and while we fought them off, some of us got badly hurt and are in need of medical supplies. Now of course we did try goin\u2019 into town first, but was just too fucked up there an\u2019 we didn\u2019t make much head way what with the freaks AND the guard all over the damn place. Then it occurred to me today that your circus might still be around and the National Guard probably would\u2019ve been here as well so we decided to investigate. Now the group of weekend warriors at the trailer park had shit for medical supplies. So I\u2019m hoping your detachment had more in that department.\u201d\n\nMel looks up at your dwarves upon the trailers.\n\n\u201cNow you might get a few of us, but I\u2019m bettin, most of us are better shots than y\u2019all, so if you give us what medicine supplies you do have we\u2019ll leave here in peace, if not well\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point things could get very violent very quickly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Open fire", "result": "You let these assholes come in and take medical supplies and they won\u2019t stop there. After all you\u2019ve been through you\u2019re not putting up with MORE people not taking you seriously.\n\n\u201cFIRE!\u201d you shout and run back for cover as your people do just that. Naturally the trailer park crew do the same as their own leader runs for cover too.\n\nYou\u2019ve never shot at a human before, but you do remember when your brother Ben tried to show you how to shoot once. You weren\u2019t very good at it then, and you\u2019re not very good at it now, and sadly neither are a lot of your people.\n\nSeveral carnies get killed in the ensuing gun battle and many more get hit. While your own side does score a few hits of its own, Mel wasn\u2019t bluffing when he said his people were better shots. It\u2019s actually amazing that you come through unscathed, though that might be because Klepto in his foolish attempt to play hero gets fatality shot when trying to shield you.\n\nThe only thing that prevents the rednecks from completely overrunning you is one of the jugglers lobs one of the few grenades that were acquired from the military with fairly good accuracy, blowing up two of their trucks (and some of them) and giving the survivors enough pause to understand that a continued attack is not in their best interest.\n\nMel and the rest quickly pile into the surviving truck and drive away. You\u2019ve won, but at a high cost. The carnies have already suffered losses and wounded with the recent internal struggle. Those that aren\u2019t wounded or dead are now experiencing a mixture of sorrow, rage and loss of hope.\n\n\u201cWell what now fearless leader?! We got even more dead and wounded thanks to your leadership!\u201d Dolores exclaims.\n\u201cWould it have been better if I just let them come in a take all our shit?!\u201d you snap.\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better had we not got all our asses shot off! If it hadn\u2019t been for Zackary throwing a grenade we\u2019d probably all be worm food!\u201d\n\u201cAnd how the hell is that my fault?! I was shooting at those hillbillies right along the rest of you! I didn\u2019t see YOU hitting any of them!\u201d\n\nWhile you and Dolores continue to argue Shrimpy steps in to try to mediate.\n\n\u201cHey we don\u2019t have time for all this infighting! Haven\u2019t we had enough of that shit? Now we survived and that\u2019s the most important thing. I say we continue with our original plan and get the fuck outta here, in fact I think we should just pack up and go RIGHT NOW. Those rednecks aren\u2019t going to just take this loss, they\u2019re going to come back in force.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? You want us to just turn tail and run after this? We need to get revenge!\u201d\n\u201cDolores, we already got several wounded people who are in no condition to fight! Never mind the amount of dead! We have no idea how many of those gun toting rednecks there are or even how much weaponry they have!\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cMost likely a lot and that\u2019s not even counting whatever they got from the military.\u201d You add.\n\nDolores isn\u2019t deterred however, she\u2019s just angrier specifically at you.\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026(Sigh) can\u2019t believe I supported you as a leader, must\u2019ve been the goddamn blood loss from my head wound after the carnival fight. Look, now maybe this gunfight was a cluster fuck and that\u2019s why I\u2019m pissed, but I suppose in the scheme of things you at least stood up to these bastards. If we hit them now, they probably won\u2019t even expect it, and you heard their leader, he said they had a lot of wounded of their own, so how many of them could there really be?\u201d\n\nDolores exhales and now gives you an even more glaring look, which you didn\u2019t think was possible.\n\n\u201cHowever, your plan is to just run off and not avenge our fallen then maybe you need to get the fuck outta the way and hit the road like you told us to do with Jack not too long ago. Suzy, if YOU want to continue running this carnival YOU better do the right thing. \u201d\n\nDolores\u2019 intentions are obvious and clear. She\u2019s going to go take revenge no matter what. What isn\u2019t quite obvious is if she\u2019s going to have the support. There are probably some that will support her, but several more are likely to not want to do any more fighting.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave now", "result": "\u201cDolores, you\u2019re not going to intimidate me any more than those stupid rednecks, if you want to go get your head blown off in a futile task then be my guest, but the rest of us are leaving\u2026\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Dolores points her weapon at you. This action causes the few that are still in fighting condition to raise their own weapons as well. Some of them at Dolores and some at you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so blondie. I\u2019m running this show now.\u201d\n\u201cDolores have you lost your mind?!\u201d Shrimpy exclaims.\n\u201cShrimpy, you better pick a fucking side, because your days of riding the fucking fence are soon coming to an end, now you either support the carnival or you can get the fuck out too!\u201d Dolores says.\n\nWhile having a rifle pointed straight at you, would\u2019ve been terrifying at one time for you, it\u2019s not anymore.\n\n\u201cDolores, if you think this is going to make me back down, you\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you think that I won\u2019t shoot you, you\u2019re sorely stupid.\u201d\n\u201cDolores look around you, I don\u2019t see a united front against me. All you\u2019re doing is going to cripple your own cause by opening fire and that\u2019s assuming you even survive this. If you really want to get revenge on those rednecks then you\u2019re going to need everyone you can get. And THIS is not the way to do it.\u201d\n\nDolores might be angry, but she\u2019s not stupid and knows you\u2019ve got a point.\n\n\u201cAll right then, you got a suggestion blondie? And don\u2019t say just to follow you, because that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can see that. (Sigh) I can see that this carnival is doomed to tear itself apart so the way I see it, anyone who wants to come with me, leaves right now. This means we\u2019re going to leave with most of our personal possessions and some supplies, half of that stuff is still ours, but we\u2019ll just take what we need. We\u2019re also going to be travelling lighter, so we\u2019re just going to take some of the smaller vehicles. You can have all the trailers and the bigger trucks. Since I imagine most of the wounded won\u2019t be in any condition to travel so you\u2019ll need those if only to give them comfortable transport when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about weapons?\u201d Dolores asks.\n\u201cWell everyone keeps their personal ones along with some ammo and YOU make due with whatever is left. Hopefully for you, most people that are armed stay with you. As a gesture of good will though, you can keep the few grenades we have. While I get the impression they would come in useful, I also think if you have any chance of beating those rednecks, you\u2019re going to need them more than we will.\u201d\n\nAt this point you hold out your hand to solidify the deal, which Dolores gives you a sideways glance before returning the gesture.\n\n\u201cFine, but I better not catch any of you cowards taking more than you need!\u201d Afterwards she starts calling everyone and anyone who\u2019ll listen of why they should stay with her and take revenge on the trailer park.\n\nYou on the other hand aren\u2019t going to try to convince any more people, you\u2019re done with speeches for a while, as far as you\u2019re concerned it\u2019s been a bit of a waste of time. If they want to come, then good, if not, then oh well.\n\nOn your way back to your trailer to pick up your personal belonging, you notice that it must\u2019ve caught a few stray bullets during the gunfire. When you open up the door, you\u2019re met with an even bigger surprise.\n\nOn the floor you see Ranko with several bullet holes in him and bleeding out. Nearby is a straight razor close to his hand. He sees you and struggles to speak.\n\n\u201cSuz\u2026zy\u2026you gotta (cough) help\u2026me\u2026\u201d he says.\n\u201cOh this is rich, you want ME to help you? What the hell were you doing in my trailer in the first place? Going to attack me? Maybe rape me perhaps?\u201d you say picking up the straight razor.\n\u201cI\u2026was\u2026goi\u2026pologize\u2026(gasp) (gurgle)\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, excuse me if I don\u2019t believe you. You deserve to die and with the day I\u2019ve had, I think I\u2019ll take the opportunity to enjoy watching it.\u201d\n\u201c(gurgle) Fuck\u2026you\u2026(gasp)\u2026\u201d Ranko utters.\n\nThose words are his last as he slowly finishes bleeding to death. Well he certainly left a mess, but considering this isn\u2019t going to be your trailer anymore at least you don\u2019t need to worry about cleaning up.\n\nAs you\u2019re packing up, someone enters the trailer, you\u2019re a little paranoid, so you immediately draw your weapon only to see Shrimpy.\n\n\u201cWhoa! It\u2019s just me! I was just wondering which\u2026holy shit, is that Ranko?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the asshole apparently was hiding in here waiting to ambush me. Caught some stray bullets as you can see. Couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy. So what did you want?\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh well, I was just coming to ask which vehicle did you want? I mean considering Lifto and Klepto are both dead, I figure we got more right to those two before anyone else might at least.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re coming with me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I was against attacking the trailer park remember? In fact there are several people ready to leave. Dunno how Dolores\u2019 raid on the trailer park is going to go, but that\u2019s hardly our problem right?\u201d\n\nYou pause a bit before addressing Shrimpy\u2019s rhetorical question.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m doing the right thing, abandoning the carnival like this? I mean Dolores had a point when she said I just threw out Jack without supplies because he wanted to leave. I feel like sort of a hypocrite.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell\u2026I think you\u2019re doing the best with the cards that were dealt and that\u2019s all you can do sometimes. I mean there are people here that have been with the carnival longer and they\u2019re ready to leave without hesitation, so you certainly shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it. I mean with the way the world is going nowadays, does something like a carnival even have a future anymore?\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cMaybe not, we probably should stick to rural areas for at least a few days until some of this shit dies down, but I\u2019m just wondering what we\u2019re going to do with ourselves for the future in general.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure something out. But just know that I\u2019ll stand by your decision whatever it is.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Shrimpy\u2026hey what is your real name anyway?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, oh that. Well haven\u2019t been called it in year, but its Lance.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know I look far from being a Lance though. You probably picture a big tall heroic guy with a square jaw or something.\u201d\n\u201cEh, those guys don\u2019t exist in real life anyway, well at least they\u2019ve never existed in my life, but you\u2019ve been all right.\u201d\n\nLance smiles and waits for you to finish packing and the pair of you head to Lifto\u2019s vehicle, which to your surprise has been fitted to accommodate a \u201cshorter\u201d driver.\n\nYou, Lance and several others leave the carnival which is now in the process of gearing up for the raid on the trailer park (or housing the very wounded) you can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s going to go, but you hope Dolores is successful even if you didn\u2019t see eye to eye with her.\n\nLance and you drive along with several other vehicles in an odd caravan like fashion. Really there is no reason why everyone needs to stay together, since everyone is free to go their own separate way, but perhaps leaving the carnival is too much of a change and at least there is a little bit of a familiarity by sticking with the same people.\n\nYou and Lance converse the entire time you drive, though eventually at one point you start to get sleepy and Lance takes over with the driving.

Still, you can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though.

Listen up! This might be the end of civilization as we know it, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world! Sure life is going to be harder now, but when hasn\u2019t it been for us carnies? Why just this damn week we suffered through a military occupation, an internal civil war, an attack by freaks, and an attack by a bunch of rednecks. We\u2019ve already splintered apart enough already. No way are we going to descend any further.

We\u2019ll still be drifters because that\u2019s how we\u2019ll survive. This world just got a whole lot shittier and we ARE nomads and vagabonds by nature. Surely we\u2019ll be picking up, collecting, and scavenging useful material, items and the like to trade in our travels.

We can survive this.\u201d someone says and several others agree.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t get a feeling of enthusiasm, at least this time you are not met with apathy.\n\nIn any case, you and some of the others get together to decide where to head next and what to do about food, and fuel.

After years of previously being drifters, we let ourselves get unprepared.

Still, you do wonder if you\u2019re probably a little overprotective of your daughter, you won\u2019t be around forever and she should have the opportunity to live her own life and if that means she wants to live in a permanent residence then perhaps she should be given that chance.\n\n\u201cLucy, the world is still pretty fucked up now, but despite my previous cynicism, I suppose parts of it are getting better. Maybe one day you can find a nice place to settle down that won\u2019t be run by a bloodthirsty warlord or in danger of being raided by mutant cannibals. And if that\u2019s your choice, then you\u2019re free to do it. I know you\u2019ll have to live your own life eventually.\u201d You say.\n\nLucy smiles at the permission, but reassures you that she had no intention of leaving you yet. It\u2019s comforting, since it shows that she still wants you around. She\u2019s still your child.\n\nYou, Lucy and the rest of your ragtag band of traders, tinkerers and scavengers make your way to the town of Blivop. Not exactly the best for trade, but at least the people there aren\u2019t complete amoral rapists and murderers.\n\nLater that night when your caravan sets down for the night, you drift off to sleep with an old worn clown nose in your hand. You squeeze it a couple times, remembering happy times with your now departed husband.\n\n\u201cGoddnight Lance.\u201d You say and slowly drift off with the round red foam ball in your hand.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Get revenge", "result": "If you\u2019re going to have any hope and future of keeping this carnival together with you as leader, you\u2019re going to have to get revenge on those rednecks.

Just gotta get organized first\u2026\u201d you say before Shrimpy interrupts.\n\u201cSuzy are you serious? Haven\u2019t you noticed all of the wounded and dead we have?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re going to hit those bastards back hard! Look Shrimpy, if this is the way the world is going to work now, we need to always stand up to bullies or else they\u2019ll just walk all over you. Trust me, I know what the hell I\u2019m talking about. Now you can either get with the program or hit the road.\u201d You say.\n\nShrimpy is taken aback by your harsh tone. He doesn\u2019t reply, he just nods and leaves. He doesn\u2019t leave, so he\u2019s willing to fall in line despite believing that this is a bad idea.\n\nDolores and yourself both gather those still in fighting condition and convince them that an attack is in order. You manage to convince most, but there are a few that leave. Dolores is nearly ready to blow their heads off for wanting to take some supplies with them, but not wishing to cause another potential internal firefight you allow them to leave with minimal of supplies.\n\nWithin an hour and a half everyone that is willing to come with you is loaded up and ready to go. Shrimpy, in perhaps an effort to show his dedication says he\u2019ll come too, but you tell him to stay behind with the wounded just so there is someone that can help them in case they have to be moved immediately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly how much I\u2019m going to be able to help in that regard. My name isn\u2019t Lifto.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cWell, not all of them are down for the count. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be able to help a few at least.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy, you don\u2019t need to do this, we could just leave. This attack is a suicide mission. It\u2019s obvious from the last firefight with those good ol\u2019 boys we can\u2019t hit for shit.\u201d\n\u201cWell, fortunately we\u2019ve got some automatic weapons in that regard, more bullets, more likely to hit the targets. Hey it happens.\u201d You say.\n\nSensing he isn\u2019t going to talk you out of this, Shrimpy wishes you good luck and you\u2019re on your way to a path of rip roarin\u2019 revenge, though there is a part of you that would just like to run.\n\nYou lead the drive to the trailer park since you actually know where it is exactly. When you arrive, it\u2019s hard to tell if the place is in shambles from when their leader said they were attacked or if it always looked this way.\n\nNo sooner have all your vehicles stopped, when Dolores has already gotten out of the military truck you took and started lobbing the remaining grenades at the trailer homes.\n\n\u201cCome on out you inbred sister fuckers!\u201d she shouts and begins firing randomly at the rest of the homes.\n\n\u201cDolores, get back in the\u2026\u201d you begin to say and then suddenly Dolores actions have attracted return fire.\n\n\u201cOver there! Fire over there!\u201d Dolores shouts and takes cover.\n\nAt this point Dolores is giving out orders and you\u2019re not being listened to at all. Despite Dolores\u2019 enthusiasm for revenge it doesn\u2019t suddenly make her a better \u201ccommander.\u201d You at least try to remember all those times you played video games on your computer and know that wading straight forward into battle is traditionally a shit strategy so you attempt to try the classic pincer maneuver.\n\nUnfortunately given that you\u2019re the only one using any sort of critical thinking and nobody is actually listening to you, you\u2019re mainly stuck by yourself, trying to pick off the hillbillies when you see them pop up. If you were actually a good shot, you might\u2019ve actually turned this attack into a successful one.\n\nAs it stands, the trailer park crew even with the wounded they have and catching them off guard with the grenades, still outnumber you severely and STILL have better shots. They also have explosives of their own perhaps not military grade like you had, but when you\u2019ve got a lot of half empty liquor bottles lying around and people with too much time on their hands well sometimes even the lower born get creative.\n\nYour vehicles and your people are suddenly bombarded by several Molotov cocktails and someone even has a homemade \u201clauncher.\u201d The explosions are big, loud and fatal to most of your people who were still taking cover behind them. The others who weren\u2019t have already gotten cut down by the gunfire. Dolores herself is lying dead with a bullet hole in her head and you\u2019re suddenly hearing hillbillies whoopin\u2019 it up and seriously worried about your physical safety.\n\n\u201cWhoo hoo! Somebody keep the pretty blonde one alive! We can have a good time wit her!\u201d you hear one of them shout.\n\u201cGoddamnit Ray, stop thinkin\u2019 with yer dick for one minute, she\u2019s still armed ya dumb shit!\u201d you hear Mel shout back.\n\nSeeing as none of the vehicles you came in are usable anymore you attempt to run. You just hope you\u2019ve got more endurance than a bunch of overweight beer swillin\u2019 hicks. They aren\u2019t going to be able to follow immediately by any working vehicles they might have due to the flaming scrap heap blocking the trailer park entrance created by their homemade bombs.\n\nYou MIGHT have made it, if they weren\u2019t lead by a more pragmatic leader type. Just goes to show that you can\u2019t judge people just by where they come from\u2026\n\nAs soon as you make it to the road, a single shot rings out and you feel a burning sensation run through your upper back and up your spine. You then feel numb and collapse instantly. You\u2019re paralyzed, not just from the waist down, but from the neck down. You panic and the tears start when you know this is it.\n\nMel arrives before the rest of his crew who are now complaining loudly about Mel shooting you.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Well darlin\u2019 you asked fer this. I get why you attacked, but that doesn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 mean we\u2019re gonna sit and take it in the ass any more than you did. Just be glad, I\u2019m puttin\u2019 you outa yer misery rather than lettin\u2019 the rest have their way with you.\u201d Mel says.\n\nYou don\u2019t reply and just close your eyes waiting to hear the final shot.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Continue to negotiate", "result": "Being a \u201cnative\u201d of the area, you do know something of the types that do live in the trailer park.

You start a shooting match here and you\u2019re likely to wind up with more dead and wounded than what was worth the effort.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t believe you darlin\u2019.\u201d Mel replies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, seriously come on in and take a look yourself. We got a shitload of wounded ourselves in that big tent back there. Just you though, the rest of your people can stand out here and look fearsome.\u201d\n\nMel chuckles.\n\n\u201cOh just me huh? And as soon as I go in I\u2019m at your fuckin\u2019 mercy. Nah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cFine so take me as hostage. Here\u2026\u201d you say and drop your rifle and walk over to Mel. A couple people shout at you, but you just wave a hand at them as if to tell them to calm down. Meanwhile Mel stands watching you approach. When you\u2019re before him, he\u2019s definitely staring you up and down.\n\n\u201cYou got a pistol I presume?\u201d you ask Mel.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell pull it out and put it to my head.\u201d You say turning around and putting your body against Mel\u2019s and then putting one of his arms around your waist.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 shit girl, you\u2019re just somethin\u2019 else ain\u2019t cha?\u201d Mel says barely keeping his composure as he pulls out his pistol.\n\u201cIf you say so. In any case you now have a little insurance that should be good enough for you shouldn\u2019t it? I mean\u2026I\u2019m putting my complete trust in you. You\u2019re in complete control\u201d you say and grind up against Mel\u2019s body a little more while turning your head a bit to flutter your eyes at him.\n\nMel is at a loss for words, but his buddies aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWoo Hoo, looks like the li\u2019l blonde number is sweet on ya Mel!\u201d\n\u201cI say we take her back, instead of medical supplies. I never liked Bobby Ray to begin with. Motherfucker can bleed out fer all I care!\u201d\n\u201cYou plannin\u2019 on tradin\u2019 Tina up fer her?\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Mel get all the pretty ones? He\u2019s already got Tina, I say one of us should get the blonde!\u201d\n\nAt this point some arguing breaks out, followed by Mel shouting at them to shut the fuck up. He then turns his attention back to you.\n\n\u201cHeh\u2026 you \u2026you are trouble girlie. If I took you back to the trailer park, you\u2019d probably have every man ripping each other apart over you. I can barely keep these dumb fuckers from doing that now. In any case, let\u2019s go look at the medical supply situation. Come on.\u201d Mel says motioning you to move.\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d You say.\n\nMel and you head back towards the carnival where upon you give him the \u201cgrand tour\u201d showing him that it is indeed true that you don\u2019t really have much in the way of medical supplies. He also sees all the people that are wounded too.\n\n\u201cHmm, well I suppose y\u2019all COULD still be hidin\u2019 such things somewhere, but honestly I\u2019m inclined to believe ya. This place has even less military vehicles than the ones that were at the trailer park and it sounds like from what you told me there weren\u2019t even that many guardsmen here. From the amount of wounded I see, you probably did use up most of the pittance that the military brought with them\u2026how did you get all these wounded though? Nobody looks like they\u2019re suffering from gunshot wounds. The cannibal creeps?\u201d\n\u201cNope. All these wounded are from each other. Long story, let\u2019s just say carny politics is complicated and I came out on top.\u201d You reply confidently.\n\u201cI see\u2026well you have certainly displayed a certain amount of balls putting yourself in the vulnerable position you did. (Sigh) All right, you dealt straight with me, so I\u2019ll deal straight with you. Guess we\u2019ll try the town again.\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Mel head back to the \u201cneutral zone\u201d where upon Mel releases you (reluctantly) and waves at his people to get ready to go.\n\nAs they drive away, you breathe a heavy sigh of relief and rush back to the others. Dolores approaches you when you arrive.\n\n\u201cWell that was an interesting way to handle things, but it worked. Those good ol\u2019 boys woulda probably killed and wounded a lot more of us.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, an\u2019 now we need to get the hell out of here. I don\u2019t trust them to not come back with a bigger group and attack us anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we probably could\u2019ve done with a bit more of a rest, but I can\u2019t argue with that logic, they weren\u2019t the most reputable lookin\u2019 an\u2019 you\u2019re the boss. One good thing about having some recently departed, is that the trailers have a lot more room in them now. Speaking of which, your own trailer is already hooked up to a truck. We should be ready to roll in about an hour.\u201d\n\nFeeling like you deserve a rest after recent events, you head back to your trailer to relax.\n\nAs soon as you enter though, you are suddenly grabbed and tackled to the floor and the stench of bad body odor fills your nostrils.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t scream bitch.\u201d A familiar voice whispers. You get a good look at your assailant and see a man with half worn clown make up on his face.\n\nIt\u2019s Ranko and he smells even worse now that he\u2019s laying right on top of you.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of fuckin\u2019 changes to this here carnival have happened since I\u2019ve been gone. Saw some of it from afar while hiding and waiting for the best time to strike. Nearly got eaten by those geeks in the process, but heh heh heh, I got away\u2026\u201d\n\nRanko begins to press his weight on you so you can\u2019t wiggle away while keeping one hand on your mouth and holding a straight razor in his other. His whole outfit is filthy presumably from lurking about in the wilderness for days, but you also notice that he\u2019s sporting a couple wounds of his own in the form of bite marks.\n\n\u201cNothing smart to say now bitch? Thought you were the ringmaster now. Head cunt in charge and all that. Fuck you, I SHOULD be in fuckin\u2019 charge!\u201d\n\nAt this point you manage to bite Ranko\u2019s hand, which tastes foul, but it\u2019s enough to cause him to take it off your mouth, giving you a chance to scream for help, before he backhands you across the face.\n\n\u201cBitch! Maybe if I raped you, you\u2019d KNOW who\u2019s in fuckin\u2019 charge!\u201d he exclaims and fumbles with pulling down his pants, and keeps the straight razor to your throat with his other hand. (Carnies must love straight razors)\n\nAll Ranko has to do is make a quick swipe and your throat is going to be opened if you struggle. If you do nothing he may very well rape you assuming nobody heard you scream.

The thought sickens you, but you realize there might still be a way to avoid your current horrible situation without resisting.\n\n\u201cYou gonna treat me like a whore? Come on then do it!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ranko asks.\n\u201cCome on, stick it in me daddy.

Daddy used to come into my room late at night and get rough sometimes, but I knew he only did it because he loved me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026are one twisted\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Ranko can finish his sentence you muster up the courage and put aside the revulsion long enough to move your head forward to kiss Ranko\u2019s lips and even shove your tongue in his mouth.\n\nIt\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever tasted, and it\u2019s only due to your strong gag reflex (Yes, if most people knew that about you they\u2019d have a field day with the jokes due to that knowledge) that you don\u2019t puke.\n\nRanko\u2019s blade has cut your neck superficially due to moving your head forward, but your action has had the desired effect of him relaxing a bit. Not enough that you\u2019d trust being able to escape or successfully get the straight razor away, but it bought you some time.\n\n\u201cHah, I KNEW you were into me! No bitch can resist a man who takes charge! You want me to do you like daddy did huh? Well did he ever do this?\u201d Ranko says and then flips you over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna ride your ASS so hard, you\u2019re not gonna shit right for a long time!\u201d he says and starts pulling your pants down.\n\u201cOh no! I\u2019m a virgin back there!\u201d you say in the most innocent way possible, which of course makes Ranko only laugh like the rapist creep he is and rips your panties off.\n\nMeanwhile the blood must\u2019ve completely left his brain and gone all to his dick, because the idiot dropped his straight razor in his desire to fuck you in the ass. You grab the straight razor, which is now near your hand.\n\nBefore Ranko can get his dick into the \u201cpromised land\u201d you turn your head and swipe backwards with the razor. He\u2019s close enough that you catch him across the face.\n\n\u201cAGH! GODDAMNIT! FUCKING BITCH!\u201d he shouts and falls backwards holding the side of his face. You scramble forward and grab a couple of nearby items before turning around to throw them at him.\n\nHe blocks and screams a bunch of obscenities, but before he can advance towards you, someone has at last heard the commotion going on.\n\n\u201cMotherfucker\u2026\u201d Shrimpy says opening up the door and rushes to punch Ranko in the small of the back. Ranko back kicks Shrimpy causing the little guy to fall. Sensing he\u2019s no longer in control of the situation, Ranko tries to escape out the door, only to trip and fall awkwardly on his face due to his pants and underwear still being around his ankles.\n\nYou aren\u2019t about to let Ranko get away with shit, so you plunge the razor into Ranko\u2019s ass and twist. His screams are predictable.\n\n\u201cWas it good for you?\u201d you say and then slam his face into the door twice, breaking his nose and causing him to gurgle a bit on his own blood. And for the finisher, you pull the bloody, shitty razor out of his ass and slit his throat with it.\n\nYou then fall back and sit on a nearby chair breathing heavily after your ordeal. Shrimpy at this point recovers as well.\n\n\u201cShit, I know this is a silly question, but are you all right?\u201d he asks.\n\u201c (Pant) Well, I\u2019m alright in that at least this fucktard didn\u2019t ass rape me, but this wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience (pant).

Why don\u2019t you help pull this asshole out of the trailer?\u201d Shrimpy says and gets Ranko\u2019s body by the feet while presumably Dolores and Klepto pull the rest of him out of the trailer.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to his ass? It\u2019s all bloody\u2026ugh, this guy smells worse than when he was alive.\u201d You hear Dolores say, as the door slams shut.\n\nYou grab something to cover your naked lower half with while Shrimpy continues to stand in the doorway, just in case Klepto wants to play \u201cwhite knight\u201d and come see you.\n\n\u201cThanks Shrimpy.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFor what, I barely did anything.\u201d He replies.\n\u201cIt was enough that you got here when you did.\u201d\n\u201cWell I was initially on my way to ask where are next destination was going to be, but I guess that can wait for now.

You\u2019re also glad you\u2019ve got a \u201cfamily\u201d of sorts now, there is some comfort in that.\n\nThe rest of your day is spent staying alone in your trailer though given that the whole carnival is soon on the move it isn\u2019t like anyone is going to just walk up and knock on your door now.\n\nThe motion of the trailer combined with the stress of the day causes you to collapse on your bed and close your eyes as you eventually fall asleep\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nA loud noise in the distance wakes you up and you also notice you\u2019re no longer moving.\n\nA quick look out one of the window and you see something that is going to change your life more than anything else in the world.\n\nA mushroom cloud.\n\nYou\u2019re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn\u2019t engulfed you, so you\u2019re guessing that it wasn\u2019t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one.

You half expect them to all shout \u201cOne of us.\u201d Over and over, but perhaps that might be a bit too obvious.\n\nIn any case, you and some of the others get together to decide where to head next and what to do about food, and fuel. This isn\u2019t going to be easy, but then this whole week has been a trial for you.\n\nNo longer are you the shy \u201cgood\u201d girl who hid away in the basement, harassed by your family and living as one day blurred into the next. You are part of something bigger and not just that, but a leader.\n\nIt\u2019s a brand new day and this is just the beginning of your brand new life.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Greatest Show On Scorched Earth\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\nAfter yet another successful show, the performers of the Cataclysm Carnival begin to pack down for the night and engage in their usual banter.\n\n\u201cWell that was certainly fun. It\u2019s been a long time since we got to actually perform an entire show like that.\u201d Sparkle remarks while putting away her chainsaws.\n\u201cHa ha ha ha, yeah I wouldn\u2019t exacty call General Hellstorm\u2019s totalitarian city state civilization, but it was a nice change from the usual shanty towns or worse, those Ground Zero owned shelter communities. God, I sometimes wonder what the fuck happened in some of those places after the bombs hit. I swear most of those folks are more fucked up than the people who got caught on the surface.\u201d Randy adds.\n\nHector and Lucy step inside the trailer.\n\n\u201cI imagine being stuck in close quarters with a bunch of people for long periods of time is bound to make a lot of people weird. I mean you don\u2019t have to look too far to see that.\u201d Bruno says after hearing part of the conversation.\n\u201cI hope you remembered to lock up those cat-rat things, this time. Last time they got out and chewed several holes in one of the trailers.\u201d Sparkle says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re called Nibblers and yes, I made sure they\u2019re all locked up. I threw in some meat too so they should be good.\u201d Hector remarks.\n\u201cHrm, I still dunno how you can work with those things. I saw a wild one take off an arm in one bite before.\u201d Randy says.\n\u201cJust gotta show the little bitey bastards whose boss.\u201d Hector says proudly displaying how he still has all ten of his fingers.\n\nLucy says nothing and just walks to the nearest mirror to take her clown make up off. Randy and Sparkle sense something amiss.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Sparkle asks.\n\u201cShes\u2019s pissed because apparently General Hellstorm was flirting a lot with her hot mom at the end of the night. In fact I\u2019d wager that\u2019s how we landed this job in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cHector, I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t call my mom hot. I told you that before. And I\u2019d REALLY appreciate it if you didn\u2019t imply my mother was a whore!\u201d Lucy says.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake Lucy, I didn\u2019t say she was! I just meant ol\u2019 Hellstorm probably went all soppy when he first saw your mother. She turned on the charm and just reeled in the rube. Shit, we ALL should have such talent when we get to be that age. IF we get to be that age in this shitty world.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver the flatterer I see, Hector. Glad to know that a woman in their forties still has a place in this rotten world.\u201d You say stepping into the trailer.\n\nHector isn\u2019t quite sure how to react.\n\n\u201cUm, apologies Ringmistress Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cRelax, you don\u2019t ever have to worry about not being charming Hector, you\u2019ll always have your Nibblers to keep you warm. Your father Klepto would\u2019ve been so proud.\u201d You say patting Hector on the head in a condescending manner.\n\nSparkle and Randy both greet you, but your daughter continues to focus on the mirror.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m just making the rounds to everyone and I just wanted to say it was a good show tonight and I\u2019m proud of all of you. In fact we might be coming here to perform again in a few more months. Mr. Hellstorm really enjoyed the show. You\u2019d think a guy that goes by the name General Hellstorm would be all WAR DEATH RAGH! But the guy actually is pretty even tempered, well as far as wasteland warlords go anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHey which act did he like the most? Did he like my chainsaw bit?\u201d Sparkle asks enthusiastically.\n\u201cHeh, well to be honest he wouldn\u2019t stop going on about the freakshow portion. The guy really liked that bit. If there\u2019s one good thing about living in a radiated post apocalyptic landscape, it has got this carnival\u2019s freakshow up and running again. On the pragmatic side of things we also exchanged some of those weird laser weapons we found. We\u2019d never use the damn things, but Hellstorm seemed to really like the idea of them and thought he could get them working so we\u2019ve got food and medical supplies for months. I think Dolores is making a count now\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re explaining the upbeat news, you notice that your daughter is still looking into the mirror and scowling the entire time as she finishes taking off her make up.\n\n\u201cCould the rest of you leave for a moment, I have to speak to Lucy.\u201d You say. Nobody argues and one by one they exit the trailer leaving you alone with Lucy.\n\n\u201cAll right, what are you pissed about this time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing. Don\u2019t you have some guy to go lick your lips at?\u201d Lucy replies.\n\u201cNot at the moment no, but I\u2019m glad you continue to have such a high opinion of me.\u201d\n\u201cFlirting with power mad warlords, great reason to have a high opinion\u2026\u201d Lucy at this point turns to you with anger in her face.\n\u201cGoddamn it, Dad hasn\u2019t been dead a month and you\u2019re already fawning all over some other man! It was bad enough that you did it when he was alive, but can\u2019t you even respect the dead?!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this MANY times Lucy. I loved your father and I never once was unfaithful to him, but your father would\u2019ve actually understood better than anyone. Show must go on Lucy. Besides I\u2019m not actually doing anything with Hellstorm, except a tease and most likely giving him something to dream about. I\u2019ve always done that to the rubes to get their attention, it\u2019s part of being a ringmaster. Even that idiot Hector gets that, don\u2019t know why you never did.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s fucking embarrassing to constantly hear the sexual innuendo about your mother from passing rubes about how they\u2019d like to master YOUR ring.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, hadn\u2019t heard that one before, sort of an obvious pun when you think about it though\u2026\u201d you remark.\n\u201cStop being so fucking calm about this! I mean\u2026sorry\u2026I just\u2026I mean I KNOW it\u2019s all an act, but I just wish you\u2019d tone it down sometimes.\u201d Lucy says.\n\u201cBelieve me, I do. You\u2019ve never seen me in full-blown seductress mode. Look, I\u2019m a big girl and not doing anything that I\u2019m forced to do. (sigh) I know you\u2019re a worldly girl and all, but there\u2019s still a small part of you that\u2019s a bit na\u00efve. Must be a genetic trait passed down from me.\u201d\n\u201cNa\u00efve?\u201d\n\u201cYes my wonderfully oblivious darling daughter. You seriously believe that nobody is making comments about you? You walk around in a pink and purple skintight outfit with fishnets stockings blowing luminescent bubbles during your act. How do you know that all those lewd remarks are about me? Half of them are probably about you, but you\u2019re so concerned with my actions that you\u2019re too blind to see that you\u2019re just as much of a tease as I am. You\u2019re just unaware of it. Much like I was at your age.\u201d\n\nLucy is suddenly silent at this realization. It\u2019s sort of funny how on the mark you actually were with that statement. You and her father both taught her about this bad new world and she isn\u2019t unintelligent, but for some reason the girl has never really caught on to what a real knock out she is. Perhaps in some way you did shield her a bit from having to be really subjected to the \u201ccurse of beauty\u201d since the carnival is a \u201csafe zone\u201d of sorts.\n\n\u201cBack before the world turned to complete shit I pretty much squandered my natural gifts. Now? I\u2019ve used them to my fullest advantage, but not just for myself, but for you AND this carnival that we all call a family. You\u2019re really lucky Lucy, most people nowadays don\u2019t even have a family to look out for them. Shit, even BEFORE the nukes hit, I didn\u2019t have such a luxury, so if I have to give a little peck on the cheek to some petty tyrant to help us survive, then so be it. Better that I do it than YOU having to do it.\u201d\n\nLucy doesn\u2019t reply, she just looks at you. She knows she wouldn\u2019t have the stomach to go through the act that you go through at times. This might be the first time she realizes the sacrifices you\u2019ve made to make her own life easier.\n\nLucy nods a few times before speaking.\n\n\u201cOkay, mom. I get it. And I appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cGood, that\u2019s all I ask. Okay I\u2019m going back to my own trailer now. We\u2019re heading out tomorrow morning. Get some rest, you deserve it anyway after the wonderful show you put on.\u201d\n\u201cI will mom. Thanks.\u201d Lucy replies.\n\nAs you walk away you see Sparkle, Randy and Hector all slowly sneak back into the trailer.\n\nYou enter your own trailer and lay down on the bed thinking about how far you\u2019ve come in life. It isn\u2019t the life you ever expected, but it isn\u2019t a bad one all things considering.\n\nBefore you fall asleep you look at the old worn clown nose by the nightstand.

We\u2019re just going to leave Billy?\u201d Shrimpy asks.\n\u201cLook, if YOU want to help Billy then go right ahead, but he\u2019s basically said that I\u2019m the low girl on the totem pole, and I am NOT going to go through a bunch of verbal and possible physical abuse for the rest of my time here. I left home to get away from that shit. Quite frankly given how disliked clowns are around here, I\u2019d suggest the rest of you follow me because no matter who wins, you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d You say and turn to leave\n\nLifto, Klepto and Fatty don\u2019t even think twice, they\u2019re following you out the tent and leaving the chaos of the carnival clash behind. Shrimpy however is unsure, his loyalty to his \u201ckind\u201d is still holding him back, but you\u2019re not waiting around.\n\nWhen you exit the tent, things aren\u2019t much better. There aren\u2019t any guardsmen in the immediate area, but you still hear the shooting and their yelling. You also hear odd growling sounds and a couple of screams.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but we need to get to your truck NOW!\u201d you exclaim where upon Lifto takes the lead.\n\nYou don\u2019t get too far when you see Roger staggering from between two other tents. He\u2019s wounded heavily and bleeding profusely. He sees you and desperately calls for your help.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026hel\u2026\u201d is about all he gets out before collapsing a few feet from you. He tries to crawl towards you and you nearly head towards him to help, but given all the gunfire going on and the big brawl still going on, you focus on your goal of placing as much distance as possible from this place.\n\n\u201cSorry, Roger.\u201d You say quietly and continue moving.\n\nLifto points towards a pick up truck in the area where you first parked your own vehicle.\n\n\u201cShh, you hear that?\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d you remark.\n\u201cExactly. All the gunfire stopped.\u201d\n\u201cWell we need to hurry up because that either means the guardsmen killed whoever was attacking and they\u2019ll be returning to us soon or\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then from behind one of the army vehicles you\u2019re passing something leaps onto Lifto. It\u2019s human but its snarling and growling unnaturally. If you didn\u2019t know any better you\u2019d almost think it was a\u2026.\n\n\u201cARGH! ZOMBIE!\u201d Lifto shouts and struggles to get it off of him. Fatty moves in to help immediately and between the two of them they easily knock it to the ground. Lifto then proceeds to stomp on its head repeatedly with his brightly colored clown boots.\n\nWhile Lifto is determined to smash its head into mush, another one of these creatures pop out of nowhere and nearly grab you. You scream and manage to pull away before Klepto steps in and tries to help.\n\nUnfortunately the creatures manage to bite him in the process. He cries out in pain, but manages to get the creatures off of him thanks to someone else helping by blowing the thing\u2019s head off. Blood, bone and brains splatter all over Klepto.\n\n\u201cCome on! I don\u2019t know how many more of these things there are!\u201d Shrimpy shouts with one of the guardsmen\u2019s assault rifles in both hands. Looks like he\u2019s made his choice.\n\nLifto finishes destroying the one that was attacking him and soon all of you are off and running again. You look around as you run thinking more are going to be jumping out at you, but that doesn\u2019t happen. You are slightly concerned about Fatty getting bit though. You don\u2019t think anyone else has noticed it yet except you and of course him.\n\nWhen you get to the truck, Lifto quickly opens up the driver side and opens up the passenger door. You get in, followed by Klepto, meanwhile Fatty gets in the bed of the truck along with Shrimpy.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell are we going?\u201d Lifto says as he drives from the carnival.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet, but we probably should stay away from large areas of population if those\u2026things are any indication. Just head further away from the town for now.\u201d You say.\n\nHonestly you don\u2019t know what comes next, but you\u2019re seriously starting to believe Roofie\u2019s comments about the end coming soon. Were those creatures zombies? Crazed humans? Alive? Undead? Does it matter? How many are there? Have they overrun civilization already? Has any of your old family survived? Is this the beginning of the end?\n\nAnd most importantly\u2026do their bites work like they do in the movies?\n\nKlepto sits next to you nervously still clutching his arm where he was bit. Lifto hasn\u2019t noticed yet because he\u2019s been paying attention to the road and while you haven\u2019t said anything yet Klepto\u2019s not subtle enough about keeping his wound secret\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy do you keep rubbing your arm?\u201d Lifto remarks.\n\u201cUh, that thing grabbed me and its grip hurt a lot and uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKlepto, I\u2019ve known you long enough to know when you\u2019re lying! Did that thing bite you?!\u201d\n\nKlepto doesn\u2019t answer so you try to unsuccessfully help.\n\n\u201cIt was just a little bite, we don\u2019t even know if\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cOh fuck! That\u2019s it man! Game over!\u201d Lifto shouts and suddenly stops the truck. Fatty and Shrimpy both knock on the window shouting what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cKlepto, I know we\u2019ve known each other a long time, but you need to get out of this truck right now.\u201d\n\u201cLifto, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it. Get out before I make you get out or worse.\u201d\n\u201cLifto, we don\u2019t even know if this is infectious! This isn\u2019t a movie you know!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cAnd you willing to take that chance? You\u2019re sitting right next to him! Not to mention he\u2019s covered in that thing\u2019s blood when Shrimpy blew its head off. Who knows what the hell he\u2019s caught.\u201d\n\nAs paranoid as Lifto is right now, you have been feeling a little nervous sitting next to Klepto this whole time.\n\nWithout another word Lifto shifts towards you and reaches over towards the glove compartment. He opens it up revealing a pistol, though Klepto already figured out what he was doing and tries to grab it before Lifto can.\n\nDespite Lifto being in an awkward position and you being in his way, he\u2019s strong enough to get the grip on the gun first. Klepto grabs his hand and the struggle ensues.\n\nAt this point Fatty opens up the driver side door and Shrimpy opens up the passenger side.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here!?\u201d Shrimpy asks.\n\u201cARGH! Sonofabitch!\u201d Lifto suddenly shouts, Klepto has bitten his hand causing him to drop the pistol on the truck floor.\n\u201cShrimpy keep that rifle on Klepto!\u201d Lifto shouts.\n\nYou\u2019re stuck in the middle with Lifto\u2019s body half on you. All you know is you\u2019re scared and desperate to get out. You manage to wiggle down a bit and grab the pistol on the floor.\n\nKlepto hasn\u2019t proceeded with an attack and doesn\u2019t look any different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a zombie! Or whatever you think I am! I\u2019m fine! And if you kill me, you\u2019re going to have to kill Lifto too!\u201d Klepto exclaims to everyone.\n\nKlepto may or may not be right, but he was pretty quick to bite Lifto. Whether that was a desperate attempt to ensure his own safety or a possible glimpse of what\u2019s to come, you don\u2019t know.\n\nWith the pistol in your hand you don\u2019t know if you shouldn\u2019t just shoot them both.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot the pair of them", "result": "You really don\u2019t want to do this, but you don\u2019t see any choice.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d You say and point the gun at Lifto who has just gotten off of you.\n\u201cWait.\u201d he says which is just enough give you pause due to your nervousness and give Lifto time to grab the gun from you, or at least attempt to grab it because you actually manage to struggle for half a minute before he accidently shoots you with it.\n\nThe gun goes off, you catch a bullet in your throat and you fall backwards into Klepto.\n\n\u201cHoly shit! I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d Lifto shouts.\n\u201cSUZY! NO!\u201d Klepto screams.\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do Lifto!?\u201d Fatty yells.\n\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d Shrimpy exclaims.\n\nAt this point the rest of the shouting becomes one loud noise to your dying ears.

JUST FUCKING STOP IT!\u201d you shout pointing the gun towards the truck ceiling. Lifto at this point has returned to his driver\u2019s seat position.\n\n\u201cNOW EVERYONE OUT OF THE TRUCK AND JUST LISTEN!\u201d you say looking at Lifto and briefly glancing back at Klepto.\n\nLifto steps out looks at you as if he is thinking about taking the pistol away from you. He probably could without any problems because as close as you are to shooting someone, you aren\u2019t exactly \u201cthere\u201d yet.\n\nThankfully Lifto doesn\u2019t try anything.\n\nWhen everyone exits the truck, you follow and Shrimpy now stands by you as back up (Fatty doesn\u2019t have a weapon, but he stands near you anyway)\n\n\u201cOkay, Suzy what next?\u201d Lifto calmly says.\n\nYou\u2019ve got an idea, but it would go better if rope was involved. You take a quick look in the truck bed and see some locks and chains sitting there, which will work just as well.\n\n\u201cLook everyone, we don\u2019t have all the information on what this creature situation is, killing someone who got bit, might be jumping the gun. I mean this isn\u2019t a movie!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Klepto says.\n\u201cShut up, I haven\u2019t finished! Of course that doesn\u2019t mean we need to be foolish about this because Lifto could be right. Now Lifto we don\u2019t know if a bite causes infection, but if it does then you\u2019re already doomed unless we cut your hand off, but I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t want that. Do you want that?\u201d\n\nLifto gives a dirty look at Klepto before answering.\n\n\u201cLook if you\u2019re going to shoot me, at least shoot Klepto first so I can watch.\u201d Lifto says.\n\u201c What the\u2026I thought you two were supposed to be friends! (Sigh) I\u2019m trying to give you another option here! Like I said, we don\u2019t know if this sort of thing is contagious. I don\u2019t want any of us to die, do you get that? I\u2019m proposing that the pair of you stay in the bed of the truck until we get to a destination where we can get some medical attention. I mean if the pair of you start not feeling well or different in any way, then we can consider shooting you.\u201d\n\nLifto doesn\u2019t say anything, but Klepto is certainly agreeable.\n\n\u201cSure Suzy, whatever you say! I mean that sounds reasonable to me!\u201d he remarks, though you get the impression he\u2019d go along with what you\u2019d say even if he wasn\u2019t bitten.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to tie you up you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I totally get it.\u201d Klepto remarks.\n\u201cLifto?\u201d\n\nHe exhales and doesn\u2019t say anything while looking at his hand. Then he looks back at you.\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t want any of us to die?\u201d Lifto asks.\n\u201cNo. Why the hell would I want that? I mean if these are the end days coming then we\u2019re all we have left! We need to stick together as much as possible. And in any case you lot are the closest I\u2019ve had to family for years, well other than the fact that most of you are undressing me with your eyes half the time\u2026but I\u2019m getting off track my point is that despite all the fucked up shit that\u2019s occurred this week, I know I want you guys in my corner. All of you.\u201d\n\nAt first you wonder if you\u2019ve laid it on a bit too much, but you hear a couple of sniffles in Fatty\u2019s direction and Klepto is obviously showing signs of emotion. He probably thinks you just professed your love for him or something.\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay. We\u2019ll do it your way, but if I start to turn or if I think I\u2019m going to become something other than I am, then I want YOU to be the one to shoot me.\u201d Lifto says.\n\u201cWell let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that, but I promise.\u201d You say.\n\nWith those words Lifto and Klepto both submit to being chained up and to sit in the truck bed. Lifto is still giving Klepto angry looks, but hopefully they can work out their differences during the ride.\n\nFatty takes the wheel, Shrimpy gets in the middle and you sit near the passenger\u2019s side. You\u2019ve never exactly been the best with directions, so you just tell Fatty to stay on the main road and hopefully you\u2019ll reach a place that is in better shape than your own home town which probably is a warzone by now. You can\u2019t help but wonder how your real family is doing, but really you\u2019d rather not dwell on it.\n\nFatty turns on the radio in the hopes of finding out something, but he doesn\u2019t get much other than a few random religious stations talking about salvation and end times, but those things are ALWAYS talking about the end times so its hard to tell if they\u2019re even referring to what\u2019s currently going on. You\u2019d think something like the news or an emergency broadcast might pop up, but nothing. Oddly you do get some stations just playing nothing but those infernal Ground Zero advertisements.\n\nHours pass of driving through farm country and Klepto and Lifto aren\u2019t moaning or even arguing so you\u2019re guessing that they\u2019re feeling okay. Still, even though you don\u2019t want any of them to die, you do know it still might be a possibility.\n\nAs it begins to turn to night you\u2019re already tired from the events of the day. Feeling somewhat safe you allow yourself to close your eyes and drift off as the truck drives onward.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026don\u2019t delay, buy a Ground Zero shelter today!\u201d\n\n\u201cFatty turn that radio off, there hasn\u2019t been anything on it of importance for hours. It\u2019s just those damn Ground Zero ads. Christ, you\u2019d think someone would be reporting about oh you know a zombie apocalypse?\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cI still say those things are still alive. The ones we saw didn\u2019t look like they came back from the dead or anything.\u201d Fatty remarks.\n\u201cWell whatever, still seems like reporting SOME sort of outbreak would be of importance.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe its local and not happening anywhere else?\u201d\n\nAt this point your eyes open and you completely rouse from your sleep.\n\n\u201c(Yawn) What\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving all night?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSomewhat. Fatty here pulled over at one point and we both slept a little. If you\u2019re wondering about the gruesome twosome back there, we checked on them and from what I can tell both of them feel fine. In fact I think they\u2019re both still sleeping. Guess all that bite drama yesterday really exhausted them. Dunno if that means they\u2019re okay or not, but right now we do have another problem.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell Fatty here managed to get us fucking lost.\u201d\n\u201cHey it\u2019s not my fault, I couldn\u2019t see shit in the night and I thought we were on a main road. Damn GPS.\u201d Fatty says.\n\u201cTold you that it was broken and hasn\u2019t worked correctly for years. Anyway, I know you\u2019re native to this area so I\u2019m hoping you know your way around.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\nA brief glance of the practically non-descript landscape to the left and right of you leaves you at a loss.\n\n\u201cSorry, but like I said, I never was a big traveller. Never left the basement if I could help it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. Well any suggestion regardless of that fact?\u201d Shrimpy asks.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any, though you probably should be near some sort of farmhouse as you do know there are some out this way. You could get your bearing by stopping at one and asking for directions.\n\nYou also remember Fatty\u2019s comment about supplies.\n\n\u201cThere should be some sort of farmhouse nearby. Just keep driving along this road and we\u2019ll probably hit one where we can ask for directions and possibly get supplies.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like as good of an idea as any.\u201d\n\nYou really don\u2019t know if that will be the case, you\u2019re just hoping at this point.\n\nFortunately, your hopes come true this time.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a house. Can\u2019t tell if anyone is home or not though.\u201d Fatty says pulling up to a large traditional looking farmhouse.\n\u201cOkay, so how are we doing this?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose I\u2019ll go up to the front door and see if anyone\u2019s home and the rest of you guys stay in the truck.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou nuts? This place looks like it\u2019s out of a horror movie! Might be a bunch of psycho rednecks living in there! They see a pretty young thing like you and they\u2019d grab you before we could even do anything.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cRight like arriving at a door with a group of clowns isn\u2019t straight out of a horror movie. I\u2019m currently the only one dressed in regular clothing and not covered in blood, I think it would be best if I just asked for help at first.\u201d\n\u201cHey what are we going to do with Klepto and Lifto?\u201d Fatty asks.\n\u201cWell check on them again and if they seem to be well unchain them I guess. I mean they could use a stretch. Anyway like I said I\u2019m going to the door. I\u2019m taking the pistol with me and I\u2019m confident that if something does happen you\u2019ll be able to react in time to save me from getting chopped up or whatever you think is going to happen. We need help getting back on track and looking at the gauge we might even need gas so hopefully they got that here too. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d You say and get out of the truck.\n\nYou make your way towards the front porch looking around the entire time. This place is creepily quiet. Seems like you should at least hear the sounds of animals or something. Shrimpy\u2019s got you totally paranoid now. You really weren\u2019t worried until he mentioned psycho hillbillies. You look back at the truck.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it Suzy, you need to brave through some of this shit yourself. You survived your serial killer uncle for Christsake. Nothing is going to happen, probably just some kindly old farm couple that lives here.\u201d You mutter to yourself and walk up the stairs and knock on the door.\n\nYou knock several times with no answer, but just when you\u2019re about to give up it opens.\n\n\u201cWHO YOU!?\u201d a large disfigured man exclaims completely scaring the shit out of you and causing you to fall backwards.\n\nYou\u2019re in a state of utter fear as this large freak approaches you with his hand outstretched towards you\u2026\n\nEven in your fearful condition, you\u2019re still able to react to a dangerous situation. You pull the pistol that you had on you and shoot the disfigured man. You hit him twice in the body and he reels backwards bellowing loudly as his body hits the front door and then the house\u2019s front room floor.\n\n\u201cWHHHHHHY!? GOING TO HELP YOU!\u201d the man shouts.\n\n\u201cJunior? What in tarnation is goin\u2019 on down there? I hope you didn\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot carrying your father\u2019s rifles again, you know how he hates a waste of ammo.\u201d An older female voice shouts from inside.\n\u201cMAMA! MAMA! HURT A LOT! BAD GIRL HURT ME!\u201d the man cries.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been fightin\u2019 with you\u2019re sister again\u2026oh my god\u2026JUNIOR! CLEM SOMEONE SHOT JUNIOR!\u201d you hear the older female voice scream.\n\nBy this time you\u2019re running back to the truck, which Shrimpy has gotten out of. Lifto and Klepto are also both awake and shouting at this point.\n\n\u201cGet back in the fucking truck! We gotta\u2026\u201d you start yelling and then a shot from one of the farmhouse windows rings out. You hear it whiz by your ear causing you to drop to the ground immediately.\n\nYou continue to crawl towards the truck where you hear more gunfire behind you and the sounds of an assault rifle returning fire. You hear someone trying to start the truck, but a few more shots hitting metal seem to put an end to that causing the engine to make a less than operational sound.\n\n\u201cFatty get out of the front seat!\u201d Shrimpy shouts.\n\nYou hear more gunshots followed by Fatty crying out, though you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s actually gotten hit severely since you just hear \u201cOW MY ASS!\u201d\n\nThe whole time you\u2019re praying that you don\u2019t get shot in the back, but you\u2019re the lucky one\u2026\n\nEver the white knight, Klepto attempts to go \u201crescue\u201d you.\n\n\u201cKlepto get out of the open!\u201d you hear Lifto shout.\n\u201cSuzy\u2019s out there I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Klepto\u2019s words are cut short when a bullet to his skull drops him. In fact he drops about a few feet in front of you. You try to put the sight of his death out of your mind as you continue to crawl towards the truck.\n\n\u201cYOU FUCKERS AREN\u2019T TAKING THIS FARM! THIS FARM IS MINE! ALL OF YOU SONSOFBITCHES ARE GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY BOY!\u201d a male voice shouts.\n\nYou finally reach your destination where the rest are hiding behind the back of the truck, though Fatty\u2019s having a hard time of it due to his size and the fact he\u2019s got a bullet in his ass.\n\nThe shooting on both sides for now has stopped though.\n\n\u201cShit, shit, shit, Klepto\u2019s dead! That redneck bastard says that we\u2019re going to pay, no fucking way, HE\u2019S gonna fuckin\u2019 pay!\u201d Lifto says which is a bit surprising considering that he was ready to kill Klepto himself just yesterday.\n\n\u201cFuck, my ass\u2026ah! Shit\u2026wish I had a gun, I\u2019d shoot that fucker in the ass. Not the cheek either, the fucking HOLE!\u201d Fatty says who is normally calm, but given he got shot his anger is a bit understandable.\n\n\u201cWell luckily I picked up a few extra clips back at the carnival and Suzy\u2019s probably still got a few shots left. I say we can probably take out the shooter with a bit of strategy. Just as soon as we come up with one of course.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how to feel about all this. Maybe it\u2019s all the increased violence over the past few days along with losing Klepto, but your clown crew is starting to become a lot more vicious, though events haven\u2019t exactly been encouraging a peaceful life lately.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but feel a little responsible for this current situation though. The retard was just trying to help you up from your fall, but you couldn\u2019t have known that\u2026you just reacted to your fear. You were the one who harmed the farm inhabitants first even if the rest of your clown friends think you were being attacked.\n\nPart of you wants to just run from this place, but where would you go? Staying of course means doing more things you don\u2019t necessarily want to do\u2026but then you think if you can put yourself in the \u201cright\u201d frame of mind you\u2019ll be able to do it.\n\nThe farmer HAS tried to kill all of you and did succeed in killing Klepto who attempted to save you, surely revenge for that isn\u2019t totally wrong?", "action_results": [{"action": "Get revenge", "result": "If you ran, you doubt if the rest of them would follow and despite the feeling that this isn\u2019t the greatest idea, you\u2019re tired of running. You\u2019ve got nothing to run to anyway, if you can deal with the inhabitants inside, you\u2019ll at least have a place to catch a breather from the ever-growing chaos in your life.\n\nYou hope at least.\n\n\u201cShrimpy can you get inside the truck without getting hit and put it in neutral?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I think I could.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cGood, give me the rifle and the clips, get in the truck and when it\u2019s in neutral Lifto and Fatty I want you to start pushing it forward. We should be able to get close enough to the house using this thing as a large shield.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to be doing?\u201d Fatty asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be crawling around in the truck bed taking shots at that bastard firing at us when I can. Hopefully the closer we get the more likely I\u2019ll be able to hit him. Now you want to avenge Klepto or what?\u201d\n\nThis statement gets a nod from everyone.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d Lifto says and all of you enact your plan.\n\nIt goes well, or about as well as a plan can when someone is shooting at you. Another person soon joins the farmer the closer the truck gets to the front of the house. Presumably the farmer\u2019s wife. The pair of them unleash a torrent of curses at you, but nobody is hitting each other yet.\n\nBullets tear into the truck and while you\u2019re all safe, when the two front tires get blown out, it makes Lifto and Fatty\u2019s pushing a lot harder.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it. (Wheeze)\u201d Fatty gasps.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Lifto grunts.\n\nStill crawling around in the truck bed, you head over towards the back and speak to Lifto and Fatty.\n\u201cOkay, stop pushing, no point in straining yourself, because you\u2019re going to need to save your energy. I don\u2019t think the shooter on the left is quite as skilled so run to the left and around the back of the house, there\u2019s got to be a back door. I\u2019ll provide cover, I still got a half a clip left in this thing and one more full one, so when I go full auto, start running. Here take the pistol.\u201d You say tossing the pistol over the back end of the truck.\n\nHonestly you\u2019d rather have Shrimpy do this since he\u2019s a much smaller target, but the little guy is probably hiding in the leg area of either the driver or passenger\u2019s side of the truck hoping not to get hit.\n\nYou take a deep breath as more bullets tear into the sides of the truck. You grip the rifle and exposing only a bit of your hands, you blindly fire and spray the left area of the house where the second shooter is.\n\nLuckily through the gunfire a small cry is heard, you think you\u2019ve hit someone again.\n\nIn any case it allows time for Lifto and Fatty to crouch run towards the house, hug the wall and then crawl around the corner. Fatty sure is fast when he wants to be, you just hope he doesn\u2019t suffer a heart attack. Meanwhile you hear shouting within the house.\n\n\u201cClem! I\u2019m hit! Ohhhhh\u2026(sob)\u201d\n\u201cHoneypie?! Honeypie? No no no\u2026\u201d\n\nWith the gunfire completely stopped Shrimpy takes the opportunity to get out of the truck and run behind it.\n\n\u201cSuzy? You still here?\u201d you hear him ask.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still here. Just stay behind the truck I\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d you start to say before you\u2019re interrupted\n\n\u201cNO! GODAMNIT! NOOOO! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU ALL!\u201d Clem the farmer shouts and now the sounds of gunfire start up again, except this time he\u2019s not firing a rifle anymore, the booming sound indicates a shotgun of some kind.\n\nAs you try to reload your last assault rifle clip, the truck continues to suffer the impact of shotgun rounds. In fact they are starting to damage the truck enough that one of them going through and hitting you is a very real possibility. You roll over to the other side of the truck in an attempt not to get hit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019LL KILL ALL OF YOU!\u201d you hear him bellow. You\u2019re too busy keeping down and redloading.\n\nAnd then you hear nothing, followed by a pistol shot and then another. You take the opportunity to quickly climb out of the truck bed altogether.\n\n\u201cSuzy, did they get him?\u201d Shrimpy asks\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d you say and peek your head out hoping that this isn\u2019t a mistake.\n\nYou soon see Lifto standing in the front doorway with the pistol in hand.\n\n\u201cWe got all of these bastards. It\u2019s safe.\u201d He says.\n\nYou and Shrimpy both step out from the cover of the truck and make your way to the house.\n\nFirst thing you notice is the first man you shot near the entryway, apparently he tried to crawl away soon after the shoot out started and died shortly afterwards. Given his disfigurement and from what you could tell of his voice, he might\u2019ve been mentally retarded. You remember hearing \u201cjunior\u201d being said, so you\u2019re guessing he was the son. You don\u2019t exactly feel great about shooting him. It really was an accident.\n\nSeeing the other two bodies don\u2019t exactly make you feel any better.\n\nThe farmer\u2019s wife lies dead in the dining room area. She\u2019s actually bigger than Fatty which means she\u2019s indeed quite on the large side. She has several gunshot wounds to her upper body. You knew you hit her, but you just didn\u2019t know where. Your stomach begins to feel slightly bad when you think about it.\n\nFinally you see the farmer himself, or Clem as you heard being shouted. Lifto mentions that Clem was so focused on you that he realized too late that someone was sneaking up on him. Lifto mentions that he shot him in the back and then while Clem was still flopping about on the floor trying to turn over with his shotgun, Clem put one in his skull.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even kill Clem and you still feel weird about it. You don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re feeling slightly sick about all this. Or rather you\u2019ve got an idea why, but considering the little creature rampage at the carnival it isn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t seen gruesome death before, but this is somehow different.\n\nThe adrenaline and survivalist mindset you put yourself into has disappeared now that the danger has passed so you are left with the grim aftermath of your actions.\n\nThe realization that you\u2019ve killed an entire family that was really just defending their home is what is getting to you. That and the fact that you feel like this whole incident is your fault. Adding Klepto\u2019s death to the mix and you\u2019re directly and indirectly responsible for four people\u2019s deaths.\n\n\u201cToilet.\u201d You say in a daze.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shrimpy asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be sick\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI think I saw one over towards the back of the house, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t wait for Lifto to finish you just run in the direction. Trying to keep from throwing up and you just manage to make it to the toilet where upon you promptly vomit your guts out.\n\nYour fellows come to see how you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cSuzy, are you alright?\u201d Shrimpy asks.\n\u201cYeah, you aren\u2019t sick are you?\u201d Lifto asks.\n\nIt takes you awhile to answer, but eventually you manage it.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026(pant)\u2026I just\u2026I dunno\u2026yeah I\u2019ll be fine. I think the stress of all this just got to me. Uh\u2026\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s understandable. Look, why don\u2019t you go lie down somewhere? You\u2019ve done enough for today. The rest of us are gonna drag these bodies out of here. It\u2019ll take all of us, lord knows what the hell they were eating on this farm, but everyone here seems to be Fatty\u2019s size or bigger. Probably should look around the rest of the farm as well. Make sure nobody is hiding in the barns or something.\u201d Lifto remarks.\n\u201cYeah\u2026okay\u2026\u201d you say walking past Shrimpy and Lifto.\n\nAs you slowly walk back towards the front of the house, Fatty comes down the stairs.\n\n\u201cWell the upstairs is clear from what I can tell. Nobody up there. Hey Suzy, you okay? Could hear you retching from up there.\u201d Fatty asks.\n\u201cYeah, just need to lie down.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou and me both, but I suppose Lifto is going to need me to help him move out these bodies. Anyway, there are some nice beds upstairs, probably should take one of them.\u201d\n\nAt this point you feel so wobbly that you wonder if you can even make it up the stairs.", "action_results": [{"action": "Use the upstairs bedrooms", "result": "Given that everyone is going to be making a bunch of noise, moving bodies and such downstairs, you decide to head upstairs. You think you could really use the solitude anyway. You think you\u2019ve spent more time in the close company of people this week than you have in your entire life and that includes when you had a boyfriend.\n\nWith everyone else doing a bit of cleaning up, your mind goes a bit numb as you go up the creaky stairs. You put everything that you\u2019ve experienced this week out of your head. All you want to think about right now is resting from this ordeal.\n\nYou reach the landing and look to your left and see a room which is fairly messy to the point of being disgusting. You hear flies buzzing in there and it smells like something died in there, which doesn\u2019t improve how you\u2019re already feeling. You guess that this was probably the son\u2019s room. You close the door so as to keep the odor in and move on.\n\nAcross the hall you find a much better room with a big bed. You guess that Clem and his wife slept here, or maybe just his wife, given her size. Unfortunately that smell from Junior\u2019s room is still strong enough for this room to catch a bit of the fallout. You can\u2019t rest here either so you move on again.\n\nYou pass another bathroom and then at the far end you find another bedroom. This one is free of a bad smell and has a comfortable looking bed so you immediately go to it.\n\nYou collapse on the bed, with a deep exhale. You lie there in silence for a moment trying to wrap your mind around the situation.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Ohhhh\u2026shit\u2026never should\u2019ve left the basement.\u201d You say.\n\nYou think about what might\u2019ve happened had you actually stayed home earlier this week rather than going with the idea to go join the circus. You also wonder what would\u2019ve happened had you gone to live with your younger sister or even made up with Bobby. You then remember of how the National Guard were stationed in your town and then there were those creatures (Still don\u2019t know what that was all about or if Lifto is out of the woods as far as that\u2019s concerned) so chances are things might\u2019ve still turned out hectic.\n\n\u201cI was fucked no matter what.\u201d You laugh as your eyes start to close a bit. In fact you laugh quite a bit. You laugh at this entire hell week.\n\nIt may be your mind trying to cope and a combination of being tired, or you may have snapped a little but in any event you can\u2019t stop quietly giggling to yourself.\n\nAnd then as you\u2019re in your minor giggling fit, your eyes stay open longer when you begin to realize your surroundings.\n\nThis room. This is the room of a young female. There is a whole area dedicated to make up and such. The walls have a flowery print. You even see a few feminine undergarments sitting on top of a dresser.\n\nYou then remember back when you first shot Junior, his mother telling him that he had better not be fighting with his sister again. Funny what you remember during intense situations.\n\nThere were only three dead bodies, which means the daughter of this family is still alive and possibly hiding somewhere. Fatty said he searched upstairs, but he could\u2019ve missed something.\n\nAnd a quick glance to your left you see a closet door slightly askew, which then begins to open further.\n\nFeeling a sudden burst of energy brought on by danger, you manage to sit up and get off the bed just in time for the owner of this room to reveal herself. Apparently she thought you were going to be easier pickings than Fatty, she finds out how dreadfully wrong she is.\n\nYou immediately rush at the woman who holds a large knife in one hand. It\u2019s enough to catch her off guard and she fails to hit you with the knife or rather fails to hit you in a meaningful way since the blade does slice your upper arm.\n\nThe pair of you fall to the closet floor where she slams her head against the wall. You grab the hand holding the knife and smash it on the doorway until she drops it. You feel a punch to your face by her other hand, but you ignore the pain and with all your weight you slam your elbow into her nose.\n\nYou stop her from crying out by following that up with a punch to her mouth. You repeatedly punch her in the face to a point where she temporarily stops resisting entirely. Clothing is falling on the pair of you and you grab a shirt and wrap it around her throat and pull tightly. Your mind goes into a very dark place.\n\n\u201cShhhh\u2026it\u2019ll all be over soon, just let the darkness take you\u201d you whisper.\n\nThe woman gasps for air and tries to punch and scratch at you, but you manage to pull your head back just enough for her to miss. She tries to wiggle and squirm away, but you\u2019re sitting right on her stomach and there\u2019s nowhere for her to go. The woman continues to choke and tries to pry your hands away, but she\u2019s unable to do so and her struggle becomes less intense.\n\n\u201c\u2026there we go\u2026now you\u2019ll be with your family forever\u2026\u201d you say and watch her face turn unhealthy shade due to lack of oxygen and her eyes roll up into her head.\n\nThe woman stops breathing and the deed is done. You don\u2019t even feel tired anymore, it\u2019s like killing her energized you or something. You don\u2019t have the sick feeling either. You just went into a kind of trance. Like this woman was garbage that needed to be disposed of. You wonder if this is what your Uncle Ed felt when he killed whores.\n\nIf you were in your old frame of mind, you\u2019d know how fucked up that is. In your current state of mind you still know how fucked up that is, however you no longer care.\n\nSomething may very well have snapped within you, whether it was a combination of the entire week, or just this one bad day, the damage has been done and you\u2019re not quite the same person that you were anymore. She was going to kill you and you stopped her from doing so, that\u2019s the important thing. Nothing else. You survived. There are no limits to what you\u2019re capable of, you realize that now.\n\n\u201cSuzy!? Hey are you okay up there?! I heard some noise!\u201d you hear Lifto shout.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, just looking through a closet before I get some rest. Some shit fell, no worries!\u201d you shout back.\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d\n\nWith that interruption out of the way you turn your attention back to your situation. You start looking around the room and find lots of make up. You also go through her clothing and notice a lot of it is about your size though a bit on the slutty side. Oddly enough after going through some more personal belongings you find out her name was Susie too. Or Susie Mae to be precise.\n\nAfter pulling out some of the clothing from the closet you shove the rest of Susie Mae's body into it and shut the door.\n\n\u201cHmm, yeah I think I could make a new outfit out of this stuff.\u201d You remark. You then grab the scissors and sewing material that lies nearby. It\u2019s been awhile since you\u2019ve done any seamstress type stuff, but you remember when your mother taught you to do it when you were in your elementary school plays. Hopefully you\u2019ve retained enough of the knowledge.\n\nYou spend the rest of the day in Susie Mae\u2019s room on your own personal project. It\u2019s the most solitude you\u2019ve had in a long time and you happily enjoy it. The rest of your compatriots are busy searching the rest of the farm for the most part though at one point Shrimpy comes up and asks if you\u2019re okay.\n\n\u201cSuzy? Hey thought you\u2019d be asleep\u2026what are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t exactly have any extra clothes anymore. Even my clown stuff was left back at the carnival, so I\u2019m making a new wardrobe, what\u2019s up?\u201d you ask not looking up from what you\u2019re doing.\n\u201cUm, well just wanted to let you know that we\u2019ve checked out this entire farm and the place seems all clear and well stocked too.\u201d Shrimpy remarks.\n\u201cAre Fatty and Lifto okay?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, yeah Fatty\u2019s fine, wasn\u2019t fun digging that bullet out of his ass though. As for Lifto he seems fine too. Don\u2019t think Klepto biting him did anything and he\u2019s cleaned out the wound at this point so I guess he\u2019s in the clear. Speaking of Klepto, we uh\u2026were thinking we should at least bury him. We already dug the hole in a nice spot. Maybe we should have a small funeral tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cI think that sounds like a fine idea\u2026guess I better finish this thing if I\u2019m attending a funeral.\u201d You reply.\n\nShrimpy pauses for a moment.\n\n\u201cSuzy are you really okay? You seem different somehow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just fine Shrimpy. Just fine. I really need to focus on this though.\u201d\n\u201cUm, okay sure. We\u2019ll let you know if anything important pops up.\u201d Shrimpy says and leaves you.\n\nYou aren\u2019t disturbed for the rest of the day or night; in fact they all must sleep downstairs which gives you free reign of the upstairs bathroom to wash up a bit.\n\nAfter washing up you try on your now finished project. Your outfit is a patchwork of colorful chaos since you just cut up lots of clothing and sewed bits of them together, but you\u2019re pleased with your work. In fact you\u2019re so pleased with it, you fall asleep in it figuring that it\u2019ll save you a bit of time to get ready for Klepto\u2019s funeral tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\u201cSuzy?

I\u2019ll be ready in a moment.\u201d You say applying make up on your face.\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re all about as ready as we\u2019re going to be, Lifto and Fatty have already put Klepto\u2019s body in the hole we dug, so we\u2019re all about as ready for this thing as we\u2019re going to be. See you downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cHey Shrimpy can I say a few things at this event?\u201d you ask before he walks away from the door.\n\u201cYou mean like a eulogy? Sure I mean if you\u2019ve got something to say then by all means go for it. Really we were all trying to come up with something formal, but I think we\u2019re all still a little exhausted. Lifto actually broke down in tears yesterday about Klepto\u2019s death. I think he\u2019s upset that he tried to kill him just the day before and wishes their last moments were on friendlier terms.\u201d\n\u201cWell, tell Lifto that the time for tears and regrets will soon be a thing of the past. I\u2019m almost done, see you downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror and finish applying lipstick. Not the exact shade of red you wanted, but it was the only lipstick that the previous owner hadn\u2019t used yet. You\u2019re just glad the girl had as much make up as she did so you could paint up your face proper.\n\nSatisfied with your face, you stand up and look at yourself in the nearby full length mirror.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not my old carnival outfit, but yeah\u2026 this is definitely me now. Now and forever.\u201d you say and walk towards the door.\n\nBefore leaving you stop and look towards the closet.\n\n\u201cThank you for letting me borrow your make up and clothing.\u201d You say and then giggle a bit.\n\nYou skip down the stairs and meet up with the rest. They\u2019re all a bit more somber than you and are quite surprised to see your slightly energetic temperament.\n\n\u201cSuzy? That\u2019s a uh interesting outfit.\u201d Fatty remarks.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it though? Made it myself. Nothing like a new set of clothes to put you in a different mindset! In fact given that all of you have been running around in the same clothes for day on end, I\u2019d say that all of you could use new clothes too. Those rags must be really filthy by now; you\u2019ll all probably feel a lot more positive about things once you change. I\u2019m sure we can gather up enough of this family of deadnecks\u2019 clothing and I can make you all something. Anyway, we can talk about this later let us be on our way.\u201d\n\nEveryone is a unsure of how to react to your new chipperish behavior especially given the circumstances, but they all just lead the way to Klepto\u2019s open grave which has been dug out in the backyard of the house.\n\nKlepto still looks about as dead as he did that last time you saw him, though someone has arranged his body in a respectful way. He even has some freshly pulled flowers in his hand.\n\n\u201cThe flowers are a nice touch.\u201d You remark not knowing who did it.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Lifto says wiping away a tear.\n\u201cShrimpy probably told you all that I was going to do a bit of a eulogy, but does anyone have anything else to say?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we were all trading Klepto stories last night. We\u2019ll probably be doing it for a while. None of us are really good for formal speeches though, probably best if you do it. Besides, it means a lot that you want to do it despite not knowing any of us that long.\u201d Shrimpy says.\n\u201cGlad you feel that way because what I\u2019m going to say is going to be towards all of you\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd before you can finish that thought. Your eyes (and everyone else\u2019s) catch sight of something quite spectacular in the distance.\n\nA mushroom cloud.\n\nYou\u2019re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn\u2019t engulfed you, so you\u2019re guessing that it wasn\u2019t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn\u2019t much that can done about it.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be damned, the world finally went and did it\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nLifto, Fatty and Shrimpy all at the same time begin to swear and react to the situation as most people would, namely panic, fear and hysteria. You think in the old days you probably would have too, but not anymore. If anything this is excellent timing for your new outlook on life.\n\nYou quickly call everyone to attention.\n\n\u201cHey! Listen up! This might be the end of civilization as we know it, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world! Sure life is going to be harder now, but look at we\u2019ve already survived. Just this damn week we suffered through a military occupation, an internal civil war, an attack by freaks, and took down a bunch of rednecks trying to murder us.\u201d\n\nAt this point they\u2019re all listening to you intently.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll survive this and as long as we stick together there isn\u2019t anything we can\u2019t do. This is a new beginning and it\u2019ll be us against the world if necessary. We are a family and I love you guys.\u201d You say.\n\nThese words are met with a pause and then of course positive approval by all and everyone goes in for a bit of a group hug. Feelings run a bit high and some more tears are shed.\n\nWhile your words are genuine and do have feeling behind them, but your mind is still in a dark place. You do see them all as family, but you also can\u2019t help see them as useful \u201ctools\u201d in the chaos that\u2019s going to come. Even now you\u2019re sizing them all up on their weaknesses and strengths.\n\nIn any case, you and everyone finish up by completing the burial of Klepto and gathering all the supplies from the farm that will be needed. You all know you\u2019ll run out eventually, but for now you\u2019ve got enough supplies to ponder a long range plan of your future.\n\nNo longer are you the shy \u201cgood\u201d girl who hid away in the basement, harassed by your family and living as one day blurred into the next.

Looks like that new recruit has got the right attitude!\u201d you say watching a young man wearing an outlandish green wig and novelty nose glasses swing his machete into the skull of another young man who was previously begging for his life.\n\u201cHrm. Wasn\u2019t too sure about him at first, but I guess he\u2019s proven himself on this raid. Speaking of which, looks like we\u2019ve made a good haul.

I hate those religious types.\u201d Howdy says.\n\u201cWhile I have no doubt that town of pious zealots is well stocked, they\u2019re also very well armed. In fact I\u2019ve been hearing rumors that they\u2019ve been launching their own little crusade against neighboring settlements.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI heard that they went complete Spanish Inquisition on one town. Crucified most of them and burned the rest alive. That was of course after they already had tortured the shit out of all of them.\u201d Lifto adds.\n\u201cSo? We could take those assholes.\u201d Howdy remarks.\n\u201cThat may be, but not in the near future. It would be a very dangerous undertaking and we are not doing this for the risks and to prove how badass we are. We\u2019re doing this for survival\u2026well that and to have a little fun in the process.\u201d You say with a smile, though Howdy is still one of your more \u201cmacho\u201d members and still wants to prove he\u2019s got a dick by killing something.\n\nYou reach out to his face with a gentle touch and soothing voice.\n\n\u201cI know you like to kill things, but I don\u2019t want you to get killed in the process. Just because we tend to pick easier targets just means I really don\u2019t want you or any one of us to get killed. We\u2019re all family and I don\u2019t want to see any one of you die, you understand? That\u2019s why our mode of operation is to go for low risk, high reward and I\u2019d say its work for all these years wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I suppose it has.\u201d Howdy says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Anyway it\u2019s looking like we have hit every place that\u2019s worthwhile around here. We should start heading east and raid merchant caravans coming out of those city-states.

Glad that part of my life is over.\u201d\n\u201cNot just the old days, but people as well like Fatty, Shrimpy\u2026 Klepto.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s different. I do miss them. They were family and I\u2019ll never forget them. We sure had some fun times back at that farmhouse remember?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, yeah. Shame what happened; maybe we could\u2019ve made a more stable life there rather than doing this raider thing.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but we can\u2019t dwell on what if in the past. Just have to focus on today and if possible, the future. That\u2019s what\u2019s kept us alive and allowed us to build our new family.\u201d You say and touch Lifto\u2019s hand.\n\nLifto looks and smiles at you.

At least you\u2019ve got a few extra clothes.\n\nYou walk for quite some time and a couple vehicles pass you, but once again nobody offers you a ride. Looks like the clown outfit might be warding off people. As they say, there is nothing funny about a clown in the moonlight.\n\nThere is also nothing funny about two rednecks in a pick up truck at night either\u2026\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly who rides up along side you. A fear wells up within you, but you try to ignore it.\n\n\u201cWoo weee! Look at chu\u2019. You from dat carnival a few miles up dah road?\u201d one of them shouts from the passenger side.\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u201cMm, yeah I don\u2019t usually go fer clowns\u2026but damn are you fine. You fill out that outfit something fierce! You remind me of that girl from the funny books. Y\u2019know that crazy guy\u2019s girlfriend who fights that bat guy.\u201d\n\nYou continue to try to ignore him and step up your pace.\n\n\u201cSo, you need a lift back to your carnival sweetheart? We got room.\u201d\n\u201cNo, the back of your truck looks full of scrap metal.\u201d\n\u201cOh honey, you wouldn\u2019t ride back there. You\u2019d ride up here with us. Maybe you could even sit in my lap.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re starting to get worried now.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Thanks though.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think yer understandin\u2019 me missy, this ain\u2019t a fuckin\u2019 request! Hugo stop the goddamn truck, this one\u2019s gonna give us shit!\u201d the hick says and you don\u2019t even waste time, you start running before he even gets out of the truck.\n\nIt\u2019s a long dark lonely road and you\u2019re a young woman screaming and running from psycho hillbillies. It would sound like a bad horror movie if it weren\u2019t actually happening.\n\nSo far you\u2019re out pacing them so you figure if you stick to the road you\u2019ll be fine and maybe even be lucky enough to have someone pass by to help you.\n\nYou look back and see the one from the passenger seat still far behind you, in fact you don\u2019t even see the other one. But you do hear shouting by the one chasing you.\n\nIn a few moments you hear the sound of an engine see the glow of headlights right behind you. They\u2019re not going to bother chasing you so much as they\u2019re just going to run you down!\n\nAt this point you get off the road and you do, but the truck just follows you into the high grass and at the speed it\u2019s going it succeeds in hitting you at a good speed. You go flying several feet way into the field.\n\nYou still live, but your body is broken in several places. You cry out followed by several whimpers of someone to help you. Of course there is no one and all it does is let the two hicks know where you\u2019ve landed. You can\u2019t even crawl away.\n\nIn a few moments the truck pulls up near your area and your fear and anguish is overwhelming you. This is it. This is how it\u2019s going to end.\n\n\u201cHeard that bitch scream, she\u2019s gotta be here somewhere\u2026got her.\u201d The hillbilly says shining a flashlight in your bloody face.\n\n\u201cSheet. You ain\u2019t much now are ya bitch? If you\u2019d gotten in when I told ya, We might\u2019ve even let ya go after we were done havin\u2019 our fun. But noooo, you stuck up pretty bitches always gotta do things da hard way. Fuck it.

You\u2019re going to have to move out and go live at the only place available to an unemployed bum like yourself, your friend Julie\u2019s house.\n\nChances are she\u2019s either passed out, hung over or in the middle of yet another one of her seemingly never ending parties, so you figure calling her will be useless and call your sister Donna instead (who might only be slightly more available)\n\nIgnoring Bobby\u2019s calls, you speed dial Donna and surprisingly she picks up after only a couple of rings. Even more surprisingly you don\u2019t hear any music or noise in the background. Must\u2019ve caught a rare in between party time.\n\n\u201cHello?

I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen by the end of the week and in any case I don\u2019t think I can take her abuse any longer.

I wouldn\u2019t mind and I mean you know Julie would be fine with it, but I know you\u2019re not exactly miss fun and excitement and I think you\u2019re aware of how wild things can get over here.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cYeah, but anything is better than continuing to live with Kelly right now, and given how big Julie\u2019s home is, I\u2019m sure I can still find a quiet corner to not bother anyone in.\u201d you respond.\n\u201cOkay, well as long as you don\u2019t because a buzz killing party pooper, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay here. So are you coming today?\u201d\n\u201cI think I need to pack up quite a bit of stuff before doing that. I also have to have some way of transporting the stuff over.

Besides, he\u2019d probably just try to convince me to live in his compound and I\u2019m just not in the mood to deal.\u201d\n\u201cHrm. I certainly understand that. Well, since you said you\u2019re going to have to spend a little time packing up your stuff, I can come pick you up tomorrow. I\u2019d do it today, but the vehicle situation isn\u2019t ideal right now.

You didn\u2019t own too much stuff, and stuff like furniture or a bed is going to be provided at Julie\u2019s house though you wonder if you shouldn\u2019t move your bed over there if only because the beds over there are probably like petri dishes.\n\nIn any event, you spend the rest of your night in the basement, which will probably be your last night ever here. It seems weird and scary, but on another level you are a little excited.

You just hope that she remembers to come get you period. While your sister isn\u2019t as flaky as Julie, she still doesn\u2019t have the greatest sense of responsibility.\n\nYou also check your phone and see that Bobby\u2019s still trying to reach you, but you still don\u2019t feel like dealing with him. MAYBE later, right now you want to focus on one major decision at a time and moving out of a place where you\u2019ve lived your whole life certainly qualifies.\n\nAll your stuff is packed and ready to go, and since you can\u2019t do much more until your sister gets here, you just wait.\n\nAs you continue to wait, you start to get anxious.

You down there?\u201d you hear Donna call from upstairs.\n\u201cHuh? Uh what?! Yeah! Hold on!\u201d you exclaim and stop your stress relief session.\n\nAs you hurry to get dressed, Donna continues to call down to you.\n\n\u201cI called you know, why didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d\n\u201cUh, I guess I didn\u2019t hear it. Sorry about that. Be up in a minute.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were ready. What were you doing? Splittin\u2019 the kitten down there?\u201d Donna laughs. You don\u2019t answer; you just finish dressing and grab your bags.\n\nWhen you get upstairs, Donna greets you. She\u2019s wearing a shirt that is obviously trying to call attention to her small breasts and pants that are one size too tight to make her ass look like its more filled out, but she\u2019s dressed fairly conservative all things considered.\n\n\u201cWere you just taking what\u2019s in your bags? Because we could probably put more into the car.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I need to get out of here now. I mean maybe later I could get someone to come get my couch or some of my furniture though.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but really I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to, Julie\u2019s got spare beds and such. Plenty of space you know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\nYou and Donna leave the house and after throwing your bags in her car you and her are soon on your way.\n\nAlong the way Donna puts on some music. She takes mercy on you by not listening to that techno dance crap that you hate so much, but instead listens to the bubble gum pop crap that you hate slightly less.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026I found an area of the house where I think you\u2019ll be happiest at yesterday.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cOh? Is it the basement?\u201d\n\u201cHah, nah. That\u2019s being used for other things. I was thinking of Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s old office on the far left of the house. I mean Julie never uses it, and besides a few people wandering from the main party to have a quickie in there it\u2019s never used anymore.\u201d\n\u201cGee, you make it sound so appealing.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s either that or one of the upstairs bedrooms and I can\u2019t promise you won\u2019t be disturbed on regular basis there. At least with the office you can lock it and it\u2019s far enough away from the usual party grounds.\u201d\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s the best I can hope for, thanks I guess for thinking ahead.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. You know I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming to live with us. I mean I know you probably don\u2019t believe it, but I missed talking with you. Julie\u2019s fun and all, but even I get tired from partying ALL the time.\u201d\n\u201cWell thanks Donna\u2026hey this is like the twelfth police car I\u2019ve seen pulled over and cops arresting someone.\u201d You say looking out the window.\n\u201cYeah, I dunno if you\u2019ve noticed since you tend to hang out in the basement most of the time, but there\u2019s been an increase in crime which also means an increase in the cops using that as an excuse to be assholes\u2026 like this. Shit!\u201d\n\nNothing like talking something into existence. A cop car puts on its siren and a bullhorn tells you to pull over. You briefly worry that your sister isn\u2019t going to pull over, but she does. Swearing and sighing the whole time.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long before a policeman approaches the vehicle.\n\n\u201cAlright where are you going in such a hurry?\u201d the cop asks.\n\u201cNowhere. I wasn\u2019t even speeding!\u201d\n\u201cIs that right honey? Not according to my radar you weren\u2019t. Besides, you ignored a stop sign back there. I think you need to step out of the car.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? There wasn\u2019t a stop sign!\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to ask for her license and registration first?\u201d you add.\n\nThe cop suddenly points his finger at the both of you.\n\n\u201cThe both of you need to shut the hell up right, before I run you both in for obstruction of justice. Now both of you out of the car now!\u201d\n\nYour sister looks at you like she really wants to just try to turn the car back on and try to drive away, but you both know that wouldn\u2019t do any good save for getting yourselves in a whole lot of trouble.\n\nThe cop calls over his partner who looks equally uncompromising. He tells him to search you, while he starts searching the car while he puts Donna up against the car and starts patting down Donna.\n\n\u201cGetting a good feel, you bastard?\u201d Donna remarks.\n\nThe cop frisking you is slightly better, since you don\u2019t get your girl parts molested, but he certainly comes close. He snickers a bit as you tense up from this indignity.\n\nAfter you and your sister have been frisked. They tell you both to go sit on the curb with your hands locked behind your heads while they search the car.\n\nThis is a bad situation anyway since you\u2019re obviously dealing with two asshole cops, but who knows what the hell Donna\u2019s got in her car which will give them even more of an excuse to march you off to jail.\n\nSpeaking of which, Donna whispers to you.\n\n\u201cWe need to run.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask in a whisper.\n\u201cThose two fuckers are going to find something in the car.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re driving with illegal drugs in the car?\u201d\n\u201cNot that much, well at least I don\u2019t think I am\u2026hell I\u2019m not even sure, but I can\u2019t take that chance! We gotta run!\u201d\n\u201cAnd where the hell are we gonna go?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno! We could probably still hide at Julie\u2019s house.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right? That place is probably the first place they\u2019ll look! Shit, Donna! I knew I shouldn\u2019t have left the goddamn basement today!\u201d\n\u201cLook\u2026they\u2019re pretty involved in searching right now. If we ran we could probably at least lose them until we came up with a better idea.\u201d\n\nYou get the impression Donna is going to run no matter what and you can\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to be a good idea in any way. You\u2019re also concerned that if she runs and you stay, these two cops will just pin everything on you (whatever that may be).\n\nStill, if she sees that you\u2019re determined to stay, maybe she\u2019ll keep to her common sense and won\u2019t run too.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run", "result": "It\u2019s really not what you want to do, but if Donna does have drugs in her car like she thinks she does, it\u2019s going to be bad for you whether Donna runs or not.\n\nYou knew you shouldn\u2019t have left the basement!\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s do this, but I don\u2019t think we should run to Julie\u2019s house.

Got a friend by the name of Tina, she works over at the strip club.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Which one?\u201d\n\u201cKitty City, you know where it is?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell would I know where a strip club is?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re going to meet up there! If we run, we can\u2019t run in the same direction! We\u2019ll get caught for sure!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to get caught anyway!\u201d you say.\n\nYour voices start to catch the attention of the officers.\n\n\u201cHey! Quiet down the pair of you\u2026HEY! COME BACK HERE!\u201d one of the officers shouts as Donna runs off!\n\nYou\u2019re so surprised about her deciding that was the time to start running that you don\u2019t even get the opportunity to stand up from the curb before one officer is already chasing Donna and the other has already pulled out his pistol and commanded you to stay put.\n\nYou meekly put up your hands and lower your head in an attempt to show you have no intention of running.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Don\u2019t shoot.\u201d You say nervously.\n\nThe officer sees that you really aren\u2019t a threat puts his gun away, pulls you up roughly by the arm from the curb and throws you into the back of the police car before calling in on his radio about Donna being a runner.\n\nWhile you\u2019re breaking down in tears and worrying about the worst, the officer who threw you into the back of the police car finishes searching Donna\u2019s car. Eventually the other officer comes back as well looking a little worn out.\n\nAfter talking a moment, one of them opens the car door.\n\n\u201cAlright, I didn\u2019t find anything in the car, so why the hell did your friend run?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I really don\u2019t know\u2026officer\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking lie to me or this is going to go very badly for you!\u201d the cop warns and its enough to cause you to yelp a little in fear and begin to cry again.\n\n\u201c(sob) My sister\u2026thought you were going to\u2026(sob) find drugs in the car\u2026so she thought it would be better to run. Please I was just driving with her (sob) to find a new place to live! I\u2019ve never done anything (sob) wrong in my life! I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, shut the hell up and stop your crying. Shit. (Sigh) Well what do you think?\u201d the officer asks his partner who is still trying to catch his breath.\n\u201cDid you call in about the bitch running?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I dunno if anyone\u2019s going to bother chasing down some junkie whore, since it sounds like everyone\u2019s got their hands full especially now that a riot\u2019s broke out at the mall. In fact we\u2019re supposed to go down there and help.\u201d\n\u201cAnother fucking riot?! What the fuck is going on in this town? Someone put something in the water?\u201d\n\u201cSeems like it. So what do we do with this one? I mean she\u2019s clean and the car\u2019s clean so\u2026\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I dunno. I could think of a few things, but we probably don\u2019t have time for that right now.\u201d\n\nThe officer that chased Donna looks into the backseat at you. He\u2019s being as intimidating as possible and despite him being red in the face and winded it\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cAll right blondie, this is your lucky day. Due to the rest of this town seemingly losing its goddamn mind right now and the fact that you\u2019re clean, we\u2019re letting you go. You can take whatever belongings you have in the car, BUT we\u2019re still impounding it if only because your junkie sister made me fucking run several blocks trying to catch her ass.\u201d\n\u201cGot it. And thank you.\u201d You say and start to get out of the car.\n\nBoth of the officers help you out\u2026but it isn\u2019t out of kindness. The pair of them take the opportunity to grope your chest and your ass as you step out of the car.\n\n\u201cNow I suggest you gather your shit, and take your pretty little ass home.\u201d One of the cops says with a leering grin while other laughs.\n\nYou really aren\u2019t in any position to argue, fight or anything else. You hate the fact you just got molested, but you know that if you give them any sort of lip, they\u2019re going to do much worse.\n\nYou quickly get your bags out of Donna\u2019s car and run away from the scene without looking back. When you\u2019re far enough a way, you find some place to sit down and reflect on your situation.\n\nYou try to think of the positive first and that\u2019s namely things could\u2019ve been a lot worse you. You have no doubt that those cops would\u2019ve done more than just feel you up had they been in a less generous mood. So you\u2019re glad you didn\u2019t get jailed, raped or worse.\n\nBut then you think about the negative. First off is your sister who fucking LEFT you there. No hint, no \u201cNow!\u201d no clue at all that she was going to choose that particular time to run. Granted you froze up when it came time to run, but she didn\u2019t even look back. You don\u2019t exactly have the best opinion of her right now putting you in a situation like that.\n\nSecond of all you don\u2019t have a new place to live now or at least you aren\u2019t where you were going to go. As far as you know the offer to live at Julie\u2019s is still open, but it would quite the walk to go there now. A walk that you don\u2019t particularly want to do given the day you\u2019ve had, in fact you\u2019d rather just go back home.\n\nOf course the problem with going back home is you can\u2019t stay there so you\u2019re going to have to go someplace else eventually. Of course maybe Peter would let you borrow his car, but so far your track record with your siblings this weeks hasn\u2019t been great.", "action_results": [{"action": "Walk to Julie\u2019s house", "result": "You might as well continue to Julie\u2019s house. Going back home is just prolonging the inevitable. Also if your sister shows up at Julie\u2019s, you\u2019d like to give her a piece of your mind about her just ditching you like that.\n\nYour walk to Julie\u2019s slowly starts to become a worrisome endeavor. You see several fights along with a number of other officers arresting folks. You also see a couple of bad car accidents. While you try to avoid large groups of people, you\u2019re still in the danger zone of what almost seems like chaos on the streets. Those two asshole cops weren\u2019t joking when one of them said it seemed like the entire town had lost its mind.\n\nAs you quicken your pace to Julie\u2019s in an attempt to get through this madness quicker, a large teenager that\u2019s running from something runs right into you while he\u2019s turning a corner. The pair of you fall on the sidewalk.\n\nYou\u2019re a little dazed, but before you can even recover the teenager is upon you.\n\n\u201cYou stupid fucking bitch!

You feel several kicks going into your side and then your face. You plead for him to stop and curl up into a ball, but he\u2019s not even listening, it\u2019s like he\u2019s possessed or something because he actually starts laughing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that motherfucker!\u201d A voice shouts. You don\u2019t see who it is due to you being curled up and having your eyes closed wishing you were elsewhere, but you soon feel the weight of several someones stepping and falling all over you. The pursuers of your assailant have caught up to him and you are now unfortunately being crushed in the resulting dogpile.\n\nYou desperately attempt to crawl away feeling the pain of several fists, elbows, knees and feet randomly hitting you in the process. You just want to be home.\n\nYou manage to crawl out from under the pile and then scramble away as fast as you can only to stumble on your bruised wobbly legs in the middle of the street. It is then where your luck only gets worse when a speeding truck slams into your body which goes flying a few feet in front of the truck only THEN to be run completely over by the same truck which doesn\u2019t stop at all.\n\nYour misery is put to an end under the heavy weight of the truck\u2019s tires causing the innards from your mangled body to squeeze out like a tube of toothpaste and painting the street red.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Walk home", "result": "Really after the day you\u2019ve had so far, all you want to do is go home and hide out in your basement, so back home it is.\n\nYour walk home isn\u2019t entirely uneventful. You see several fights along with a number of other officers arresting folks. You also see a couple of bad car accidents. While you try to avoid large groups of people, you still are paranoid about someone to try to rob you or accost you in some way, but fortunately you manage to keep your head down and look as unassuming as possible.\n\nIt isn\u2019t quite chaos on the streets, but those two asshole cops weren\u2019t joking when one of them said it seemed like the entire town had lost its mind.\n\nBy the time you get back to your own neighborhood, it\u2019s starting to get dark, though your area is actually rather quiet compared to most places you passed through. You just hope Kelly isn\u2019t home because you don\u2019t really feel like dealing with her right now.\n\nWhen you get home, you see Peter\u2019s car in the driveway. Kelly\u2019s vehicle isn\u2019t here though, so it looks like you won\u2019t have to put up with her and that\u2019s at least one good thing that\u2019s happened to you today. (Besides the not getting raped part)\n\nUpon entering the house, it\u2019s in same condition as it was when you left, though now you\u2019re hearing a lot of grunting and sounds of ecstasy coming from the garage connected to the house. You imagine Peter is in the process of filming one of his shows again.\n\nNot wishing to hear your brother squeal like a pig as he gets fucked for the pleasure of his viewing Internet public, you waste no time in heading down into the basement and settling back into your usual routine in your room.\n\nYou know this isn\u2019t going to be permanent, but for now at least you can not worry about the pandemonium that\u2019s going on outside. You just wish the TV wasn\u2019t playing so many Ground Zero infomercials.\n\nHours pass as they do and just as you\u2019re getting ready to fall asleep, you suddenly get a phone call. It\u2019s Donna. You almost don\u2019t even bother answering, but you\u2019re curious to see if she\u2019s calling from jail and if she\u2019s delusional enough to think you\u2019ll actually bail her out.\n\n\u201cHey sis, where you at?!\u201d Donna asks. Sounds like music in the background so she must not be in jail.\n\u201cI\u2019m at home, no thanks to you just ditching me like that!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou said you were going to run, like I was! Didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, because by the time you took off without at least giving me a signal, one of those assholes was ready to shoot me. So I had to suffer through getting threatened, thrown in the back of a police car and groped a lot more severely than the first time they patted us down.\u201d\n\u201cOh geez\u2026they didn\u2019t...um\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t do that. Though I suspect if that had happened I wouldn\u2019t even be alive to talk to you right now. Your car didn\u2019t have any drugs in it by the way, but they have impounded it and I\u2019m pretty sure they still have you on a watchlist or something for evading arrest.\u201d\n\u201cShit. Figured something like that might happen.\u201d\n\u201cHm, Yeah and I\u2019m an idiot for nearly going along with your plan, but hey I guess everything went okay for you, I hear the party music in the back so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re whoring it up with Julie so I\u2019ll let you go so you can have your fun.\u201d\n\u201cHold on Suzy. First of all I\u2019m not at Julie\u2019s. I\u2019m at Kitty City like I said I would be. Second, I can\u2019t even get a hold of Julie. She\u2019s not answering her phone. Now of course she could just be busy, but if I got some sort of warrant out on me, then maybe going back there isn\u2019t the best idea right now. I\u2019m thinking maybe I should stay with my friend Tina instead. She\u2019s a stripper that\u2019s entertained at some of Julie\u2019s parties in the past. She\u2019s got room since she kicked her boyfriend out of her trailer.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh, well that\u2019s great for you. Glad to see you\u2019ve once again landed on your feet despite evading arrest. Goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, wai\u2026\u201d\n\nYou hang up. You half expect Donna to call again, but she doesn\u2019t which you\u2019re glad because you\u2019ve run out of patience with her for the day.\n\nYou settle down for the night and get some sleep, trying to put this horrible day behind you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "TUESDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026if you act now you\u2019ll get a free\u2026\u201d\n\nYou groggily grab the remote to shut off the incessant noise of the Ground Zero commercial on the TV screen.\n\nYou grab your phone to check the time and see that once again you\u2019ve slept through the morning as usual. You also see that Bobby tried to call you, but you\u2019re still not in the mood to call him back. Though if you don\u2019t secure a place to live you might not have a choice. Still as far as you know the offer to live at Julie\u2019s is still good, you\u2019re just not sure about how well that\u2019s going to go over now.\n\nWhile you\u2019re trying to ponder your next move, you get a call. It\u2019s Donna again. Might as well get this over with.\n\n\u201cDonna, this better be good, because you\u2019re not exactly my favorite person right now.\u201d You say answering the phone.\n\u201cWhoa! Hold on Suzy! Don\u2019t hang up!\u201d Donna exclaims.\n\u201cSay what you got to say.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, look first of all I\u2019m sorry about what you had to go through. I know that had to suck for you. I shouldn\u2019t have convinced you to run anyway. It\u2019s obvious now that was a stupid plan in the first place since I didn\u2019t even have anything in the car. (Sigh) Last night when I was sleeping on a beer soaked couch in a trailer hiding out from the cops I sort of had a revelation of how my choices in life had lead me to that point. I also sort of realized that if I probably continue on this path it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rather philosophical of your sister, and it\u2019s enough to keep your attention.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided that I need to do something with my life and make it better, so I got a job.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cA job? How the hell did you get a job so quick? Doing what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a stripper at Kitty City! The owner was offering me a job yesterday and I already was getting tips from guys who mistook me for one of the strippers here anyway. So I figured why not? In fact I\u2019m on break right now.\u201d\n\nWhy are you not surprised?\n\nDonna continues before you can even speak again.\n\n\u201cNow before you judge, starting a new life takes money and let\u2019s face it, I don\u2019t have exactly many useful skills that are going to earn me a lot of cash in a quick amount of time. I figure I can earn enough to save and figure things out as I go.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well that\u2019s great and all, but why are you telling me all this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBecause this is my new start and like I said I feel bad about convincing you to go along with my plan yesterday. Besides, don\u2019t you still need a place to stay? You can come live with me!\u201d\n\u201cI thought I was already going to do that by moving in to Julie\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m not going back to Julie\u2019s. Too much temptation to go back to my old ways there. I\u2019m moving into one of the trailers at the trailer park.\u201d\n\u201cWait. You just started working as a stripper. How the hell did you manage to get a trailer already?\u201d\n\u201cI secured one after\u2026um talking with the park owner this morning. Look, that\u2019s not really important right now. What is important is I got a deal on a fairly good one and it\u2019s big enough for two of us. It might be a little rough going at first, but I anticipate after a few weeks of teasing these degenerates here, we\u2019ll be living fairly comfortably, if not in the lap of luxury.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. While I\u2019m still pissed about yesterday, it does mean a lot that you\u2019re making this pretty generous offer. I don\u2019t know about living in a trailer park though. I mean aren\u2019t you worried about the kind of people there? In fact I can imagine a lot of the type that Kelly associates with come from there, do you really think its safe?\u201d\n\u201cSafe as opposed to what? Growing up in our household? We had a fucking paranoid psychotic older brother, a sadistic bullying older sister and at one point a goddamn SERIAL KILLER uncle living in our house. At least the hostile rednecks around here won\u2019t be living under our roof! Besides, it really isn\u2019t as bad as you hear.\u201d\n\nYou find that a little hard to believe considering you\u2019ve heard more than enough stories about the trailer park outside of town. Donna might not think its bad, just because she was living there overnight.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know Donna. I mean I wasn\u2019t exactly looking forward to dealing with the non-stop partying at Julie\u2019s, but I\u2019d at least feel a little safer there than I would at the trailer park.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, don\u2019t be so sure of that. Julie pretty much has gotten to the point where she has an open door policy to let any creepy weirdo that walks in off the street in the house. It\u2019s actually amazing someone like Uncle Ed hasn\u2019t come in and killed us all. Are you heading over there sometime today?\u201d\n\u201cWell if I can secure a ride over there I will.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well if you do get over there could you let Julie know that I\u2019m moving out? She\u2019s still not answering her phone. I\u2019m going to have to make arrangements to get my bigger things, but maybe you could help me get some of my smaller items when I get over there tonight?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose I could.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGreat. I knew I could count on your Suzy. (Sigh) You really are the good one in the family sis. It\u2019s so unfair that life hasn\u2019t been better to you. Once again I\u2019m really sorry about what happened yesterday. It\u2019s nearly time for me to go out there and shake my ass again so I gotta go. Just\u2026think about what I said okay? If you change your mind about your future living arrangements just come with Tina and me when we go over to Julie\u2019s tonight, or I guess if you\u2019re really feeling adventurous you could always go over to the trailer park yourself. Just go to the owner\u2019s trailer with the big signs around it and mention my name and he\u2019ll let you in my new place. He\u2019s sort of letch, but he\u2019s old so he mostly confines it staring and making the occasional comment. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nAfter another sincere apology about yesterday, Donna finally hangs up leaving you now with a new option.\n\nDonna seems to be genuinely trying to change her life in her own way. You almost can\u2019t believe it was Donna on the phone at all. Maybe some sort of pod person replaced her.\n\nShe also seems to be really making an effort to make things up to you, which is surprising as well. It\u2019s always a rarity in your family when you actually try to help each other out.\n\nStill, you\u2019re not sure about this whole living in a trailer park business for several reasons, but you suppose you could give it a little thought at least. In any case, you need to get a ride to wherever it is you\u2019re going to be heading to and that means seeing if your brother Peter is going to be just as accommodating as your sister currently is.\n\nYou head upstairs and knock on the door to the garage.\n\n\u201cHey, um Peter? You busy?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t get an answer right away, but eventually you do after more knocking.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, hold on!\u201d Peter says before answering the door. He\u2019s only peaking his head out, so it\u2019s very likely he\u2019s naked.\n\n\u201cUm, sorry to interrupt whatever it is you\u2019re doing, but I need a ride to my new place.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you moved out yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, there was a slight hiccup in the plan yesterday. Anyway, can you give me a ride over to my new place?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I\u2019m kinda in the middle of recording something. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to Julie\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I think.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou think? You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to live over at Julie\u2019s place or not?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026Donna got a new place of her own and I\u2019m still not sure if I should just move in with her yet.\u201d\n\u201cDonna got a new\u2026look you know what? I don\u2019t give a shit about any of this.\u201d Peter says and then closes the door.\n\nYou think that\u2019s the end of it, but he opens it up again, but this time only his hand with some keys in it are coming out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your personal taxi service. Here, take my car and return it tomorrow or at least by Thursday. Now don\u2019t disturb me again!\u201d\n\nYou take the keys and Peter slams the door. This is probably the most helpful he\u2019s been in\u2026well ever.\n\nYou go back and repack some of your bags and drag them to Peter\u2019s car. After loading everything up in the backseat you pull out of the drive way and wonder which way you should go.", "action_results": [{"action": "Drive to Julie\u2019s house", "result": "While you haven\u2019t quite ruled out the possibility of living with Donna, you don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite ready to go driving over there yourself and putting up with some old guy perving on you today. If you do decide to go over there, you\u2019ll do it later tonight.\n\nBesides, you want to see just how bad it might be over at Julie\u2019s before making a decision.\n\nA few minutes of driving to your destination and you\u2019re sure of one thing being pretty bad, the roads! Once again there are cops everywhere, but also ambulances and fire trucks racing to their various destinations too. You nearly turn around and head back home, but eventually you make it to Julie\u2019s neighborhood, which is thankfully not in the midst of anarchy.\n\nYou pull up to the driveway and get out of the car. You figure you\u2019ll assess the situation before making a decision of whether you\u2019re going to stay or not.\n\nYou sort of expected to see a few people drinking on the porch or at least hearing loud music as you walk up to the door, but so far it doesn\u2019t sound like any sort of party going on or at least not an overly rowdy one, which is odd considering how people have been acting in this town for the past few days.\n\nYou knock on the door, but get no immediate answer. After a few more bangs you finally get an answer, but it isn\u2019t Julie.\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d A man says in a flat tone and almost seems to be studying you. He looks like he might be around your age, but he doesn\u2019t look like the sort that would be at one of Julie\u2019s parties. He\u2019s very \u201cordinary\u201d looking.\n\u201cHey. Where\u2019s Julie at?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cJulie? Oh yes, the owner of this house. Well, I don\u2019t really know. I remember seeing her yesterday, but then she left with some guy and I haven\u2019t seen her since. Of course this being her house she has to return sometime right? Would you like to wait?\u201d the man asks opening the door further to invite you in.\n\nSomething about this guy feels a little \u201coff\u201d to you.\n\n\u201cWait, who are you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry for not introducing myself. I\u2019m Johnny. I was at Julie\u2019s party yesterday. Guess you could say I got a little tipsy and decided I shouldn\u2019t go home in that condition, so I flopped out in the basement. I\u2019m not the only person who did that apparently considering some of Julie\u2019s other guests are still here as well.\u201d\n\nYou peer inside and see that Johnny is indeed speaking the truth. A couple of people are on the couch playing some sort of video game.\n\n\u201cSo now that you know who I am, I have to ask who you are.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cI\u2019m Suzy and I\u2019m Julie\u2019s friend.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI see, well come on in, I\u2019m sure when Julie gets back she\u2019ll be pleased to see you.\u201d\n\nYou enter the house and the place is in a lot better condition than you would\u2019ve thought for a party house. Johnny quickly closes the door and locks it. Causing you to immediately look back.\n\n\u201cYou never can tell what weirdo will show up with unlocked doors and all, right?\u201d he says.\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d You say still getting an uneasy feeling about this guy.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re one of Julie\u2019s friends. Guess you\u2019re a real party girl, just like she is huh?\u201d Johnny remarks almost in an accusing fashion.\n\u201cHardly. Are these all the people in the house?\u201d you ask, pointing to the stoners playing video games and completely ignoring you and Johnny.\n\u201cYeah, I mean there were some other people here earlier, but these lot are all that\u2019s left, beside myself. Julie\u2019s pretty cool about letting people just crash here even if she\u2019s not around.\u201d\n\nWith Johnny creepily hovering near you and the stoners babbling about inane shit, you already realize that this is not going to work for you.\n\n\u201cAlright, everyone get out.\u201d You say, but the only one who even hears you is Johnny.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cLook I hate to be rude, and you probably didn\u2019t know this, but I\u2019m moving in here. Now when Julie is here, she can have all her little drug addled party friends over as much as she likes, I mean its her house after all. But I\u2019m not going to put up with them while she isn\u2019t here! So I want everyone out, you all can come back later when she\u2019s here. Whenever that is.\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s still the only one who is even paying attention and his facial expression on your stance hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s Julie\u2019s house doesn\u2019t she have final say in what goes?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cYeah, well when I see Julie, I\u2019m going to have a little discussion with her about our new living arrangements.\u201d You remark.\n\nOnce again Johnny just stares at you, it almost feels like he\u2019s staring through you. It makes you uncomfortable to say the least.\n\n\u201cAll right. You\u2019ve got a point. I wouldn\u2019t want a bunch of strangers just wandering around in my home either. I\u2019ll get out of your hair, as for these guys, I can get \u2018em to go.\u201d Johnny says and then suddenly shouts at the stoners that everyone has to get out of the house and starts ripping controllers out of their hands.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cNot cool dude!\u201d\n\u201cYou dick!\u201d\n\u201cSorry guys, but as the old saying goes, you don\u2019t have to go home, but you can\u2019t stay here. Come on, let\u2019s move it.\u201d Johnny says and eventually the stoners grudgingly shuffle off to leave. Johnny follows behind them.\n\n\u201cWhen you see Julie, tell her it was an excellent party last night.\u201d Johnny says and flashes a brief smile, which comes off more creepy than friendly. You don\u2019t even reply, you just shut the door and lock it, glad to be rid of everyone.\n\nRemembering that your sister said that if you did live here, you\u2019d be sleeping in Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s old office. You explore that room first. When you get there it looks pretty much like the same office you remember being in a few times when you played over here. It\u2019s definitely convenient that it has a small private bathroom leading from it as well as a couch that apparently folds out into a bed.\n\nAfter assessing your possible new digs, you decide to go retrieve your bags from the car. You unpack your bags and haul them into the house and head on into your new room.\n\nAfter getting a little bit settled, you figure since you\u2019re all alone in the house, you might as well do something that usually puts you in a better mood. (and you sure could use it)\n\nWhile you\u2019re in the middle of it, you suddenly think you hear something. You call out thinking that maybe Julie is finally home, but when you get no reply, you just check to make sure the door to your room is locked. If Julie does come home, you don\u2019t want her suddenly walking in on you.\n\nAfter getting back in the mood and taking care of your needs you wash up a bit and return to your usual routine of\u2026well doing nothing at all.\n\nHours pass and eventually you start to get hungry so you head to the kitchen in the hopes of finding food. You manage to find a few bags of junk food and some unopened drink in the fridge. Once again while you\u2019re doing this, you swear you think you hear noise. You call out again to see if anyone is here, but there is no answer.\n\nGiven that it\u2019s now nighttime you\u2019re a little on edge. You know its probably just the house making creaking sounds, but with all the bullshit that\u2019s been going on out in the streets lately you\u2019re just a little paranoid.\n\nJust as you\u2019re heading back to your room, the front door suddenly opens! It\u2019s Donna and some other young woman who looks a bit on the trashy side.\n\n\u201cShit! You scared me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pick up your phone? I tried calling you before I got over here.\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cI\u2026I guess I had it on vibrate and didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm. Well I see this place is practically a tomb. I take it Julie isn\u2019t home?\u201d\n\u201cNope, I haven\u2019t heard from her either.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s really odd\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly the trashy young woman speaks up.\n\n\u201cHey Donna are we picking your shit up or what? You know how fucked up it is out there right now and I\u2019d like to get home before it gets worse.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, better get to it. Suzy, this is my friend Tina.\u201d Donna says and heads upstairs.\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d You say to Tina, but she just grunts at you and heads back outside to her car.\n\nRemembering that Donna wanted you to help her move some of the stuff, you head upstairs to her room.\n\n\u201cYour friend Tina isn\u2019t very friendly.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cYeah, well if you were a horny guy with a hundred dollar bill, she\u2019d be really friendly towards you. Anyway, she\u2019s always been cool with me ever since I\u2019ve known her, plus she helped me get the current job I have.\u201d Donna says as she packs away items.\n\u201cYou need anything for me to carry down?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but not yet. Really I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll get most of this stuff later when I have a day off. Right now I just want to get the hell out of this town, it\u2019s getting nuts out there!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was pretty chaotic out there earlier on my drive here. So how was your first day?\u201d\n\u201cNot bad. As strange as it may seem, it actually was calmer in the club than it was outside. Though having bouncers helps in that area I suppose. Still a couple of fights did break out.\u201d\n\u201cShit. You okay? Are you sure the job is safe?\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m safe. Like I said, there\u2019s good protection there. Honestly I\u2019m more concerned with the drive TO the club, but I imagine whatever is going on will die down eventually.\u201d\n\u201cHope so.\u201d\n\nDonna finishes packing a bag and starts to pack a new one and you stand there silent until you hear a noise from downstairs causing you to jump a bit.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cYeah, what the hell\u2019s that noise?\u201d you ask, briefly stepping out of Donna\u2019s room to look over into the living room.\n\u201cProbably Tina.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s not down there and besides she went back to wait in the car.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe she wandered back in briefly\u2026you seem a little stressed.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. The shit\u2019s that\u2019s been going on in town and I guess being alone in the house at night has got me a little jumpy. Sort of concerned that Julie hasn\u2019t come back either.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, well that IS odd. I tried calling her again earlier too with no luck. Have you thought anymore about coming to live with me? I told you it would be fine and I know you think the trailer park isn\u2019t safe environment, is this town really any safer right now?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Donna", "result": "While you\u2019re still not entirely sure about the trailer park, you have to admit the since you\u2019ve been here in the house you\u2019ve felt a little nervous at times. Almost like you feel someone is watching you. Silly of course, but maybe leaving town is a good idea if it\u2019s getting as chaotic as it has been.\n\nYou just hope you\u2019re making the right decision.\n\n\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou will? Great! Seriously, things will be better between us. I\u2019m still really sorry about yesterday Suzy, here.\u201d Donna says and hands you a bunch of money.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s some of what I made today. Oh don\u2019t worry, I still got a lot. I\u2019m telling you with the money I\u2019m making, we might even be able to find some place better to live in a few months! Okay, well I think I\u2019m all packed, go grab your stuff and meet me in Tina\u2019s car. Oh wait, I saw Peter\u2019s car out there. Are you going to follow us in that instead?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so, it will probably be less cramped.\u201d You say and head downstairs to your room while Donna follows and heads out the door.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really take you long to throw your stuff in your bags since you didn\u2019t really unpack that much. Just as you\u2019re loaded up, you once again feel like you\u2019re being watched. You spin around and see nothing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving yourself the creeps Suzy. Nobody\u2019s here.\u201d You mumble.\n\nJust as you are exiting your room, it\u2019s a minor miracle that Donna comes back in through the front door.\n\n\u201cWHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?\u201d you hear her scream from the living room. This causes you to pause just long enough that the assailant who was going to ambush you when you left your room losses his advantage.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s still intent on killing you though and nearly succeeds in grabbing you, but you manage to back away in time.\n\nAs you back away you get a good look at him now and he\u2019s not unfamiliar to you. It\u2019s Johnny, but this time his face displays an utter hatred towards you.\n\n\u201cFucking whore! You think you could get away? I heard what you did in here earlier! I got something I can shove up in there to make you feel like you\u2019ve never felt before and never will again!\u201d Johnny screams and swing his knife at you.\n\nYou continue to back away, but there isn\u2019t much room so you go around the desk for temporary relief, but even if you make it into the bathroom and lock the door you\u2019ll just be trapped in there.\n\nYou\u2019re so busy trying to survive, you completely forget that Donna is still in the house, but you soon remember when she runs in the room and clobbers Johnny in the back of the head with a small lamp.\n\n\u201cFuck\u2026shit\u2026\u201d Johnny says crumpling to the floor. He\u2019s not dead, but Donna\u2019s too busy calling to you to run to finish him off.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Come on! Get out of there!\u201d Donna shouts and you waste no time in doing so.\n\nJust as Johnny struggles to get back up, Donna throws the lamp at his head and follows you.\n\nIn all the excitement you forgot if you have Peter\u2019s keys, but Donna just shouts at you to get into Tina\u2019s car as you exit the house.\n\nAs you both pile into the car, Tina is more than a little surprised.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you two\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust drive! Drive! Drive!\u201d Donna shouts.\n\nYou\u2019re squashed a bit in the backseat with all the bags and panting heavily, but you\u2019re glad you got out of there. Thought you\u2019re understandably still shaken up.\n\n\u201cWe need to tell the cops!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cTell them what? Have you seen this town Suzy? You think we\u2019re going to get any help? Shit, I probably still got a warrant out on me!\u201d Donna says.\n\nMeanwhile Tina is getting annoyed about being out of the loop.\n\n\u201cWill one of you bitches tell me what the fuck is going on?! I mean this is my car and I\u2019d like to know if we\u2019re planning on getting shot at!\u201d Tina snaps.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Well not fine, but nobody\u2019s shooting at anyone. Some nut case with a knife was in the house and tried to kill my sister.\u201d Donna replies.\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean maybe. Shit, I dunno. I smacked him in the head twice with a lamp, but I don\u2019t think I killed him.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201c(Sigh) You should\u2019ve finished him off. I would have.\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cTina, I\u2019m not in the mood right now okay?!\u201d Donna shouts.\n\u201cFine. Fine. I\u2019m just saying you better watch yourself in the future. Anyway, I need to focus on getting us through this bullshit going on in town, because we could still be getting shot at.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the drive is in relative silence, broken up periodically by Tina swearing at the road situation and your sister asking if you\u2019re okay since you\u2019re so quiet.\n\nYour quietness is due to still being shaken up by what just occurred and also because you just don\u2019t have anything to say at the moment and are just hoping you get to where you have to get to in peace and in one piece.\n\nAfter a long drive, you eventually reach the trailer park. You look out the window at the various rundown trailers in the darkness and think \u201cSo this is what my life has come to.\u201d\n\nFinally you stop at one towards the further end of the park close to undeveloped land and just regular wilderness. One thing you sort of were expecting was the drunken revelry of several hillbillies, and while you did see a few sitting around with some bottles in hand, it\u2019s actually pretty quiet.\n\n\u201cThis is your place right Donna?\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cYeah, thanks Tina.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well just be ready to go in the afternoon tomorrow. I\u2019m not waiting around for you.\u201d Tina replies.\n\nAs the pair of you get out and unload your bags from the car, Tina studies you a bit.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know blondie, you\u2019re not bad lookin\u2019. If you ever loosen up a bit, you could easily get a job at Kitty City too. I think the school girl look would work for ya pretty well. You kinda got that innocent look.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t think so.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, suit yerself. I\u2019m just tryin\u2019 to help YOU out. Whatever.\u201d Tina remarks and backs the car up and swings it around to head back to her own trailer.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t like her.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, well I\u2019m not surprised. Come on, let\u2019s get inside. I\u2019ll give you the grand tour.\u201d\n\nNaturally being a trailer, the \u201cgrand tour\u201d doesn\u2019t take long. Donna tried to make the place sound better than it is, but it\u2019s better than you thought it would be, so it\u2019s not awful. She points out the couch which will have to do for your sleeping accommodations.\n\n\u201cWell Suzy, I know this is kind of a weird way to end the night given all that went down, but I\u2019m really tired and I need to get some sleep, but before I do, did you need to talk about what happened?\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cProbably, but what good would it really do? I mean I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m a magnet for serial killers at this point. Uncle Ed, my ex, this asshole we just barely got away from\u2026Oh shit! Julie!\u201d you suddenly say thinking about the grim implications of what might\u2019ve happened to her.\n\nDonna\u2019s face drops a bit too.\n\n\u201cFuck. You said you haven\u2019t been able to get a hold of her at all?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cNo. Shit, that sick fuck probably killed her!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cNow we don\u2019t know for certain. She could be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI KNOW for certain. That creepy fucker told me a story involving her leaving the house when I met him earlier today. He probably lied and actually killed her. Oh fuck this is bad. I mean I know I grew apart from Julie\u2026but goddamn it\u2026\u201d you say getting a little teary eyed.\n\nDonna tries to console you, but she\u2019s starting to get upset too. Really you haven\u2019t seen her get sad for quite some time. Your sadness over the very likely loss of your friend is almost like a bonding experience. In between the tears you thank Donna for saving your life.\n\n\u201c(Sniffle) Hey, you might\u2019ve saved mine had you not called me to move out in the first place. I mean without you, I might\u2019ve been very partying with that sicko and he could\u2019ve killed me as well as Julie. (deep breath) Okay, tomorrow you come with me. I\u2019ll try to convince Tina to drop you off at the police station. Hopefully you can make a report or something and we can at least get those corrupt fucks to look into it. Assuming things have settled down in town that is.\u201d\n\u201cThings have been really fucked up lately.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I dunno Suzy. I don\u2019t place much stock in end times bullshit, but I guess those Ground Zero commercials they\u2019re constantly blasting on the radio is starting to make me think something big is going to go down, though maybe it is already.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like it with the way my luck is going.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry sis. We\u2019re going to get through this, no matter what comes our way. You and me. This is a brand new start for us, remember?\u201d\n\nThis uncommon optimism does make you smile a bit at the fact you don\u2019t have to deal with all this yourself.\n\n\u201cOkay, Donna. (Yawn) I guess I better get some sleep. It\u2019ll be a big day if I\u2019m to make a report tomorrow. Thanks again for saving me, I\u2019m never going to forget it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, like I said, you probably saved mine as well. Good night Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cNight Donna.\u201d\n\nDonna heads off to her bed and you eventually fall asleep on the couch.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026act now and spend your life in the comfort of\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shut the hell up\u2026I already know the world is going to hell in a hand basket.\u201d You hear Donna say while she turns off the TV as you groggily wake up from the couch.\n\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s past noon that\u2019s for sure. Still a few hours to go before we have to get ready to leave.\u201d\n\u201cOh. How long you been awake?\u201d\n\u201cHm, not long. The shower\u2019s all yours though, I\u2019ve already used it.\u201d\n\nYou sit up still getting used to your new surroundings\n\n\u201cHm, you were right, it really isn\u2019t what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting to hear the sounds of drunken hillbillies arguing and shooting off guns when I woke up. It\u2019s actually pretty quiet.\u201d You say gathering so clean clothes.\n\u201cHeh, well I can\u2019t say that probably won\u2019t happen around the holidays, but like I said, I think you\u2019ll find that even the trashiest of people aren\u2019t acting like stereotypes all the time.\u201d Donna replies.\n\nYou nod and head off to take a shower. While you wash up, you try to mentally prepare yourself for your trip to the police station today. Part of that involves relaxing yourself and relieving yourself of tension in the usual way that hasn\u2019t failed you yet\u2026\n\nA few minutes later\u2026\n\n\u201cSUZY! SUZY! GET DRESSED WE GOT A FUCKING SITUATION OUT HERE!\u201d you suddenly hear Donna say as she beats on the bathroom door.\n\nAs startling as that is, what you hear next is even more so due to a loud bullhorn.\n\n\u201cTHIS IS THE NATIONAL GUARD. THIS AREA IS NOW UNDER MARTIAL LAW! ALL INHABITANTS WILL EXIT THEIR TRAILERS AND AMASS IN THE CENTER FOR OBSERVATION! ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO RUN OR RESISTING WILL BE SHOT!\u201d\n\nSo much for putting your mind at ease.\n\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I hear what\u2019s going on! I\u2019m getting out!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cHurry!\u201d Donna says.\n\nYou stop your shower, grab your clean clothes and start getting dressed as quickly as possible.\n\nTina is looking out one of the windows when you exit the bathroom.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of military trucks with a bunch of guardsmen out there. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but this is really bad. Shit. This has gotta have something to do with what\u2019s been going on in town.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cThey want us to go out there too.\u201d You say not being enthusiastic about that idea.\n\u201cYeah, fuck that. It\u2019s probably just so they can kill us easier if we\u2019re all huddled up in a group or worse, maybe they want to round us up in those trucks for some sinister purpose.\u201d\n\nOdd that Donna always thought your older brother was a kook for talking like that on regular basis, but she sounds more like him than ever right now. To be fair though, this is all pretty strange and you\u2019re not exactly trusting of the situation yourself.\n\n\u201cWell what are other people doing?\u201d\n\u201cSome are coming out and some are staying in. In fact more are staying in than coming out, but that\u2019s hardly surprising. The folks around here aren\u2019t exactly fond of the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cEVERYONE OUT OF THEIR TRAILERS NOW! THIS IS NOT A CHOICE, IT\u2019S A FUCKING ORDER!\u201d\n\nYou and Donna look at each other.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to end well. Maybe we should run.\u201d Donna suggests and you nearly laugh.\n\u201cYeah, because the plan to run worked SO well for me last time!\u201d you say.\n\u201cOkay this is different, we really would be running off together. Come on, do you really think those soldiers out there are any better than those cops that pulled us over? In fact they sound worse!\u201d\n\u201cWell you got a point there, (sigh) okay so what\u2019s the plan? We just step out the trailer and run? They already said they\u2019re going to open fire on anyone who does that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re lucky since we have a trailer at the end of the park. We could probably make a run for it and hide in the wilderness behind the park.\u201d\n\u201cThat simple huh? How long are we supposed to hide out there? I don\u2019t know how to survive in the wild and unless you been secretly reading up such things, I don\u2019t think you do either.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t fucking know! I\u2019m just trying to come up with suggestions here! Fuck Suzy, I\u2019m trying to help YOU out as usual.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. Thanks for that Donna. Real helpful right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEVERYONE EXIT THEIR TRAILERS RIGHT FUCKING NOW! THIS IS YOUR LAST FUCKING WARNING OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE AND THESE RUN DOWN PIECES OF SHIT WILL BE YOUR GODDAMN COFFINS!\u201d\n\nYou look out the window briefly and see the few people that have exited their trailers are being shoved roughly in the center of the park. Some of the guardsmen stand nearby pointing their rifles at them, but nothing more yet.\n\nA few more of the guardsmen are starting to spread out and move about the park. It looks like they\u2019re preparing for combat.\n\nAnd then suddenly you see one of the locals kick their door open and yell something at the top of their lungs while blasting one of the soldiers with a shotgun before getting riddled with bullets.\n\nThen all hell breaks loose.\n\n\u201cGet down!\u201d you shout and you and Donna are both getting as low as you can on the floor. Gunfire, shouting and screaming is all you can hear and you\u2019re praying that a stray doesn\u2019t go through the wall and hit you.\n\nDonna apparently has the same idea.\n\n\u201cSuzy, we gotta get the fuck outta here!\u201d\n\u201cDonna we go out that front door and we risk an even bigger chance of getting our asses shot off!

Come on out you goddamn redneck! Got your bitch here or is it also your sister? Fuckin\u2019 inbreds!\u201d\n\nYou hear Donna continue to plead and exclaim she lives alone and that she has no weapons of any kind. The guardsmen doesn\u2019t sound completely convinced and you hear him pushing Donna and exclaiming for her to head towards the bedroom swearing the whole time about his shitty assignment, you know its only a matter of time before he discovers that you\u2019re here.\n\nYou hastily look around the bathroom, but there isn\u2019t much here in the way of weapons except a can of your sister\u2019s hairspray. Maybe you can blind him, though you\u2019d need to time it just right.\n\nTaking a deep breath, you get near the entryway of the door prepare the can\u2026\n\nYour sister passes by and sees you out the corner of her eye, but makes no indication that she\u2019s seen you.\n\n\u201cJust keep going. If there really is nobody in the bedroom, then we\u2019re just going to hide out in the back for a while and then\u2026ARGH! SHIT!\u201d the soldier exclaims as you unload the hairspray in his eyes as he starts to pass the bathroom entrance.\n\nFortunately he drops his rifle in the process of his sudden blindness, which you quickly snatch up. Donna is still scrambling to get up and get out of the way, meanwhile the blind soldier is backing up trying to fish his pistol out of his holster.\n\n\u201cFucking\u2026shit\u2026I\u2019m gonna kill all of you inbred trash! I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t wait around for him to possibly carry out his threats; you don\u2019t think about it, you just shoot. The rifle kicks a bit and you hurt yourself in the process, but your assailant with several new holes in him is in even worse condition. He drops his pistol and slumps backwards in a bloody heap.\n\nFor a moment you just stand there in disbelief on what you\u2019ve done. You just killed a man. Even if it was life and death, you still killed someone.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Get down, they\u2019re still shooting out there!\u201d Donna shouts from the bedroom entrance.\n\nYou get down on the floor still clutching on to your killing tool and crawl to the bedroom. You feel a bit weird, but not sick.\n\nYou and your sister hide behind her bed, huddled close to each other as the shooting and general mayhem out there continues for what seems like a very long time, but in reality it\u2019s only about fifteen-twenty minutes.\n\nAs the gunshots die down, you can hear the victory hooting and hollering outside which is then followed by more gunshots probably fired in victory.\n\nFor a moment you and your sister stay down for a little while longer, but eventually the pair of you get up. You just sit on the edge of the bed trying to wrap your head around everything that just happened.\n\nDonna on the other hand peeks out one of the windows.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess our side won.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cNot sure if that\u2019s going to be a good thing in the long run.\u201d You say.\n\nDonna doesn\u2019t pay much attention to your statement, but instead heads to the main room of the trailer. After a few moments, you gather your strength and follow her.\n\nShe looks at the dead soldier on the floor and you do as well.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s true what they say, you never know if you can kill someone or not until you have to.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cOr want to.\u201d You add.\n\u201cWell anyway I\u2019m glad you did. Shit, that was fucking intense. The weird thing is how well worked together in the situation I mean I lured him to the back and you ambushed him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I suppose we already had several run-throughs of dealing with hostile assholes this week. We were bound to get it right eventually.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cHeh, I suppose so\u2026well no point in letting this asshole stink up the place, let\u2019s drag him outside.\u201d\n\nDonna gets his legs and you get his upper body and drag the soldier out of the trailer. As you do so, you notice his rank is that of a high-ranking NCO. You wonder if he was the one in charge of this detachment.\n\nWhen you get him outside, Tina is just walking up with a scruffy looking man wearing a cap and clothing that doesn\u2019t look like its been washed in days. He carries a shotgun over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWell fuck Donna. Did you actually kill one of those fuckers?\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cNot me, my sister did.

Maybe you\u2019re not the innocent wallflower I thought you were.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take any pleasure in it, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d You say defensively.\n\n\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. You saw a threat to your family and home and you took care of business. It\u2019s what any right thinking American SHOULD do when the fucking government tries to impose its will on folks. They tried to do it here, well they didn\u2019t fucking succeed. We showed them that, but I reckon there\u2019s gonna be a lot more trouble comin\u2019. Believe it.\u201d The man suddenly says.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you ask almost in an accusing tone.\n\nMel doesn\u2019t really look offended, but Tina speaks up before he can.\n\n\u201cThis is Mel, my\u2026significant other.\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cSignificant other? What the fuck are we fucking faggots? Life partners and all that shit? Just say I\u2019m your goddamn boyfriend. Shit, I\u2019m practically your husband with as long as we\u2019ve been together.\u201d\n\u201cI hesitated to call you my boyfriend because I don\u2019t know where we exactly stand right now and until you buy me a fucking ring and propose, you\u2019re definitely NOT my husband!\u201d\n\u201cPftt, I told ya, I see no reason for a piece of paper handed out by some bean counter to tell me how I feel about ya, let alone some piece of jewelry. Besides, we fight all the fucking time and always get back together, so stop bein\u2019 a fuckin\u2019 drama queen.\u201d\n\nAt this point Tina and Mel start to argue and not wishing to get in the middle of it, you and Donna start to walk back to your trailer. When you get inside Donna starts finding bags and begins putting away clothes.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like? I\u2019m packing up my shit and getting ready to get the hell outta here. It\u2019s apparent that you were right again, about this place. It\u2019s not safe here.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t think its too safe anywhere. At least the immediate threat here has been eliminated.\u201d You say.\n\nDonna stops packing.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. Are you serious? This can\u2019t be happening. I mean YOU of all people. Are you seriously considering staying here?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean would I like there to be a better option? Yes! But what options do we really have Donna? We don\u2019t even have a fucking car to leave in and I doubt very seriously anyone is going to let us borrow a vehicle now. We\u2019re going to be on foot, heading to god knows where. I mean WHERE are we going to go? Back to town? With all the bullshit going on there? Into that wilderness where we can slowly starve to death due to our lack of survival knowledge? Further down the road where we\u2019ll run into who knows what? I mean everything seems so chaotic right now and I want at least a stable chance of survival. Your plan has always been to run and so far it hasn\u2019t worked out very well either for me or you. Maybe we need to dig our heels in and tough it out if only for a bit.\u201d\n\nDonna sits down on the couch processing your words. She probably can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even thinking this way, and to be honest you can\u2019t either. Maybe killing another human changed something within you and you\u2019re not willing to just sit around and be a victim anymore. You\u2019re going to DO something to improve your situation. Anything.\n\n\u201cOkay, I get what you\u2019re saying. And yeah you\u2019re right that it\u2019s going to suck walking to wherever our unknown destination is going to be and we don\u2019t know where we would go, but I\u2019m just saying it HAS to be safer than staying here. I mean if we do stick around, what if the government sends another group of soldiers here? It\u2019s going to look mighty suspicious that the last group they sent isn\u2019t here and will probably be really bad for us. If we leave, we can at least distance ourselves from this mess. I dunno, I mean at this point I\u2019ll stick with you no matter what you decide, I just think we oughta get the fuck outta here.\u201d Donna advises.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the trailer park", "result": "It isn\u2019t going to be pleasant to leave, but Donna does make a good point about the foolishness of sticking around here after the massacre of military personnel.\n\n\u201cOkay Donna, I guess maybe you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll pack and we\u2019ll head out.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe it won\u2019t be completely hopeless. Maybe some of the others here will be leaving too, we might be able to go with them or catch a ride for awhile at least.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I don\u2019t hold out too much hope, but I\u2019ll let you take care of that, just let me know when you\u2019re ready to go, because I\u2019m going to have to figure out what I need and can take with me without collapsing from exhaustion.\u201d\n\nWhile you struggle with what clothing you can do without and what items you\u2019re going to need, Donna finishes packing and leaves the trailer to presumably go charm a ride from someone.\n\nA half hour passes and Donna returns just as you\u2019re finishing up packing and she doesn\u2019t look in the best of spirits.\n\n\u201cI take it, it didn\u2019t go well?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe at least ONE of these rednecks isn\u2019t so damn stupid to want to stay here! But no, everyone of these dumb fuckers are insisting on sticking around trying to make this place into a fortress or some shit.\u201d\n\u201cNot one fell for your charms?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cWell I figured you were offering something in return\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u201cOffer?...Oh yuck! Suzy! Seriously? Do you think I\u2019m just that much of a whore?!\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cWell I mean I know you\u2019re free spirited enough not to give a shit about that sort of thing. I mean that IS how you got this trailer up front isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first that was different. Second that was REALLY unpleasant! Anyway, looks like we\u2019re walking. Even Tina wasn\u2019t willing to help out.\u201d\n\u201cHardly surprising. So which direction are we walking?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? There\u2019s only one way to go. I mean you aren\u2019t suggesting we head back to town do you?\u201d\n\u201cWell the other direction will eventually lead to Security City and I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be any better there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s still a very long way off Suzy, I mean maybe we can find refuge somewhere else first, like a truck stop or something.\u201d\n\u201cI just hope we aren\u2019t rounded up by passing military on the road. Oh well I guess we\u2019ll find out. At least we got a couple weapons from that asshole who tried to kill us earlier.\u201d You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you and Donna leave the trailer, which was once to be your new home and make your way out of the park. Seems like ever since you left home, you\u2019re doomed to not stay anywhere for very long. You hope this isn\u2019t a sign of things to come.\n\nAs you leave, you see that Donna was right in that the park residents are indeed trying to barricade this place up by putting vehicles in strategic locations. You don\u2019t see how such a plan can possibly stand up against a real attack by the military, but they\u2019re determined not to be run off.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re leaving Donna?\u201d Tina asks on your way out.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think this place is for me and my sister. You sure that you want to still stay here?\u201d\n\u201cNo point in doing so yet. Besides, Mel is actually getting everyone\u2019s ass in gear to prepare this place for more potential trouble. It\u2019s the most motivated I\u2019ve seen him in\u2026well since he first sweet talked me into spreading my legs for him and that was ages ago. Really I dunno why y\u2019all are leaving. It\u2019s only going to be worse out there, but suit yerselves. Good luck I guess.\u201d Tina says and leaves the pair of you.\n\nLeaving the trailer park behind, night has already begun to fall as you walk along side the road.\n\nTen minutes in and Donna breaks up the silence.\n\n\u201cThe road is pretty deserted. There hasn\u2019t been any traffic in either direction since we started walking.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cHopefully it stays like that, seems like every time more people show up more problems crop up.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYeah, I guess it does seem that way. Bet you\u2019re wishing you were in the basement right now.\u201d\n\u201cGot that right. No use wishing it was so though. Those carefree days are long gone now.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, as are my own carefree days of partying everyday. A few days ago I was just starting to think that maybe I had been wasting my life and needed it to get back on track to do something productive. Now? Looks like I didn\u2019t waste anything seeing as the world appears to be going to shit.\u201d Donna adds.\n\nYou agree and the pair of you continue walking. The stars are a lot brighter without the streetlights of the town around. You look up at them on several occasions never really admiring the \u201cheavens\u201d before. You get the impression even Donna is starting to admire them. Really until this walk, you\u2019ve never really realized just how rural of an area you lived in before.\n\nHours pass and both of you are tired, not just from the walking though, it was an \u201caction packed\u201d day earlier for the pair of you after all. In the far distance though you see the shape of what looks to be several structures.\n\n\u201cHey Donna, looks like something is up ahead. It\u2019s really dark, but I think those are tents or something.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, wonder what that is.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cMaybe we should hang back until morning.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause who knows who the hell is over there. I mean maybe that\u2019s a military encampment. We go walking in, and soldiers could suddenly surround us. Or worse, they see us stumbling in the darkness and shoot us on sight believing we\u2019re intruders. Both of us are pretty tired anyway, I think it would be best if we approached this with clear eyes and in the daytime.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, okay you might be right about that. Where are we sleeping though?\u201d\n\u201cLooks like the great outdoors. Come on let\u2019s get off the side of the road. We don\u2019t need someone running us over in our sleep.\n\nYou and Donna head off the road and deeper into wilderness, though not too much. You try to find a spot that seems \u201cgood\u201d and then you realize you\u2019re in the damn wilderness without even a sleeping bag, there is no where to sleep that\u2019s going to be \u201cgood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I guess here will do. Use your back pack as a pillow and try to get comfy.\u201d You say laying down.\n\u201cUgh, I can only imagine the things that are going to be crawling on me in the night.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cYeah, things suck all over. Hey why are you getting so close?\u201d\n\u201cYou got both weapons! I\u2019m not sleeping too far from you. Besides, it\u2019s fucking cold out here. We\u2019ll stay warmer if we sleep near each other. Did that with Julie once when her heating system was broken for a week.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well you better not start cuddling or worse grinding on me.\u201d\n\u201cGeez Suzy, that\u2019s sick! You\u2019re my sister for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cGood, glad we understand each other.\u201d\n\nAs you attempt to get as comfortable as possible Donna keeps moving so she\u2019s partially touching you, despite the fact you\u2019re trying to keep apart. Eventually you give up and just try to focus on sleeping.\n\n\u201cSuzy?\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we left and are seeing this through together.\u201d Donna says in such a way that you haven\u2019t heard her speak before. Almost like a little kid.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re seeing this through together too.\u201d You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you drift off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\n\u201cSUZY! WAKE UP! GET UP NOW!\u201d you hear Donna scream followed by her pulling and shaking you.\n\u201cWha\u2026the fuck?!\u201d you utter completely confused. You\u2019re even more confused when Donna grabs the rifle near you and fires it, succeeding in smashing her shoulder due to being unprepared by the kick back and not holding it right in the first place. She cries out an obscenity and drops the rifle.\n\nWhile you still aren\u2019t completely sure of what\u2019s going on, you do look in the direction that Donna was firing and see what she was firing at.\n\nSeveral people are loping in your direction snarling and generally making unpleasant sounds. You don\u2019t know who they are or what\u2019s wrong with them, but you follow Donna\u2019s lead and pull your pistol to fire at them.\n\nYou aren\u2019t exactly the best shot in the world, but after a couple shots you clearly hit the closest one in the chest, who stops temporarily, but then recovers until you hit him again, at which point he falls. It doesn\u2019t deter any of the others though and they just continue to run at you.\n\nMeanwhile Donna gets off another shot, but misses wildly. Seeing their numbers and knowing you don\u2019t have the skill or the ammo to deal with these obviously insane people, you tell Donna you and her need to run and you don\u2019t need to do it twice.\n\nYou and Donna run towards the group of tents still in the distance. You still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a military encampment or what, but the key thing is it\u2019s in the opposite direction of those things chasing you.\n\nYou\u2019re about half way towards your destination and your sister becomes a horror movie clich\u00e9 by falling behind and then tripping and falling on her face.\n\n\u201cSuzy!\u201d you hear her scream and you turn around to see several of those things almost on her.\n\nYou run back and shoot a couple of them, but by the time you grab her hand to help her up, one of them manages to grab her and bite her shoulder.\n\nDonna screams pierce your ears and you blast the thing in the head splattering its blood on you and Donna. The two that you shot (but failed to obviously kill) at this point have recovered and are already attacking you and Donna.\n\nYou\u2019re tackled to the ground and you just barely manage to keep the thing from biting you by putting your forearm against its throat as it desperately tries to bite your face off. You get a good look at the thing at this range, while its dirty, crazed and making the animalistic growling noises, it looks completely human. Rabies perhaps?\n\nIn any case you manage to get your pistol arm free of the thing\u2019s grip and bring your weapon to its temple and blow its brains out. It slumps on top of you and you\u2019re quick to get out from under it.\n\nMeanwhile, Donna is on the ground again screaming for you to help her and her assailant chewing on her leg. You wonder helping Donna\u2019s even an option at this point. Donna\u2019s badly wounded and there are still several of those things coming at you, not counting the one currently munching on Donna\u2019s leg.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what these things are except they look like dirty rabid humans. And maybe that\u2019s all they are, but if there\u2019s anything you\u2019ve learned from situations like this is those same clich\u00e9d horror movies is when someone is bitten\u2026\n\nDonna\u2019s eyes widen as soon as she realizes that you\u2019re aiming at her. You don\u2019t give her time to do anything else before you pull the trigger.\n\nHaving done the grim task of putting your sister out of her misery, you run back towards the tents though you\u2019re in a bit of a daze at this point.\n\nThe noise you and those things have caused, start bringing out the occupants of the tents, or at least whoever is using them. You see a few figures with rifles, possibly in uniforms. It\u2019s apparent that they\u2019ve caught sight of you and your pursuers and are yelling something at you, but again your brain has partially \u201cshut down\u201d after killing your sister so you\u2019re stilling running towards them, ignoring the fact that they\u2019re ready to open fire. It wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, since it isn\u2019t like you can run backwards with those things chasing you.\n\nBullets whiz in your direction missing you; at first maybe they AREN\u2019T actually aiming at you and are aiming at the creatures chasing you. Maybe your luck is changing.\n\nBut then you catch one in the head. You don\u2019t even feel it. You just drop like a sack. The military wasn\u2019t taking any chances.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Stay in the trailer park", "result": "Honestly you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea or not, but you\u2019re staying at least for now.\n\n\u201cI still think running on our own is a bad idea. I say we stick around at least for the rest of the day, I mean it\u2019s no good walking off now with the sun about to go down. If it looks like things aren\u2019t going to be too good for us here, I mean we can leave sometime tomorrow. I doubt if the military is going to send anyone else here THAT quick.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, ugh. I still think this is a bad idea, but I suppose I could use that time to try to find someone who would let us borrow their vehicle. That would at least save us from walking.\u201d\n\u201cBorrow? Didn\u2019t know if we were leaving that we were planning on returning.\u201d You snicker.\n\u201cWell, maybe other people will be getting ready to leave too, and maybe we can catch a ride with them at least.\u201d\n\u201cWell that would make leaving at least more of an appealing prospect.\u201d You say and start to leave.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay, I should find out what the game plan is with the rest of these folks. If it looks like they don\u2019t have their shit together, well that\u2019s another mark in favor of leaving.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I suppose I\u2019ll go see if Tina\u2019s done arguing with her boyfriend or whoever he is to her, maybe I can see if she\u2019s receptive to the idea of leaving.\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Donna split up. You mainly wander the trailer park a bit where you occasionally get some stares and a few cat calls, but mostly everyone is busily running around cleaning up or holding various weapons or building supplies in their hands. Mostly all the men.\n\nWhile there is a lot of shouting in general going on, one of these trailer folk is standing around seemingly barking orders at the rest. It\u2019s Mel, Tina\u2019s boyfriend from earlier.\n\n\u201cGet those vehicles to block the main entrance to this place and drag those fucking dead to the field behind this place. We\u2019ll bury their remains there in a big ass pit. After getting everything useful out of those military trucks, we\u2019re going to need to start stripping them down\u2026hey you\u2026blondie, this ain\u2019t no place for ya, I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to get some fuckin\u2019 work done an\u2019 I can\u2019t have you here.\u201d Mel exclaims.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not in anyone\u2019s way and I live in this place! Why can\u2019t I be here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBecause like I said, I\u2019m TRYING to light a fire under these fuckers\u2019 asses, and I can\u2019t do that, if half of them are staring at YOUR ass or are you so dainty that you haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve been attracting a lot of attention. I can\u2019t really help that though, all I\u2019m just trying to do is assess the situation here and if it\u2019s worth staying or not. So are you in charge here now?\u201d\n\u201cWell considering the old bastard that owned this place got his fucking head blown off during the firefight, we are now officially free of any sort of authority whatsoever. However, since I\u2019m only one that realizes what we just did was fucking treason to the highest degree even if it was necessary, I suppose I\u2019m charge of trying to get us all out of this shitstorm. My first goal is to try to get rid of all traces that these soldier boys were even here and attempt to barricade this place somewhat. To be honest though, with all the shit that I\u2019ve been hearing on the news and from what Tina told me yesterday, sounds like the whole world is going to shit and I doubt the government is even going to investigate one shitty little trailer park right away. Assuming if there even IS a government left after all this is over.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really think this place will be safe?\u201d\n\u201cFuck if I know. Probably safer than what\u2019s going on in town right now. All I know is I ain\u2019t running from my home unless I really have to. Look darlin\u2019 I ain\u2019t got the answers for ya as to whether or not you should leave. That\u2019s on you. All I CAN say is I hope you\u2019ve got some sort of useful skill if you intend on stickin\u2019 around because if you HOPE to remain semi-independent and not sucking dick for supper, you\u2019re going to have to pull your weight around here in a meaningful way. Well either that or hook up with one of many fine bachelors round here.\u201d\n\nAt this point Mel smirks and raises his hand towards the many slovenly looking guys walking around as if he\u2019s presenting them like they\u2019re a prize on a game show. Except none of them are prizes and this isn\u2019t a game show.\n\nYou desperately think about your skills and unpredictably you find them lacking, however you do think of one thing that you haven\u2019t done or even thought about in years.\n\n\u201cWell, my mom taught me how to sew when I was little. Haven\u2019t done it in a long time though.\u201d\n\u201cMm, seamstress might be useful, but can you do anything else?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026uh\u2026I killed a man. That\u2019s gotta count for something.\u201d\n\u201cMm, well in some places it might, but it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re the only killer here especially after today. Shit, some of these guys here probably killed before today anyway. But I suppose if worst came to worst, you COULD potentially help out as a guard in a pinch when we get all set up seeing as I know you have the capacity to kill something or someone threatening if need be. Lord, I can just imagine how all these fucktards will be wanting to be paired up with you though. (Sigh) Look seein\u2019 as you\u2019re a friend of Tina\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cActually Tina\u2019s my sister\u2019s friend. I don\u2019t think she really likes me at all.\u201d You interrupt.\n\u201cWell she\u2019s going to like you even fucking less if she sees me speaking with you considering she\u2019s a jealous type, but we\u2019re getting off track. Fuck, what was I sayin\u2019? Oh yeah, look since you\u2019re the sister of Tina\u2019s friend and don\u2019t seem like a complete stuck up cunt, I\u2019ll try to keep the boys from harassin\u2019 you too much. Can\u2019t speak for any of the ladies though. They\u2019re probably going to hate you just as much as Tina\u2026well except for Butchie Billie, who\u2019ll probably be harassing you right along with the boys. I\u2019m just glad Jed and his retarded giant ass brother aren\u2019t here. I think those fuckers were rapists and they would\u2019ve LOVED the likes of you. Anyway, now could you please fuckin\u2019 leave so some work can get done?\u201d\n\nAt this point you leave Mel and return to your trailer where you find Donna.\n\n\u201cI thought you were scouting for a potential vehicle.\u201d You say.\n\u201cApparently none of these hicks are leaving and neither is Tina. Nobody is willing to let me borrow one either.\u201d\n\u201cNone? Didn\u2019t you offer anything?\u201d you ask hintingly.\n\u201cOffer?...Oh yuck! Suzy! Seriously? Do you think I\u2019m just that much of a whore?!\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cWell I mean I know you\u2019re free spirited enough not to give a shit about that sort of thing. I mean that IS how you got this trailer up front isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first that was different. Second that was REALLY unpleasant!\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll be happy to know that old dude is dead now anyway. Mel seems to be in charge of this place now, or at least he alpha male here. Good thing you\u2019re friends with Tina, he said he\u2019d keep the sexual harassment to a minimum while we stay. He\u2019s actually a lot smarter than he appears. He\u2019s currently trying to eliminate all traces of the military being here and making this place more fortified.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo, where does that leave us?\u201d\n\u201cWell in the long term I don\u2019t know. In the short term, we need to pull our weight around here to be useful. So far I\u2019ve secured two possible jobs as a seamstress or a guard.\u201d\n\nDonna looks a little surprised.\n\n\u201cSeamstress huh? You talking about how mom taught you how to sew when we were little? Thought you hadn\u2019t done it in a long time and didn\u2019t care for it.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t and I don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t relish the idea of blowing anyone here for food and water if things get bad. I\u2019ll probably end up being a guard though. Seems a lot easier to potentially shoot people.\u201d\n\u201cGeez Suzy, you\u2019re starting to sound like a completely different person.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well a lot of shit has happened. Anyway, I\u2019m done for today, I\u2019m just going to relax for the rest of the night, since I\u2019m guessing I\u2019ll be doing a lot of work in the near future. It appears I\u2019ve found a job at last, gotta love the irony.\u201d You say.\n\nThe remainder of the night is fairly uneventful if somewhat noisy at times. Donna doesn\u2019t say too much to you and eventually goes to bed, but she once again thanks you for saving her from that soldier. The pair of you bailing each other out of trouble seems to be a reoccurring theme this week.\n\nYou can only hope it isn\u2019t a necessary theme tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026your family will feel right at home in one of our\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAgh, shut the hell up.\u201d You instinctively groan at the Ground Zero ad. You call out for Donna to turn her tv off, but considering she doesn\u2019t, you assume that she must not be here.\n\nYou look around for your phone to check the time, but you can\u2019t find it. You can only assume that you dropped or misplaced it somewhere. Hardly matters, you don\u2019t have too many people to contact anymore at this point. Your relationship with Bobby is over. Julie\u2019s probably dead and who the hell knows what\u2019s happened to the rest of your family in town. It isn\u2019t like you need to call anyone or anyone needs to call you. You\u2019re more pissed about your laptop, which apparently somehow caught a bullet during the mayhem yesterday. So much for keeping up on what might be going on in the world.\n\nIn any case there\u2019s a clock in the trailer and the time indicates that you\u2019ve slept through the morning as usual. Weird, since you fell asleep fairly early. You wonder where the hell Donna could\u2019ve went to, but you\u2019re guessing she might be with her friend Tina.\n\nAfter turning the TV off in Donna\u2019s room, all you\u2019re left with is the noise that\u2019s going on outside. Sounds like the good ol\u2019 boys are still at it. You take a look out one of your windows and see several men in the field taking apart the military trucks, or rather severely altering them. It almost looks like they\u2019re going to build a whole new vehicle out of them or something.\n\nSince there isn\u2019t anyway to entertain yourself with your laptop being shot up, you aren\u2019t in the mood to watch Ground Zero infomercials, and you don\u2019t want to risk the possibility of Donna suddenly walking in on you with your vibrating boyfriend (Thankfully nothing happened to that form of entertainment, though you do worry about batteries for the future) your only option is to head outside and try to find Donna or find something productive to do. You never thought such a day would come where you\u2019d be leaving the comfort of a couch to potentially do some work, but here you are.\n\nAfter going through your routine of washing up and changing clothes, you decide to take the rifle and pistol with you, just in case.\n\nYou exit the trailer and head on over to Tina\u2019s place.\n\nYou knock on the trailer door and hardly recognize Tina without all her makeup on. Not that she\u2019s ugly, in fact she\u2019s actually less trashy looking without it on.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you want blondie?\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cUm, is Donna here?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s not fucking here. Try a few trailers over, I think she took a shine to Jimmy Ray and is over there.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Okay then.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIf you see her, tell her, she better not be distractin\u2019 him all fucking day with her pussy, cause Mel wants him to be workin\u2019 on somethin\u2019. I dunno what, exactly, but I don\u2019t wanna have to listen to him bitch to me about it.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d You answer and begin to leave, but Tina calls out to you.\n\n\u201cHey, you ain\u2019t after, Mel\u2019s dick are ya?\u201d Tina asks which completely catches you off guard.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe told me yesterday, you and he spoke and said you were sweet on him and he had to tell you to stop flirting so much.\u201d\n\nTina looks at you as if she\u2019s detecting if you\u2019re going to lie to her, but you have no intention of doing so since you\u2019re defending yourself from a horrible lie!\n\n\u201cUh, with no disrespect, but Mel is NOT my type and I did not flirt with him.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cSee, I knew that bastard was delusional. I didn\u2019t even believe him when he told me that shit. Any retard can tell that a girl like you would have nothing to do with the likes of him in that way.\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cDid I do something that he could\u2019ve mistaken for flirting?\n\u201cYeah, you were talking to him. He probably told all his friends that you were flirting with him. Hell, he might\u2019ve even said he fucked you, but he tends to keep his tall tales a little more realistic nowadays. Whatever, he\u2019s getting old and likes to think he\u2019s still some sort of chick magnet. Still, I love the sonofabitch despite everything.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re about to finish your illuminating conversation with Tina, you suddenly hear gunshots and yelling.\n\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d you say believing that the military has returned already.\n\nSeveral of the trailer park crew start running towards the noise with weapons in hand. Tina calls out to a skinny one who looks like methhead.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey Dan, what the fuck\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d Tina shouts\n\u201cA bunch of fuckin\u2019 zombies or some shit are attackin\u2019 us! Mel\u2019s called almost everyone to defend the east and south part of the park. Looks like a shitload of them are comin\u2019 from town!\u201d\n\u201cWait, did you just say fuckin\u2019 zombies?\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cYeah. I mean shit, I dunno what they are, I just know Bobby Ray got all bit up by one of them. Maybe they\u2019re just cannibals or high on bath salts. Remember like that one time I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDan, whatever! Just go! Go! Go! And you, get inside here, quick!\u201d Tina says waving away Dan who continues to his destination.\n\u201cBut I gotta find my sister.\u201d You remark\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably safe with Jimmy Ray.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Dan say he just got bit by zombies?\u201d\n\u201cThat was Bobby Ray! Now get yer ass in here, we\u2019ll bar the door and hunker down inside here until Mel and the boys take care of this.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not going to leave your sister\u2019s potential fate in the hands of some redneck who you know nothing about though. You\u2019re going to make the effort to at least find her; besides, you\u2019d rather not barricade yourself in anywhere unless you have to.\n\n\u201cWhere is Jimmy\u2019s trailer again?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a damn idiot blondie. (sigh) it\u2019s more towards the entrance and has a badly spray painted picture of a naked woman on the side of it. I suggest you get a move on.\u201d Tina says and slams her door shut.\n\nYou follow the advice and start heading towards your new destination, which has considerably more gunfire and shouting coming from that direction. You feel like you\u2019re in one of those video games that you played on your computer sometimes, except this is unfortunately very real.\n\nWith your rifle held in front of you the whole time, you continue to move at a quick yet cautious rate. You keep half expecting one of those freaks to suddenly jump out at you every time you pass one of the trailers. You catch a glance of people peeping out their windows of said trailers, sometimes you hear one of them shouting at you to \u201cfind some damn shelter.\u201d\n\nEventually you hear a voice calling at you from above.\n\n\u201cHey blondie, what the hell are you doing down there?\u201d you look up and see a shirtless young man with a shotgun standing on top of the trailer.\n\n\u201cSuzy?! What the hell are you doing?!\u201d another voice shouts, but this one is coming from inside the trailer. Sounds like Donna.\n\nYou glance back down and look at the trailer itself and notice that this is the one you\u2019ve been looking for. You\u2019re guessing that\u2019s Jimmy Ray standing on top of his trailer. You can sort of see Donna going for a guy like him. He\u2019s got a rugged handsome look rather than a grizzled, unkept or outright disgusting appearance that some of the other guys around here have.\n\n\u201cDonna?! I was looking for you, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing out here.\u201d You say while swiveling your head in several directions to keep an eye on your surroundings.\n\u201cWell now you\u2019ve found me, now get inside!\u201d Donna shouts and starts to open up the door.\n\u201cDonna, don\u2019t leave that door open too long, I\u2019m watching the main fighting at the front of the park and it\u2019s not looking good. The east side is doing better though.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you suppose to be helping Mel?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cPfft, yeah right. I mean I don\u2019t hate him or anything, but I\u2019m not riskin\u2019 my life for that asshole. Oh fuck! More of them are getting through, and I mean a shitload! Get your asses inside!\u201d Jimmy Ray shouts and starts aiming his shotgun.\n\nYou look and see a couple of the\u2026things Dan was talking about. This is insane. Here you were worrying about the military and some unexpected threat like\u2026zombies shows up? They can\u2019t be zombies, they just can\u2019t!\n\nWhatever they are, four of them are flailing about wildly and growling. They notice you and begin loping at you. The mere sight of them is troubling, but you quickly point your rifle at them and start firing.\n\nJimmy\u2019s shotgun gets one of them in the leg which he then shoots again in the body. Another gets its head blown off. You use up the remainder of the clip to kill the two remaining. One of them didn\u2019t even drop down dead until he almost reached you. They don\u2019t look rotten (though they do look dirty and disheveled\u2026which isn\u2019t unlike some of the hillbillies here) and you didn\u2019t even shoot one in the head, so while they may NOT be zombies, they\u2019re certainly inhuman enough for you to be scared. (Some sort of sickness perhaps?)\n\nMeanwhile Donna\u2019s at the door and calling to you. You see now that she\u2019s not wearing her own clothes, but rather a robe of some sort. Certainly not hers.\n\n\u201cSuzy, please! Get inside NOW!\u201d she shouts as more of those things come running in your direction.\n\u201cGoddamn it, the pair of you need to get inside!\u201d Jimmy shouts as he snaps off another shot.\n\nWhile the freaks are definitely advancing, they\u2019re also splitting up to attack several trailers. You wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just get Donna and make your way out of here since it looks like this place is going to be overrun.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get in the trailer", "result": "As tempting as it is to just run, once again, you don\u2019t really have anywhere viable to run to and now you\u2019d have a horde of those things possibly dogging your steps if you did, so you\u2019re going to just be satisfied with short term safety and keep optimistic that things aren\u2019t as hopeless as they seem.\n\nYou run up the stairs and into the trailer. Donna slams and locks the door, and then you both shove a couch in front of it. You look up at the ceiling of the trailer and see the sun roof open which naturally explains how Jimmy Ray got up there. You can hear him firing and swearing.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think we should be safe now.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that. I mean yeah, they\u2019d have a hell of time breaking through the door, and granted the windows are high enough that they might have trouble breaking and climbing into them, but I still don\u2019t feel safe cooped up in here.\u201d You say and start looking around for more furniture and start moving a table under the sunroof.\n\n\u201cSuzy, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go help your boyfriend if I can. You got a weapon down here?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s Jimmy\u2019s bat and some knives in the kitchen, but he really doesn\u2019t need your help. You should stay down here, I mean what if they try to break in like you said?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be able to shoot them from above a lot better from the roof. Climb up if things start getting grim.\u201d You say and start climb through the roof.\n\nWhen you reach the roof, Jimmy notices you as he\u2019s in the middle of reloading his weapon.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doin\u2019 up here, get back in the trailer with your sister!\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d You say scanning the area.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need any help, now\u2026\u201d\n\nYou interrupt Jimmy, when you look over the other side of the trailer, see one particularly sneaky freak skulking near it and shoot him.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t even paying attention to the other side of the trailer. You need to be aware of your surroundings!\u201d you say.\n\u201cAw, he couldn\u2019t have gotten up here, and I would\u2019ve heard him had he tried.\u201d Jimmy remarks. \u201cFine, stay up here, but don\u2019t get in my way!\u201d he then adds realizing that you aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nFrom on top of the trailer, you can see a good deal more of the park in general. You and Jimmy actually aren\u2019t the only ones standing on a trailer, you see several women with guns doing their best at fighting off this horde. You even see Tina when you look back towards her trailer.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t quite as grim as it once appeared as you see a group of hillbillies from the east side of the park making their way back and soon start helping out with mopping up the freaks that have infested it.\n\nJimmy and yourself mostly keep to picking off the ones that come too close to his trailer. He actually compliments you or your shooting at one point. To be honest, it\u2019s sort of weird to you how much of a natural you are at it.\n\nAfter few more bloody minutes, it\u2019s mostly over and the\u2026well you still don\u2019t know WHAT they are exactly, but they\u2019re no longer the threat they were.\n\n\u201cWhew, I think we got the last of those sons of bitches.\u201d Jimmy says.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not in any hurry to check. I\u2019m out of bullets anyway, so I\u2019m just going to go back into the trailer with my sister.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna keep an eye out from here. Um\u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure about you at first, but thanks for yer help.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Donna\u2019s head pops up from the opening in the roof.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on up here? The shooting has mostly stopped, is it over?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over in the sense that I\u2019m guessing we aren\u2019t in any danger of being overrun. Was everything okay down there? We were trying to keep them from clawing at the trailer too much.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, a few got as close as the door and then one of you guys shot them.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cShit, let\u2019s get back down in the trailer.\u201d Jimmy suddenly says walking over to where you and Donna are.\n\u201cDid you just see more of those things?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I see\u2026\n\n\u201cThere you are, ya slackin\u2019 piece of shit! Where the fuck were you when we needed help over on the east side of the park. Nearly got my ass eaten and not in a good way!\u201d Mel shouts from the ground as he walks with a couple of other men behind him.\n\n\u201cAw Mel, I didn\u2019t even know about it until it was too late, I was uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinkin\u2019 with yer dick as usual. Is that\u2026is that blondie there I see? Holy shit, didn\u2019t think you were fool enough to fall fer this idiot\u2019s charms.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026I was looking for my sister and I helped her and Jimmy out here.\u201d\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d Mel asks.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true! I was with her sister\u2026and um, by the time I knew what was goin\u2019 on I couldn\u2019t leave this trailer because it was surrounded by those things! I was pickin\u2019 them off with the shotgun and then Suzy came here and helped out. Good thing too. There were a shitload of them, as you can tell by the bodies!\u201d Jimmy says and begins pointing at them.\n\nMel stares at the bodies that Jimmy\u2019s pointing to and doesn\u2019t seem impressed.\n\n\u201cJimmy, yer so full of shit right now, yer eyes are brown. By the number of bodies here and their various distances from the trailer, it wasn\u2019t THAT surrounded. Whatever, doesn\u2019t matter, come on down, you\u2019re comin\u2019 with us.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we goin?\u201d Jimmy asks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go try to fetch some medical supplies from town. We got some people hurt pretty fuckin\u2019 bad an\u2019 other than a few half used basic medical kits that a few people scrounged up, all else we got is a shitload of alcohol. You\u2019d think those military trucks woulda had some medical shit in them, but no. I suppose SOME people here got some meth, crack and a few other unconventional drugs, but last thing we need is more goddamn junkies runnin\u2019 around here.\u201d Mel says glaring at Dan.\n\u201cTown? Um\u2026don\u2019t ya think it\u2019ll be pretty fucked up there?\u201d Jimmy asks.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s gonna be fucked up there, but it needs to get done. Or we at least need to try. So come on Jimmy, get yer ass down here, what about you blondie?\u201d Mel asks.\n\u201cWhat about me what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYou gonna come with us? Obviously you\u2019re good enough with a weapon to take care of yourself an\u2019 we\u2019re a little short on that at the moment.\u201d\n\nAs Jimmy kisses Donna on the cheek and tells her something about coming back to her, you briefly consider Mel\u2019s offer. While you\u2019ve certainly \u201cgrown\u201d past being the wallflower you tended to be, you know you\u2019re not some action heroine badass.\n\n\u201cWhile I appreciate the offer Mel, I think I\u2019d be better off staying here, I\u2019m still not as skilled as you guys are when it comes to shooting. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a liability.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, I guess that\u2019s an honest assessment of yourself. Alright then, keep an eye out on things here. As for the rest of ya, come on let\u2019s round up a few more folks and then let\u2019s see just how fucked the town is.\u201d Mel says and he and the rest walk off leaving you and Donna who duck back inside Jimmy\u2019s trailer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you didn\u2019t go with them. I mean that\u2019s gotta be a suicide mission.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cWell it will certainly be dangerous that\u2019s for sure.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo you still think it\u2019s a good idea to stay here?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cStill want to leave huh?\u201d you say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you? I mean we just went through TWO major attacks at this place now! Who knows what the hell is gonna hit us next! More of those freaks probably, but I\u2019m thinking that we got a better chance if we do leave this time.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell Jimmy Ray\u2019s got a truck that he parked between his trailer and the next one as a poor man\u2019s barrier of sorts and he didn\u2019t take his keys with him. In fact they\u2019re over on the table over there. That suggests to me that we can easily take his while he\u2019s gone. In fact, Mel and most of those redneck assholes will all be gone and the others are nursing their wounds, so now would be the perfect time to get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\u201cI used up all my ammo fighting off those cannibal things. What about weapons?\u201d\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to get by on close combat ones for awhile, but Jimmy\u2019s probably got another gun in his bedroom somewhere. Look, I\u2019ll search this place and you go grab your bags from our trailer. I still got a bag packed near my bed from yesterday, so you can grab that one too.\u201d\n\nYou chuckle a bit at Donna\u2019s suggestion of completely robbing Jimmy Ray blind and take her plan into consideration.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the park", "result": "Given that you\u2019ve been attacked by military, as well as a bunch of cannibal freaks\u2026 well sticking around here is looking a lot less desirable now and Donna\u2019s idea is looking a lot more enticing.\n\nPlus if you were planning on ripping off this place and running off, this would be the best time to do it while everyone is a bit disarray and Mel and the better defenders of this place are gone.\n\n\u201cOkay Donna I\u2019m with you on this, but we really gotta do this shit quick.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell of course. Like I said, you run over to our trailer and grab my bag and your own and rush back over. By the time you\u2019re done, I should have found Jimmy\u2019s keys and whatever else he\u2019s got here that looks interesting.\u201d Donna replies.\n\nYou and Donna nod at the agreement of this plan then you slip out of the trailer and try to keep a low profile. It really isn\u2019t difficult since the few people walking around don\u2019t even know you and seem to be busy cleaning up the dead freaks lying on the ground. You do spot Tina, however and deliberately avoid her since if anyone is going to attempt to hold you up for any reason, it would likely be her.\n\nWhen you get to your trailer, you pack what items and clothing you can in your bags, zip \u2018em up and then sling one over your shoulder then with your free hand you go into the bedroom and grab Tina\u2019s bag.\n\nYou leave your trailer and try to make it over to Jimmy\u2019s as quick as you can.\n\nYou get half way there and then you hear a familiar voice\u2026\n\n\u201cHey blondie! Knew you survived, where the hell ya been, there\u2019s fuckin\u2019 work to do. Need all the help we can moving these fuckin\u2019 bodies.\u201d Tina shouts.\n\nYou silently say \u201cshit\u201d to yourself and slowly turn around thinking up a lie that won\u2019t attract too much suspicion, while at the same time is going to allow you avoid whatever work Tina had in mind for you.\n\n\u201cOh hey Tina. I\u2019ve been\u2026um just trying to recover from that recent attack just like everyone else. It was all sort of discombobulating you know?\u201d you say.\n\u201cDiscom\u2026what the fuck? Whatever, you don\u2019t look hurt, so yer ass is needed to help move some bodies\u2026and what\u2019s with all the bags?\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cWell, my sister Donna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah where the fuck is Donna? She ain\u2019t bit is she? Cause they put all those fuckers in a separate trailer. Even though I think they should just shoot the infected bastards. We all know how those movies go!\u201d Tina interrupts.\n\u201cUh, no. She\u2019s fine. Well not fine\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSpeak fucking plain blondie!\u201d\n\u201cMy sister isn\u2019t hurt physically, but she hasn\u2019t handled the recent attack very well\u2026she\u2019s a wreck actually. Hysterical one moment, silent shock the next. Took me awhile to calm her down. She says she\u2019d feel safer staying with Jimmy Ray, so that\u2019s why I got all these bags with her stuff. I\u2019m taking them over there.\u201d\n\u201cDonna broke down? Always thought she was miss cool, calm and collected and got over shit fairly quickly\u2026hmmm, guess a few days sober in the face of brutal reality might break someone normally living in a drug, alcohol and sex fueled fantasy realm. I don\u2019t remember her having all that shit. In fact aren\u2019t some of those your bags?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she never brought that many clothes and I figured she could borrow some of my stuff. Figured I\u2019d let her choose while I continued to talk with her. I mean I can still help with body moving thing, but I just really need to go help my sister first.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine. No point in having a hysterical bitch making life miserable with bouts of screaming. Do what you need to do, but as soon as yer done, you help out with moving these bodies.\u201d\n\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll really try to be quick.\u201d You say.\n\nAfter parting company with Tina, you continue to head over to Jimmy\u2019s as quick as you can where Donna is sitting on a chair waiting for you.\n\n\u201cWould\u2019ve been quicker, but I had to talk my way out of moving dead bodies with Tina.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, here.\u201d Donna says and takes her bag while thrusting a pistol into your hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one I could find. You might as well take it, since you\u2019re obviously more experienced with shooting than I am by now.\u201d\n\u201cWell thanks I guess. You got the keys too I trust?\u201d\n\u201cYep, truck\u2019s right next to this trailer. Though getting out isn\u2019t going to be as quick as I\u2019d like due to the way its parked, but we\u2019ll just deal with that as it comes. You ready?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nYou and Donna run out of the trailer and turn the corner where Jimmy\u2019s truck is parked. Donna was right about how it\u2019s parked. Somehow he managed to wedge it between his trailer and the neighboring one pretty good. Donna\u2019s going to have to do a lot of reversing and forward driving to get it out, but you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re going to have time for all that.\n\nThrowing the bags in the back of the pick up, Donna gets into the driver\u2019s seat and quickly unlocks the passenger sider before starting up the truck. DOesn\u2019t take long before Donna\u2019s bashing the hell out of the front end AND the back end of the truck against the trailers, attempting to get it out of it\u2019s parking space.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t take long before several people hear this noise.\n\n\u201cHEY! THOSE TWO BITCHES ARE TRYING TO STEAL ONE OF OUR TRUCKS!\u201d a voice shouts.\n\nSeveral of the trailer park residents attempt to rush at the truck at first, but after you fire a few shots at them, they retreat and re-think that plan.\n\n\u201cDonna come on! We ain\u2019t got much time before they go and get their guns and start firing back!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cI know! I know! Fuck! Shit! This truck is really wedged in!\u201d Donna shouts.\n\nThe scraping of metal and the continued destruction of the truck\u2019s front end is in full force as Donna decides to just give the truck a hard turn in an attempt to escape. It works and you\u2019re soon free, now you just have to drive out of the vicinity of the trailer park altogether because now bullets are damaging the truck.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d\n\u201cJust get to the road Donna and drive west!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cIt should be just a little, oh fuck!\u201d Donna shouts as suddenly hits one of the rednecks with the truck. In fact she ran right over her.\n\u201cGo! Go! Just fucking go!\u201d you shout ducking your head down as another bullet breaks the back window.\n\nSoon, Donna manages to get back on the road though there are a few more shots fired in your direction.\n\n\u201cGoddamnit, I think they hit the tires! This thing\u2019s getting hard to control!\u201d Donna shouts.\n\u201cWell we\u2019re going to have to ride the rims, because we\u2019re not out of danger yet.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cGot that right bitch!\u201d a voice suddenly says and then a large arm with a hook comes through the broken back window.\n\nYou\u2019re startled enough by this unexpected event that you fumble with your pistol and drop it on the floor. As you scramble for the pistol, Donna screams and attempts to simultaneously keep control of the vehicle as well as not get impaled with a large metal object.\n\nWhen you finally get the pistol, an elbow goes into your face and a hand tries to grab your weapon. Donna slams on the breaks, which causes this unwanted hitchhiker to lose her grip on you and fall backwards a bit though she manages to hang on by embedding her hook into the front seat of the truck. Still, it\u2019s just enough time for you to gain the advantage.\n\nYou swing around to turn to your attacker and see an angry looking woman with a buzz cut before you shoot her. At this range you don\u2019t miss and half of her face is blown off before she releases her grip from the hook and her body falls backwards towards the tail end of the truck bed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead, get us the hell outta here before the rest catch up!\u201d you shout seeing a few people coming from the trailer park.\n\u201cHoly shit, who the hell was that and how the hell did she sneak into the truck bed?!\u201d Donna says flooring the gas.\n\u201cDunno, doesn\u2019t matter, like I said, get us the hell outta here!\u201d\n\nDonna\u2019s a little shaken up from all this, but keeps her cool and by the time you put a lot of distance between you and the trailer park she\u2019s a lot calmer. Still, you\u2019re concerned that someone is going to give chase in another vehicle.\n\n\u201cFuck, that was intense.\u201d Donna exclaims.\n\u201cYeah, well I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy when you suggested it.\u201d\n\u201cStill, we did it though. When me and you work as a team we seem to overcome all odds.\u201d Donna says in a slightly upbeat tone.\n\u201cWell so far things have worked in our favor. Sort of worried about how far we\u2019re actually going to get in this truck though. We\u2019ve got at least one damaged back tire and who knows if they\u2019re going to pursue us in their own vehicles.\u201d You say.\n\nAt this point you continue to look behind you to see if anyone is following, but happily you don\u2019t see anyone. You and Donna don\u2019t say much for the next few miles. Maybe it\u2019s because neither of you really knows what\u2019s going to come next. You\u2019re in a rural area with a truck that may or may not be drivable for very long. Neither of you has any money or anything really to barter with if you needed to fix it in someway. Well there is ONE thing you both have, but you\u2019re not exactly willing to do that. (Though you imagine it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for your sister)\n\nIf anything, your mindset has gotten a bit on the darker side of things due to the past few days. If the world is indeed going the way of chaos, you\u2019re starting to think why not embrace it? You have a gun, and so far you\u2019ve come to the conclusion that they\u2019ve been solving a lot of problems for you.\n\nAs you dwell on these thoughts, your sister suddenly speaks.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, there\u2019s a group of tents up ahead. Looks almost like a circus or something. I thought I heard someone mention at the trailer park about one up this way. Should we stop and see if we can get help there?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cHmm, nah. We should keep going. We still need to put more distance between us and that damn trailer park. Besides, I doubt if a bunch of carnies is going to be much better than a bunch of rednecks.\u201d You answer.\n\nDonna nods and continues to drive. Leaving you to your thoughts, which are now starting to envision improving your situation by robbing some idiot of their belongings.\n\nYou turn the radio on in an attempt to find something to keep your mind occupied, but its mostly Ground Zero commercials. You get a few doomsday religious preachers too, which is even worse. You turn off the radio in dismay and return to your introspection until Donna speaks up again.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you reply.\n\u201cDo you think the world is going to end?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe. Though as far as I\u2019m concerned, it already ended for me when I had to leave my basement.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I suppose it would. Hey, if you want we could turn around and go home. You could take back your basement and shoot Kelly in the face.\u201d\n\nYou chuckle a bit at that suggestion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a tempting idea. I think we\u2019re better off driving into the unknown though. Like you said, when we work as a team, it somehow works out for us.\u201d You say which Donna returns your sentiment with a smile.\n\nEventually the day starts turning to night and you start to get tired. The stress of the day has finally caught up with you. Surprisingly Donna\u2019s still alert. So far the truck hasn\u2019t given any problems though you know you\u2019re riding on a flat (or at least low) back tire by this point.\n\nYou honestly don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do next, but for now you\u2019re going to try to get some rest as you drift off to sleep\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026hey Suzy\u2026get up.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s going on? What time is it?\u201d you answer half asleep.\n\u201cI dunno, I think it\u2019s getting up for the afternoon. Really I\u2019m sort of surprised you didn\u2019t at least stir a little since you fell asleep last night. You really are a deep sleeper.\u201d\n\u201cGuess yesterday\u2019s cannibal killing and grand theft auto really took it out of me. Hey we\u2019re not moving.\u201d You say looking around and seeing that you\u2019re parked off the side of the road.\n\u201cNo, I pulled over to sleep sometime after midnight.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That was dangerous! You should\u2019ve woke me up then! I could\u2019ve kept a look out or even taken over with the driving! I mean we could\u2019ve been attacked by who knows what during the night!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWe were fine. While I\u2019ve seen a few abandoned vehicles, I haven\u2019t seen a single person driving on this road since we started yesterday. Nobody behind us, and nobody coming from the other direction either.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if we were driving in a fucking desolate wasteland, we\u2019ve got cannibals running around, a break down of society and there\u2019s still the potential of angry rednecks coming after us! Next time THINK!\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026okay\u2026sorry Suzy.\u201c Donna says rather meekly.\n\nYou give Donna a dirty look, but tell her to forget it. Actually you\u2019re sort of surprised she didn\u2019t put up more of a fight since it\u2019s not like her to back down from an argument, but maybe she\u2019s becoming a little afraid of you.\n\n\u201cWell, seeing as things are deader than a tomb around here, we might as well take this opportunity to dump our passenger in the back.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Donna replies.\n\nAs you step out of the truck, you look at her to do likewise to help.\n\n\u201cOh. Wait, you wanted me to help?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the idea.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Alright.\u201d\n\nYou and Donna go to the back of the truck and open up the tailgate. The redneck woman\u2019s head that was propped up on it slumps in front of you. Flies have already begun gathering on her face.\n\n\u201cUgh. She\u2019s already beginning to rot.\u201d Donna says and chokes a bit.\n\u201cShe was pretty tall that\u2019s for sure. It is sort of amazing she managed to jump in the truck bed without us realizing it. Maybe it was when you ran over that other girl.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cShe fucking attacked us with a hook too. That\u2019s like something out of a horror movie.\u201d\n\u201cEverything about what\u2019s happened to us this week is like something out of a horror movie. I saw Tina with one of those hooks yesterday, I think they were moving bodies with them. Y\u2019know, I never officially met her\u2026but I think this was the infamous Butchie Billie I\u2019d hear about every so often. Anyway, let\u2019s pull her dead ass out.\u201d\n\nGrabbing one arm and Donna grabbing the other, you pull what you believe to be the corpse of Butchie Billie out of the truck. Donna doesn\u2019t have that great of a hold on her and drops her end causing you to nearly fall to the ground too.\n\n\u201cGoddamnit Donna, you can\u2019t\u2026argh. Fuck it. I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d you say in exasperation.\n\nYou proceed to kick and roll the body further away from the road and into the brush.\n\n\u201cGood enough.\u201d You say breathing a little heavy. \u201cWhew, open up one of my bags, I\u2019m fairly certain I packed a few bottles of water in there.\u201d\n\nDonna gets in the bed of the truck and starts unzipping bags. Eventually she finds the water and passes you one and takes one for herself.\n\nAs you drink, you notice both of your back tires are completely flat. You knew one of them was, but you guess the other one gave up during the night.\n\n\u201cOur tires are fucked. I mean we could still drive on them, but it wouldn\u2019t be a pleasant ride.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter really, judging by the gauge last night we\u2019re almost out of gas too. Jimmy apparently didn\u2019t keep this truck gassed up in case of an emergency.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\n\u201cI mean I suppose we could just keep driving until we can\u2019t anymore or we possibly find an auto shop.\u201d\n\u201cAuto shop? Out in the sticks?\u201d\n\u201cWell I dunno, don\u2019t they usually have those last chance gas mechanic things along roadsides like this? Besides I think we\u2019re starting to get past the farmland and should be hitting more populated areas soon. Security City is this way after all.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cGiven what happened to our town, that might not be a good thing. We still don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on. All we do know is the government declared martial law and there are rabid people running around.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t suggesting we go to Security City, I was just saying we should be hitting more populated areas due it being close by. Look, obviously I don\u2019t have a good idea of what to do next, so if you got a long term plan, then by all means let\u2019s follow it.\u201d\n\nBefore you can reply, you hear the sound of vehicle. You peek your head out from behind the truck and see a car heading in your direction. It\u2019s going at a good pace, but MAYBE you can stop it.\n\n\u201cDonna, a car\u2019s coming. Quick, tear your clothing and go out in the road and look like a slutty damsel in distress!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cJust fucking do it!\u201d you say and check to see how many bullets you have.\n\nDonna, gets the picture quickly, though you can tell she\u2019s not entirely happy with this arrangement.\n\nYou hide behind the truck\u2019s side away from the road, while Donna gets in the middle of the road and waves her arms. You can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually enacting a plan you thought up in your head just yesterday.\n\nYou just hope whoever the driver is; they actually stop and don\u2019t try to do something like say run over Donna instead.\n\nThe car approaches and actually starts to slow down and then eventually stops, but it does so at a distance. Someone then steps out of the passenger side armed with a sub-machine gun.\n\n\u201cAlright honey, if you want to live, I suggest you don\u2019t move.\u201d He says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot! I\u2019m completely unarmed! This isn\u2019t some sort of trick! Please, I just need help, my truck has flat tires and I don\u2019t have any way now to get to Security City!\u201d Donna exclaims.\n\u201cSecurity City? Hah! You don\u2019t wanna go there trust me. The whole place is fucked! If the military doesn\u2019t round you up and kill ya, the cannibal freaks running all over the place will.\u201d The man shouts.\n\nWell you know that place is definitely off the list now.\n\n\u201cOh no! I don\u2019t know where to go then! I\u2019m just so lost by myself! Where are you guys going? Can I come with you?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cCome with us? Look, I dunno if that\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019re pretty full up with shit and there isn\u2019t much room in this car\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t take up much room. I mean I\u2019ll sit on your lap if I have to.\u201d\n\u201cSit on my\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook I\u2019ll do anything you and your friend want! I\u2019ll suck your cocks and fuck you if I have to! Just I can\u2019t be alone! Not after those things tried to kill and eat me yesterday!\u201d Donna screams and starts to rub her eyes and sniffling.\n\nAt this point the man with the sub-machine gun pauses.\n\n\u201cHold on.\u201d He says and then converses with his driver buddy for a moment. You continue to wait patiently hoping they take this bait.\n\n\u201cAlright honey, you can come with us, but that payment you just offered? Well we\u2019ll be taking it now, so I hope you\u2019re ready to back up your promises.\u201d The passenger shouts and then gets back in the car, which slowly drives up closer to meet Donna.\n\nWhen they drive up near the other side of the truck, you wonder if you should wait a little longer to make sure they\u2019re completely vulnerable or sneak around the truck and open fire now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Open fire now", "result": "You sneak around towards the front end of the truck and then see Mr. passenger get out of the car.\n\n\u201cOkay baby, where are we doing this? The back seat of the car is pretty full as you can see. We can do it in your truck if you want. Front seat or the bed of it. Doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d He says and then you come out from your hiding spot to blast him in the head.\n\n\u201cOH SHIT MITCH GET BACK IN THE FUCKING CAR!\u201d the driver shouts. He must\u2019ve seen you in his rear view mirror and it\u2019s distracting enough that you miss your shot allowing Mitch to duck and scramble for the cover of the car.\n\nAt this point Donna screams and runs off and you start firing into the car. You aren\u2019t sure if you hit the driver or not, but the car starts going in reverse. Not at an excessively fast speed, but you barely get out the way.\n\nFalling back on your ass you watch as the car continues rolling past you with the driver slumped over the wheel.\n\nUnfortunately you aren\u2019t able to celebrate this good fortune because while you were falling and trying to get out a rolling car\u2019s way, Mitch ran around the front of the rolling car and around your truck to get the drop on you.\n\nYou recover just in time to see a sub-machine gun pointed at you and then the muzzle flash of multiple bullets ripping your skull apart.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Wait a little longer", "result": "You decide that it would be best if they were completely pre-occupied. If you shoot now, the driver could either manage to drive off or the passenger could start spraying the place with bullets.\n\nStill, you sneak around towards the front end of the truck so you can at least ambush from behind when you do strike.\n\n\u201cOkay baby, where are we doing this? The back seat of the car is pretty full as you can see. We can do it in your truck if you want. Front seat or the bed of it. Doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d The passenger says getting back out of the car.\n\u201cUh, no not the truck. It got all shot up yesterday, back window broke and there\u2019s broken glass everywhere. Don\u2019t want to potentially get cut up.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well the hood of this car then?\u201d\n\nAt this point Donna walks up to him and starts to do what she does best. Namely act like a slut.\n\n\u201cHow about I do the both of you at the same time? That way you both get off and we can be on our way a lot quicker.\u201d she says and starts rubbing up against Mr. passenger.\n\u201cWell now. That\u2019s an interesting suggestion\u2026how were you proposing the logistics of this?\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2019s easy\u2026 you see, first I take off my clothes\u2026\u201d Donna says and quickly takes her clothing off until she\u2019s completely naked.\n\n\u201cNext, I just get on my knees in this front seat here\u2026 and start to unbuckle your friend\u2019s pants\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t see the driver from your position since he\u2019s never moved out from his seat, but he\u2019s obviously okay with this since you hear a couple of moans of pleasure.\n\n\u201cAnd now\u2026well don\u2019t just stand there silly. My ass is right in front of you, start fucking!\u201d Donna commands.\n\u201cWait, you want me to fuck you in the ass?!\u201d Mr. passenger asks.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not gonna fuck itself. Do what you want. I gotta concentrate on wrapping my lips around this nice hard cock\u2026mmmmm\u2026\u201d\n\nHoly shit, talk about taking one for the team\u2026hell taking TWO for the team.\n\nAt this point Mr. passenger can\u2019t err on the side of caution any longer. He places his gun on the roof of the car and presumably starts taking your sister in a way that you imagine many men have taken her before.\n\nWith one dick in her mouth and another in her ass, you\u2019re fairly confident now that Donna\u2019s distracted them both to the point that you have the complete advantage.\n\nYou step out from the front of truck and walk towards the car parked near it. Mr. passenger\u2019s eyes aren\u2019t watching as he\u2019s focused on thrusting into your sister. His head is a perfect target and with a single shot, you end him as a threat.\n\n\u201cOh shit! Oh shit! ARGH! MY DICK! FUCKING BITCH!\u201d you hear the driver shout.\n\nYou rush over to the driver\u2019s side and point the gun at his head before he can start beating on your sister\u2019s head in an effort to get her off his dick.\n\n\u201cYou move to your hands to hit my sister and you die. You try to start up the car and you die. If you want your life AND your dick to stay intact then I suggest you follow my orders. First thing, car keys.\u201d\n\u201cOKAY OKAY! ARGH! JUST TELL HER TO STOP BITING MY DICK!\u201d the driver shouts and hastily hands you his car keys.\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a start. Alright, Donna, you can release his dick now, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\n\nDonna complies and then spits in the driver\u2019s face before he staggers out of the car with his pants half down. You tell her to grab your bags from the truck and put them in the car.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to be taking this car and everything in it. In exchange, you can take our truck. Granted it has two flat tires and is low on gas, but if you\u2019re lucky, you might just reach a trailer park that has lots of people willing to help you. You ready Donna?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\nYou turn back to the driver who is still mostly holding on to his dick wincing in pain.\n\n\u201cOkay, well I guess this is where we part ways. Thanks for the info about Security City. We\u2019ll be sure to avoid going there\u2026and uh\u2026bye. Oh, and watch your head.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d is all the driver says before you shoot him and get in the car.\n\n\u201cI thought you were letting him live.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cWhat? And let a man who defiled my poor sister\u2019s mouth walk away to brag about it? Not fucking likely.\u201d You say and start the car up.\n\nAs you spin the car around to head back in your original direction, you ask Donna if she\u2019s okay since she\u2019s fidgeting a bit in her seat.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026um, are you okay?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s done. We worked together and we succeeded. I think we both know our established roles are in this team. We all have our talents. Let\u2019s not talk about it.\u201c Donna says.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t exactly sound angry, but she obviously isn\u2019t leaping for joy about what she did. You almost want to talk more about what just happened, but given that your sister doesn\u2019t you don\u2019t press the issue and just drive.\n\nAs you\u2019re driving, Donna suddenly speaks up again.\n\n\u201cNext time, don\u2019t fucking kill the guy while he\u2019s still inside me. Tell him to move away or something first. I had a dead man\u2019s dick shooting cum in my ass for a split second before he fell. I\u2019ll admit to being a free spirited gal comfortable with my sexuality, but I didn\u2019t want to include necrophilia in my list of things I\u2019m willing to do.\u201d\n\nWow. You didn\u2019t really expect to hear that graphic detail. It\u2019s actually a bit nasty and you can see why Donna\u2019s in the mood she\u2019s in.\n\n\u201cOkay Donna. Damn, sorry about that. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell like I said, it\u2019s done. Let\u2019s just not speak of it again. (Sigh) Probably for the best he didn\u2019t go the traditional route or else he might\u2019ve impregnated me when he shot his load and I might\u2019ve given birth to zombie babies or some shit.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\nThe situation is pretty fucked up, but you\u2019re having a hard trying not to laugh now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it works that way Donna. Pretty sure you would\u2019ve given birth to a normal baby.\u201d You say with a stifled chuckle.\n\u201cYeah, well that would be just as bad.\u201d\n\nYou decide not to make any more comments even though there\u2019s a really twisted part of you that is finding this all pretty amusing and wants to make jokes. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re sort of getting a kick out of Donna\u2019s discomfort. Maybe it\u2019s pent up hostility you\u2019ve had for her due to how she\u2019s acted towards you in the past. Maybe it\u2019s some sort of sadistic side you\u2019ve always harbored and it\u2019s just recently come out due to this week\u2019s events.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s slightly worrying to you, since you\u2019re starting to wonder how far you\u2019re going to start abandoning \u201ccivility.\u201d You\u2019ve already committed murder on several occasions, and while the first time was in self-defense, the ones following it have been getting progressively more predatory.\n\nA few more remorseless murders and you\u2019re going to be just like your Uncle Ed. (Now you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s genetic)\n\nYou and Donna continue to drive. A couple of other cars do pass you on the road. You imagine they must be coming from Security City or fleeing it from your previous information. You\u2019re just glad you haven\u2019t come across any military trying to block the road.\n\nYou continue to drive for about a half hour before you see something of interest in the distance. Namely a truck stop, which apparently has been converted into a minor fortress.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s interesting.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIs that a truck stop?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cYeah I think so. Looks like whoever is there are trying to block the place off by putting trucks around it. They even got people standing on top of the trucks with rifles as lookouts. \u201c you say.\n\u201cAre we stopping there?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Whoever is there probably isn\u2019t going to be too trustful of anyone. Though, we still don\u2019t have that much of long term plan. A place like this might be a safe haven of sorts. I mean it already looks way better defended than that trailer park.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you. But I think we\u2019re going to have to be more careful at a place like this.\u201d\n\u201cWe might as well chance it if only to catch a breather and maybe get some directions because I can honestly say I don\u2019t know where the fuck we are or where we should be going. That\u2019s assuming they even let us in.\u201d\n\nYou and Donna drive to the truck stop, which immediately causes the lookouts to point and raise their rifles in your direction. When you stop in front of it, there are a lot of shouts for you to stay in the car.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just letting anyone in here. Who are ya, and state yer business!\u201d the lookout from above shouts.\n\u201cJust a couple poor souls trying to escape the chaos out there! Our home town was overrun by military and crazy people. We\u2019ve also been attacked by others who would try to take advantage of us. Please, we\u2019re just looking for some sort of refuge even if it\u2019s temporary. We got some supplies in our car.\u201d\n\u201cHrmmm, well whatta you got?\u201d\n\nYou turn your head to look in the back seat to actually see what you \u201cinherited\u201d since you never looked before. You see a first aid kit on top of a pile of bags.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026we got some medicine. Maybe that could help?\u201d you say.\n\nThere is a long pause and he tells you to wait before climbing down the truck and disappearing from sight. Eventually you hear his voice again which is now coming from behind the truck barricade.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna move this truck, but one funny thing happens and you\u2019re the first one getting a bullet to the head. Alright, we\u2019re letting this one in, everyone keep extra look out for those rabid bastards!\u201d\n\nAs soon as the truck is moved out your way, the man who was barking orders at you waves you in and motions you over to a parking spot with some other cars. As soon as you drive in they put the truck back. Either they\u2019re really safety conscience or they don\u2019t want to risk having you get away.\n\n\u201cWell let\u2019s hope these people are just normal people trying to survive and aren\u2019t a gang of rapists.\u201d You remark.\n\nFrom this distance you see several more people in the building part of the truck stop. Looks like it\u2019s a general store/diner combo. Most of them are watching you from the windows, though a few of them come out, one of them is an older man with a cane who walks directly towards the car.\n\n\u201cOkay, I want the two you in that car to exit it slowly. I don\u2019t care if you got weapons, but don\u2019t point them at me or anyone else in a threatening manner.\u201d The old man shouts.\n\nYou take your pistol and shove it in the front of your pants. As for your newly acquired sub-machine gun, you just leave it in the car when you and Donna exit it. Naturally rifles are pointed at the pair of you, but the old man with the cane shouts telling them to calm down.\n\n\u201cYou lot, stop pointing your guns and start unloading the car. Sorry about that, everyone\u2019s a little on edge. Name\u2019s Henry. I own this place.\u201d He says.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Suzy, and I get it.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are two pretty young girls doing driving around in this mess?\u201d\n\u201cLong story, but I\u2019ll just say, my sister and I are grateful for the shelter if only for awhile.\u201d\n\u201cHm, think nothing of it. Really though, if you two are willing to pull yer weight around here, yer welcome to stay as long as you like. Right now we\u2019ve got plenty of supplies and whatever useful supplies you have can be considered payment for your way in here.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly an offer to think about, but I\u2019m not exactly sure what we\u2019d do around here.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWe can find something I\u2019m sure. Anyway, I just mention it because I\u2019ve been trying to contact various places on my Ham Radio, and all I can gather is what\u2019s been going on is pretty serious and I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any place I could direct you where to go that would be as safe as this place right now. Security City is completely overrun and the closest military Fort around here, Fort Timons doesn\u2019t even know what the fuck is going on other than the obvious. Besides, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get in there anyway, not being military and all.\u201d\n\u201cThis place is really safe huh?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell not to brag, but we just fended off a big horde of those rabid freak things that I imagine wandered from the city yesterday. Didn\u2019t even lose anyone either. Wasn\u2019t fun though and I\u2019m glad no more of those things have popped up, but yeah, I think we\u2019re doing good job of keeping this place safe. Anyway, you\u2019re good to stay for the night, unless you let me know you want to stick around longer and we\u2019ll find something for the both of you to do. Okay, I\u2019m going to go make sure these boys don\u2019t take EVERYTHING of yours in that car.\u201d Henry says and then walks over to oversee his people unloading your car.\n\nWell it\u2019s a similar situation you had in the trailer park. Pull your weight or get the hell out. Funny how that worked out.\n\nMaybe you could try to do the \u201ccommunity\u201d thing again. The trailer park wasn\u2019t exactly filled with welcoming people, maybe things here could be different and you could actually feel safe here. This place does seem a little better organized and definitely better defended. Really, the only reason why you left the trailer park to begin with was at the insistence of your sister and the fact that it was getting pretty dangerous there.\n\nThen again, this place could turn out to be just as bad where you don\u2019t get along with anyone and everything eventually turns into a cluster fuck. Maybe you might as well save yourself the bother by leaving tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make long term plans", "result": "While this place might very well not work out, you decide you need to at least make a go of it. Given that you turned to murder and banditry fairly quickly you think you need some semblance of law and order to keep yourself from becoming a complete savage, but more importantly you think Donna needs this more than you do.\n\nThis whole week, Donna\u2019s been flip flopping a bit on the whole \u201ctrying to get her life together\u201d thing. Granted she hasn\u2019t had a great foundation, but if you stay on the road and just drift, about the only thing she\u2019s ever going to be useful for is\u2026well bait for whomever else you decide to rob in the future.\n\n\u201cHey Donna, I think we should stay here and by that I mean try to do what we were doing in the trailer park until we ran out like a pair of thieves.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you know that place wasn\u2019t turning out good for us.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, that\u2019s why I ultimately agreed with your plan to leave it\u2026but I can\u2019t help think that if we\u2019d done things a little differently\u2026well doesn\u2019t matter. My point is, I think we BOTH need some structure.\u201d\n\u201cStructure? You\u2019re joking right?\u201d\n\nAt this point you grab Donna by the arm and go to speak to her away from the earshot of those nearby.\n\n\u201cNo Donna, I\u2019m not fucking joking. Thursday, we stole a truck and killed two people who were just trying to stop us. Earlier today, we basically did the same thing except it was premeditated. You see a pattern emerging?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean to run over that woman at the trailer park and I didn\u2019t know you were going to kill those two guys with the car.\u201d\n\u201cDonna, don\u2019t play the babe in the woods routine. Granted I\u2019LL take the blame for murdering those guys in cold blood, but you knew damn well that it was a possibility. You went along with it.\u201d\n\u201cI went along with it, because you were practically shoving me in the road, telling me to strip to get those guys attention in the first place. It wasn\u2019t YOU who had to role-play a pig on a spit to distract them. Besides, we had to do it for survival.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s my point. First we\u2019re doing it for survival, how long before we start doing it for fun? I mean\u2026(Sigh) I don\u2019t know about you, but for the past few days, my mind has been going to a dark place. Quite frankly a place I didn\u2019t think I had. I mean I\u2019ve killed several people at this point and I don\u2019t feel particularly bad about it. Like I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\n\u201cGeez, Suzy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m apparently more fucked up than I ever realized, but what about you? I mean you\u2019ve relied on your looks and sex to get what you want for the most part. Do you really think that\u2019s a great way to go through life? I even used you as slut bait so we could rip off someone a lot easier. Hell, I pretty much pimped you out and I think it\u2019s the only thing fucked up thing I\u2019ve done recently that I HAVE actually felt bad about doing on some level. You shouldn\u2019t have to be taking random dicks in the ass and mouth just so we can get by. And I\u2019m really sorry for that. We both NEED a better plan for our future and drifting from place to place isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nDonna\u2019s silent for a moment.\n\n\u201cBut what would we do here? How would we contribute?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, but I\u2019m going to go talk to that Henry guy about it.\u201d You say and then head over back to Henry who is overseeing his people taking all the shit out of your car.\n\n\u201cOh hey there\u2026Suzy wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Henry remarks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell Suzy, you\u2019ll be happy to know we haven\u2019t taken much, save for the couple of first aid kits you had. We got tons of food and water, so we really didn\u2019t need any of that. Oh, didn\u2019t take your weapons either. Got enough of those too.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026thanks, but I wanted to talk to you about staying.\u201d\n\u201cGood, we could use the help, so what skills do you have?\u201d Henry asks.\n\u201cWell, I killed a lot of those cannibal freaks. I also had to kill a few regular psychos as well this week. Guess you could say I\u2019ve become a fast learner in the ways of the gun\u2026so do you need another lookout?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t turn one down if you\u2019re feeling up to the task. Not many here actually want to do it. Anyway, I\u2019ll make sure to get you a rifle, but what about your sister? What\u2019s she do?\u201d\n\nBefore you can answer, your sister Donna has come up to speak for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a people person! I used to plan parties and other similar social events. Made sure people had a good time. Now while that might not sound very useful, I think given our current situation it could be. I mean I can\u2019t imagine spirits around here are very high. And when spirits aren\u2019t very high, everything else goes to shit. I think I could help out in making sure people stay positive.\u201d Donna says with a chipper tone and a smile.\n\nHenry scratches his head and returns a brief grin.\n\n\u201cWell now, that is an interesting proposal and I have to say you do have a pretty cheery attitude. You\u2019re right in that everyone has been on edge and not in the best of moods. I\u2019m really not sure how you propose to change that, but if you can do it, well that would be pretty helpful. Though you\u2019re still going to have to do something else in the meantime, I think the wait staff in the diner needs help with going through the inventory. Go see Anne in the diner; she\u2019ll be able to direct you. Okay, well that\u2019s settled. You ready for your assignment Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, hold on. Just want to talk to my sister for a moment.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\nOnce again you take Donna aside away from earshot.\n\n\u201cDonna, what was all that about planning parties and shit?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat? I did used to plan parties over Julie\u2019s house remember?\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you guys actually planned them so much as you just invited a bunch of people over.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, yeah most of the time that was the case, but really I was the main one that got those parties going to be more exciting than they actually were. I also curbed the more destructive elements that actually occurred at those things by keeping people positive and happy.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what? You\u2019re going to turn this place into a rave orgy?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026well I mean I wish, but all I have to do is take my interpersonal skills and channel them in some way that will work here. Look, you said we need to try to start over. Well, I\u2019m going to improvise with what I can so we can make a go of it here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Donna. Okay, well I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nBefore you leave, Donna moves in to hug you. You weren\u2019t expecting it, but you return the hug.\n\n\u201cBe careful Suzy, don\u2019t get eaten.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, you just focus on what you need to do.\u201d You say.\n\nWith those parting words, Donna heads towards the diner and you go back to Henry for your assignment.\n\nHenry apparently has already told some of his people that you\u2019ll be joining them on the truck tops keeping a look out and hands you a rifle. Henry also mentions that this decision was met with mixed results. Some were happy since it meant they could take more breaks, others didn\u2019t like the idea since nobody really knows who the fuck you are and don\u2019t see why they should trust you yet. Still, Henry is pretty well respected you guess around here, because other than some grumbling nobody is outright making a major case out of it.\n\nHenry takes you to the far back end of the truck stop. He says he hasn\u2019t really put many guards up here since its away from the road and borders the wilderness and so far nothing has come out from there yet, other than the occasional wildlife.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t think anything actually will be coming up this way, since I imagine if we did have another cannibal attack they\u2019ll be coming from one of the other directions, but hey we shouldn\u2019t just keep our back completely undefended. Now you\u2019ll be here until about midnight, I hope you\u2019re up for that.\u201d Henry remarks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well like I said, there probably won\u2019t be much going on and about the most likely thing you\u2019re going to have to fight off is boredom. Um, if you need to go bathroom, there are some port a johns nearby, though suppose if you REALLY need to, you can go run over to the diner if you\u2019re a little more concerned with cleanliness, but whatever you do make sure you at least tell Larry over there so he can keep extra watch while you\u2019re gone.\u201d Henry points to a man over on top of a truck on the far side of where you are before continuing.\n\n\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s about it, and if you see anything that looks dangerous, yell your head off and warn us.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, got it.\u201d You answer.\n\nYou climb up the ladder propped against the eighteen-wheeler and take you place as a guard.\n\nA few hours pass and just as predicted, nothing happens. You\u2019re not really bored yet though since you\u2019re taking a mental count of the number of rabbits you see hopping around in the field and making up little bunny names and little stories about their little bunny lives.\n\nEvery once in awhile while you\u2019re walking back and forth along the truck, you wonder how your sister is doing. You also wave to Larry once in an attempt to be friendly, but he doesn\u2019t return the wave and ignores you.\n\nEventually he has to pay attention when nature calls.\n\n\u201cHey Larry!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d he answers in an annoyed tone.\n\u201cI gotta pee!\u201d\n\u201cSo? Go over the side of the truck, its what I do when I gotta piss.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not a guy and I don\u2019t have the luxury of the world being my toilet. I need to use a proper bathroom. Henry told me to let you know so you can keep an extra eye on things until I get back.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine, don\u2019t fucking take all day though.\u201d\n\nWith Larry\u2019s acknowledgement of your bathroom needs, you go down the ladder and run to the diner. (You sure as hell aren\u2019t going to use those disgusting port a johns)\n\nWhen you enter the diner, you find a variety of people singing songs and joking around. You then see Donna dressed in a waitress uniform wave to you.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy! You done with protecting all of us?! This is my sister Suzy folks! She\u2019s the one that saved my life more than once this week!\u201d\n\nAt this point everyone says hi to you.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026hey. I actually just came in to use the bathroom\u201d You reply caught a little off guard.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Suzy, always the social one.\u201d Donna laughs and then goes back to talking to the crowd.\n\nAfter taking care of business in the bathroom, you wash your hands and see Donna entering the room.\n\n\u201cGotta hand it to you Donna, it hasn\u2019t been a few hours and already you\u2019ve got the people here in a good mood.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes, and I didn\u2019t fuck all of them to get them that way in case that\u2019s what you were thinking.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cSheesh, I saw some children out there. I know you\u2019re not a degenerate Donna.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t think I am. Never thought I\u2019d say this, but your opinion of me has started to matter more this week. So how\u2019s guard duty?\u201d\n\u201cIt is what it is. I\u2019m not quite the people person you are though, so all I\u2019ve managed to do is piss off the one person assigned near me. On the bright side, I\u2019ve managed to stave off boredom by making up stories in my head about the bunnies bouncing around in the fields.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well you always were the imaginative one. Well I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nYou leave your sister and return to your guard duty, which continues to be uneventful. As the night comes your stories about rabbits give way to stories about wandering possums and raccoons instead. Thankfully no cannibals though.\n\nEventually someone comes to relieve you of duty. Some guy you haven\u2019t seen before, but at least he\u2019s a little more cordial than Larry.\n\nYou return to the diner where you find most people now asleep. Donna is still awake and sitting behind the food counter playing solitaire. She waves you over.\n\n\u201cSuzy, there you are. I waited up for you so I could show you where we\u2019ll be sleeping. Come on.\u201d Donna whispers and takes you through the back kitchen.\n\n\u201cHey you didn\u2019t eat today did you? There\u2019s a lot of food here you know. There\u2019s also a shower in the waitresses\u2019 private bathroom if you need.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m good for now. I\u2019ll worry about that stuff tomorrow.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOkay, well here it is.\u201d Donna says and opens up a small storeroom, which doesn\u2019t have much space.\n\n\u201cI tried to make it as comfortable as possible with a few blankets I borrowed. There are our bags of clothing. I figured those might work as pillows of a sort.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cWell I guess it will have to do.\u201d You answer.\n\nYou lay down on the make shift bed on the floor and try to get as comfortable as possible. Donna does likewise and you drift off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body spooning you, and an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section.\n\n\u201cDonna! Hey! Wake the fuck up!\u201d you shout pushing your sister off of you.\n\u201cHuh? Wha? The hell are you pushing and hitting me for?\u201d she exclaims groggily.\n\u201cBecause you were about to commit incest that\u2019s why!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cOh. Sorry. It wasn\u2019t intentional I assure you. I probably was dreaming about Julie.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cWell one time over her house her heating system broke down and we had to sleep together for warmth for a week.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want to know anymore about your little lesbian encounters with Julie.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh geez Suzy don\u2019t be so heteronormative, we weren\u2019t lesbians. We just had some fun on occasion. (Sigh) I wish she was here with us.\u201d Donna says getting a little tearful.\n\nYou pat Donna on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cI wish she was here too Donna.\u201d You say.\n\nAfter that moment of silence to remember your friend, the both of you get up.\n\n\u201cYou know what time it is?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cNo, but I know it\u2019s time for me to take a shower. You said I can use the waitresses\u2019 private one?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah, but you might have to wait for other people.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, speaking of waitresses, what\u2019s with the uniform?\u201d\n\u201cOh this? Well I needed to change my clothes yesterday and I was offered one of their uniforms. I figured I\u2019d wear it to fit in a little better, besides its kind of cute don\u2019t you think?\u201d Donna asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of stripperish if you ask me. The skirt barely covers your ass.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cWell I think that\u2019s the point. This is a truck stop remember and they probably want the waitresses to look a little more on the sexy side.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I\u2019ll stick with my old non-stripper clothes.\u201d\n\u201cPrude.\u201d Donna snarks.\n\nAs you and Donna leave the storage room to start the new day you both suddenly hear a loud noise and a faint rumble. You then hear some screams and shouting from the front of the diner.\n\n\u201cOh my god that was a fucking nuke!\u201d you hear someone shout.\n\nYou and Donna just look at each other. Maybe its due to the week you\u2019ve had, you\u2019re not entirely phased by this.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) I guess they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cPerfect way to start the day.\u201d Donna replies and the pair of you head to the front of the diner.\n\nWhen you get there, you see a waitress trying to calm her children down. A couple people are arguing. A few are just sitting in a silent state of shock. Henry is actually outside the diner looking in the direction of where the bomb must\u2019ve gone off. You can see the lingering remnants of a mushroom cloud in the far distance even from inside the diner.\n\n\u201cWell I can only hope we\u2019re far enough away that we aren\u2019t suffering from horrible radioactive fallout.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose not much can be done now if we are, just um\u2026shoot me if my hair starts falling out okay?\u201d Donna asks.\n\nYou briefly wonder if this bomb was the result of the nuclear war those Ground Zero ads kept harping on about or if this was just some internal thing to take care of those rabid people.\n\nEither way, you suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter, life is going to be severely different from now on.\n\nAt this point Henry steps back in the diner and after calming some of the arguing truckers. He begins addressing the situation and stating that nothing has changed and that the situation is still the same, namely if people help, then they are welcome to stay. If not or if they don\u2019t want to stay then they are free to go.\n\nA couple of the truckers who apparently have families elsewhere do leave. Everyone else stays and the work towards creating a permanent new \u201chome\u201d is begun.\n\nAfter washing up and having something to eat, you head out to do your guard duty rounds. Donna comes to see you before you leave.\n\n\u201cHey, Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWhatever happens next, I just want to say\u2026I\u2019m glad we\u2019re dealing with all this together.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re seeing this through together too.\u201d You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you and Donna hug and go contribute in your various jobs in this new community.\n\nFunny that it took the collapse of society before you re-connected with your family again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Sisterhood\n\n\nThe future\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, those trailer park rednecks had been fucking assholes to us for years. It was high time that we burned that whole heap of trash to the ground like it deserved. It\u2019s just too bad we couldn\u2019t do it when we were temporarily stuck in that hell hole.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cYeah, I know I just sort of wish there had been another way to deal with them. Wiping out entire communities isn\u2019t really something that is particularly popular you know. I mean there were children and other innocents there too.\u201d Donna says.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why we can blame that shit on the Cult of Tiamat. They\u2019re the crazies that took things too far, or whatever\u2026I dunno, you know how to spin this shit, you\u2019re the politician not me.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, the alliance with the cultists. That\u2019s going to be an easy spin\u2026(Sigh) I can\u2019t believe you convinced me THAT was a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cHey look, if we had gone head to head with those trailer park assholes by ourselves, it would\u2019ve been a bloodbath for us. Considering the cult was also their enemy, it was a good opportunity to re-establish an old contact as it were. Besides, Bobby\u2019s bitch of a sister Diana wasn\u2019t around anymore so I knew I\u2019d have more clout. Not to mention we\u2019ve got a peace agreement with them now so that\u2019s TWO less enemies in our immediate area now.\u201d\n\nDonna gets up from her desk and pours herself a drink. She downs the whole glass in one gulp and pours another shot.\n\nIt\u2019s funny; she used to drink for enjoyment at one time. Nowadays she drinks to keep herself from being overwhelmed with all the shit she has to deal with. That party girl is long gone and when she took over New Security from Henry she disappeared completely.\n\nPopularity was always her specialty, but you\u2019ve always been the stronger one. Without you Donna probably would\u2019ve failed at this community leader thing a long time ago.\n\nOf course without Donna, you probably would\u2019ve gotten lynched by an angry mob a long time ago. That \u201cgood girl\u201d that once hid out in the basement is long gone too. While you didn\u2019t become the \u201coutlaw savage\u201d that you worried about becoming, you still lost that \u201ccivility\u201d and over the years as you had to deal with shitty things in this shitty new world, well it was just easier to be the cold bitch that would kill someone without hesitation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re a team.\n\n\u201cSo Suzy. You and Bobby rekindle something?\u201d Donna asks putting down her glass.\n\u201cHah, no. Bobby\u2019s one true love nowadays is his blessed Tiamat. Followed by his sister Helen. Still, it doesn\u2019t hurt that I was an ex that I imagine he still has the occasional fond memory.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he\u2019ll leave us be?\u201d\n\u201cSure. I mean we\u2019ll always keep an eye on his group, but now that those rednecks are gone, more territory has opened up for Bobby. He\u2019ll be satisfied in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026(Sigh) ugh, I don\u2019t feel like going out there and giving a fucking speech right now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re stressing about this, but I promise you the people of this town aren\u2019t really going to be that upset by the destruction of a bunch of hostile trailer trash. Some of them will probably throw a party. This isn\u2019t the old world anymore where you got the U.N. or some shit waggling their finger at you for war crimes. People are back to the mindset that their tight knit communities come first and fuck everyone else. Besides even if you do have some idealistic fools screaming about injustice or some shit, you\u2019ve still got the support of our militia of which I am currently head of.

This place isn\u2019t like the trailer park. We won\u2019t be able to get out so easily.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to case this place. Or rather I\u2019M going to case this place and YOU are going make friendly with the guards.\u201d\n\nDonna looks at you like \u201creally?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? You said I had my talents and you had yours. You know the drill.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I guess. Teamwork and all that\u2026whatever.

Decided we\u2019re only going to stay the night Henry. We\u2019ve got family in another county and we should at least try to reach them to see if they\u2019re okay.\u201d You lie.\n\u201cWell I can understand that\u2026hmmm. Tell ya what; you can keep everything in your car. Actually we were just going to take the first aid kits, but I was sort of hoping you\u2019d stick around to help out. Since you aren\u2019t I don\u2019t think it would be right for us to take what little medical supplies you do have. Especially since you\u2019ll have a dangerous journey ahead.\u201d\n\nAt this point Henry motions one of his people carrying the medical kits to put them back in the car. And with this act of kindness, you think you see your opportunity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really generous Henry. Thank you. Hey is there any place we can wash up?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell there is a small shower in the waitresses\u2019 private bathroom. Just tell Anne I said you could use it. As for your sleeping arrangements, well I guess one of the booths or floor will have to do. Of course you could sleep in your car if you want.\u201d Henry replies.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s better than we could\u2019ve hoped for. Thanks again.\u201d\n\nAt this point you part ways with Henry and return to Donna.\n\n\u201cOkay, new plan. An hour from now I want you to grab one of those medical kits in the car and go see Henry. Tell him a story about how you really think we should pay to stay here and you insist that he take a kit.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you want me to fuck that old guy?\u201d\n\u201cWell if you have to, but I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s probably got a key to where he keeps all the medicine locked up. Find out where that is, steal the key and later on in the night we can raid it. Then when the morning comes we leave before anyone finds out.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno Suzy, that sounds pretty risky. In fact it sounds pretty dumb. Shouldn\u2019t we just, I dunno pilfer the kitchen during the night? Seems like it might be easier.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and there\u2019s going to be a shitload of people sleeping in that diner too. Talk about your dumb ideas.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t steal anything. I mean that old guy didn\u2019t even take our medkits as payment and is letting us stay here for free. I mean that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fuck Donna, how the hell are you ever going to survive in this world if you don\u2019t seize opportunity when you see it? Fine, you know what, fuck the plan. Why don\u2019t you just go blow as many guys as you can and hand me what you manage to steal off of them okay? That seems like it might be your speed.\u201d You say angrily and begin to walk away.\n\nHowever you\u2019ve pushed Donna a little too far this time and she pushes back, literally when you feel a heavy shove causing you to nearly fall over.\n\n\u201cOh fuck you Suzy! FUCK YOU! You think you can look down upon me like I\u2019m some sort of gutter whore? You\u2019re no fucking better than I am!

You aren\u2019t really listening though, it\u2019s like your mind is going to a different place. A dark place that\u2019s telling you to shut her whore mouth shut.\n\nAnd so you act upon this feeling and pull your pistol shooting Donna.\n\nAt first she looks down at her body wound and then back at you in shock. There are no last words she just falls backwards dead.\n\nYou stand there for a moment in a little disbelief of what you\u2019ve done. You look at your pistol and then Donna\u2019s body.

(Sigh) Well, at this point I guess I\u2019ve got no choice, but to stay too. I mean I think it\u2019s pretty obvious by now that I can\u2019t go it alone. I\u2019m just not adapting well to this series of events like you seem to be.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cI dunno if I\u2019m adapting or just so overwhelmed by what\u2019s been going on this week that I\u2019m just going with what my instincts are.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re a far cry from the wallflower you were.\u201d Your sister says.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose, but I\u2019d actually rather be on my couch in the basement back home.\u201d\n\u201cAt this point, I\u2019d rather be on that couch right next to you.\u201d Donna laughs.\n\nYou and Donna leave Jimmy Ray\u2019s trailer and head back to yours.

I told him that right now he should focus on rebuilding the barricades around this place. I mean yeah I know more medical supplies would be useful, but really we got enough to get by for now and for those that got all bit up\u2026well\u2026\u201d Tina trails off, but you know what she\u2019s getting at.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026think we should kill them?\u201d Mary Lou asks, shoving her own meat hook in.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 that perhaps wastin\u2019 medicine on them isn\u2019t the best idea because they\u2019re probably goners anyway. I mean don\u2019t you think so? I mean those crazy fuckers biting people had to have been sick with something right? How do we know it isn\u2019t spread through biting or even worse just being close to \u2018em? At least Mel had the sense to put all those folks in one trailer though.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re having a little difficulty putting in your hook. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve done this before.\n\n\u201cYou need help there blondie? You\u2019re holding us up.\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cNo, I\u2026got it. There.\u201d You say as the hook sinks in.\n\u201cOkay, lift everyone.\u201d Tina says and all four of you do so. Billie\u2019s probably doing the majority of the work though.\n\nAs you carry/drag the body to the open field behind the trailer park, Billie continues the conversation.\n\n\u201cWell I admit, them possibly bein\u2019 infected is a concern for me too, but I\u2019m sort of surprised Mel didn\u2019t shoot them just to be safe, I mean we all know he isn\u2019t excessively compassionate.\u201d Billie remarks.\n\nTina laughs a bit.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s true, in fact I almost guarantee if they were anyone else he might\u2019ve just done that, but one of Mel\u2019s few endearing traits is he\u2019s got a sense of loyalty. And I know he feels like he should at least try to help those that watched his back during the recent battle. Not to mention he is drinking buddies with most of \u2018em, despite the fact he doesn\u2019t think very highly of \u2018em. Oh well, hopefully he\u2019ll be successful with his trip.\u201d\n\nYou almost ask, but then stop yourself. Tina however has already noticed your stifled attempt at continuing the conversation.\n\n\u201cIf you got somethin\u2019 to say blondie, say it.\u201d Tina remarks.\n\u201cWell, I was just gonna ask, do you think he\u2019ll even come back?\u201d\n\u201cShit blondie, that\u2019s a pretty fuckin\u2019 grim ass question. And if I were anyone else I\u2019d probably be pretty upset by the implications, but I\u2019m not worried about Mel. He\u2019ll get back here some how. Everyone else might be dead, but I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\u201cHey didn\u2019t Jimmy Ray go with them? I hope he comes back too!\u201d Mary Lou remarks.\n\u201cHeh, guess you\u2019re a little late on the update there Mary, but blondie\u2019s sister Donna currently has her own hooks in Jimmy right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!? That asshole told me how I was the only one for him last week!\u201d Mary Lou exclaims. \u201cHey blondie, tell your homewreckin\u2019 cunt of a sister to keep her hands off my man!\u201d\n\nYou briefly wonder why Mary Lou who also having blonde hair is calling you blondie. (Granted hers is out of a bottle unlike your natural magnificence)\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll pass it on to her.\u201d You remark apathetically.\n\nAt this point you reach your destination where a few other bodies have been placed and the four of you unhook the body and make your way back to the park to presumably get another body.\n\n\u201cHey, Suzy isn\u2019t it?\u201d Billie suddenly pipes up.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you ask turning your head a bit to look at Billie who is walking behind you.\n\u201cDo you have an older sister by the name of Kelly who participates in the fight clubs in town?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do. How did you know?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBecause in the locker room she used to constantly bitch about having a pretty blonde sister by the name of Suzy that didn\u2019t do shit around the house and another one by the name of Donna that was a complete whore. I took a shot in the dark that you and this Donna were the same ones that might be related to her.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well you got it right. Wow, didn\u2019t realize she complained about us at\u2026her work.\u201d\n\u201cEh, she mostly complained about you. I mean ALL the fuckin\u2019 time. Most of us were sick to death of hearing her bitch. So where is Kelly anyway?\u201d\n\u201cDunno. Don\u2019t really care either. Knowing her she\u2019s probably surviving this bullshit somehow though. Were you and her an item or something?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cFuck no! I hated that cunt. That bitch knocked out three of my teeth in our last match! I almost had her, but I know that cunt spiked my drink with something before the match! Anyway she was straight, but I figured you knew that.\u201d\n\u201cHm, sort of surprising. Just figured she was a lesbian. My whole family did actually.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNah, she tried to get with so many of the guys at the fight club it was actually kind of pathetic. She actually would\u2019ve been a whore like your sister Donna had she actually been successful. As it stands she was more like a rapist since she\u2019d routinely intimidate some of the scrawny audience members into having sex with her.\u201d\n\nThis revelation about Kelly is pretty interesting, but you don\u2019t think you need to know too much more.\n\n\u201cYikes, is all I got to say about that.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, but I will say this, her physical description of you doesn\u2019t do you justice. You\u2019re much prettier.\u201d Billie says and them smiles with a couple of missing teeth.\n\nYou turn your head back away and close your eyes in horror at such a thought. Tina glances over at you and smirks.\n\n\u201cKinda disturbin\u2019 to think she\u2019s been starin at yer ass this whole time isn\u2019t it blondie?\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s not true, I\u2019ve been starin\u2019 at yours as well.\u201d Billie laughs.\n\u201cPfft, honey, EVERYONE stares at my fuckin\u2019 ass.\u201d Tina says puffing up slightly in pride.\n\nWhen you get back to the trailer park, Mel and the rest have already returned. In the distance you see him slamming his truck door and hear him swearing.\n\n\u201cI guess it didn\u2019t go well. (Sigh) Let me go see what happened. As for the rest of these bodies, you can keep moving them if y\u2019all want, but as far as I\u2019m concerned Mel and whoever survived their trip can do it instead. I\u2019m done with this mess.\u201d\n\nAt this point Tina leaves and seeing as you don\u2019t particularly want to move any more bodies you head back to your trailer. Eventually you arrive and collapse on your sofa.\n\n\u201cSuzy?\u201d Donna asks coming from out of her room.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Man, I\u2019m tired. I think the stress of the day is really catching up to me. Oh Mel\u2019s back, guess it didn\u2019t go as planned if he\u2019s back already.\u201d\n\u201cIs Jimmy Ray with him?\u201d\n\u201cDunno, I just saw Mel getting out of his truck and cussing up a storm.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go check. Hope so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, weren\u2019t you just ready to rob the guy blind a moment ago?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell that was a different situation. I mean if we\u2019re going to stay here, it\u2019s best I latch on to the best looking guy here right? Isn\u2019t that what you said?\u201d\n\u201cActually I said becoming self-sufficient, but I suppose grabbing one of the guys so you\u2019re only sleeping with one as opposed to several works too. Well good luck. Oh there\u2019s a girl with a bad bleached blonde job by the name of Mary Lou that\u2019s got her eyes on him, so you might have some competition.\u201d\n\u201cPfft. They haven\u2019t made anyone that can compete with me. Let alone around here. I mean come on, it\u2019s not even a contest.\u201d Donna remarks.\n\u201cWell glad to see your confidence still remains strong in all this. Have fun and be careful. I\u2019m going to get some rest.\u201d\n\nAnd with that you leave Donna to her own devices and turn over on your side to get some sleep.

Goddamnit, I\u2019m up! I\u2019m up!\u201d you say and go to the door.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you ask though Mel doesn\u2019t look too happy that you\u2019re even asking that question.\n\u201cWhat? Whadda ya mean what? Yer fuckin\u2019 sister and that cowardly motherfucker Jimmy Ray just skedaddled outta here with a perfectly good truck that was also actin as a temporary barrier! That\u2019s what!\u201d\n\nThis remark isn\u2019t quite comprehended by you in your current groggy state.\n\n\u201cMy sister fucked Jimmy Ray in his truck and what?\u201d you say.\n\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019\u2026I said\u2026bah, I\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 repeatin\u2019 myself! Shit!\u201d Mel shouts and walks away banging on the door one more time. You briefly step outside and see Tina standing nearby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessin\u2019 you didn\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about it anyway considering you\u2019re still here.\u201d Tina remarks.\n\u201cOkay, someone tell me again what happened? What about my sister and Jimmy Ray now?\u201d\n\u201cApparently your sister convinced Jimmy Ray to leave this place in the middle of the night. Guess she really laid it down good, but then Jimmy Ray\u2019s always had a tendency to get stupid over a gal who knows how to work it.\u201d\n\u201cWait. Wait. Wait a minute she\u2019s gone?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s fuckin\u2019 gone with a perfectly good truck! I actually don\u2019t even give a shit about Jimmy Ray, he was more useless than tits on bull, but we could\u2019ve used that fuckin\u2019 truck for\u2026\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake Mel, we got a shitload of trucks here and aren\u2019t you converting those army trucks into some sort of road warrior deathmobile anyway?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s the fuckin\u2019 principle of the thing! Not to mention we still gotta find some medical supplies! Goddamnit, Dan was supposed to be keepin\u2019 a look out and\u2026\u201d\n\nYou leave Mel to rant and head back inside trying to process this new information. You can\u2019t believe that Donna would just leave you like that. There was no indication she was going to just take off like that.\n\nYou check her bedroom and see that her bag is gone. You don\u2019t know if she took that just after you fell asleep, or if she came back for it before leaving or what. Was she planning it right from the start or did she just see the opportunity? None of it matters you suppose, she just ditched you and didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to let you know.\n\nSo much for \u201csisterhood.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019re thinking about this, someone enters the trailer and calls out to you. It\u2019s Tina.\n\n\u201cOh there you are. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re pretty upset right now, but I found this in Jimmy\u2019s trailer. Figured you should have it.\u201d Tina says and hands you a note.\n\nDear Suzy,\n\nSorry, I just couldn\u2019t stick around. Good luck to you in this shithole.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDonna\n\nYou actually chuckle a bit and crumple up the note.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny.\u201d Tina asks.\n\u201cOh just thinking that she was the one that convinced me to come here in the first place. Anyway, it\u2019s done and she\u2019s gone. We were never really close to begin with, though I thought that was sort of changing this week, but I guess not. Still, at least it felt like someone was on my side. I imagine I\u2019m not too well accepted around here.\u201d\n\u201cMeh, I think you\u2019re about as accepted as anyone else around here. I mean I think the general assessment of you is that you\u2019re a big tease that thinks she\u2019s better than everyone else, but I mean its not like you\u2019re a nigger or something.\u201d Tina remarks.\n\nYou give Tina a strange look.\n\n\u201cUm, lucky me then I guess. Just out of curiosity what do you think about Donna leaving? She kept going on about how you two were friends.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMe? Eh, I don\u2019t really care. I mean I knew your sister on and off for a few years when I use to do strip jobs over at the parties at the place she was livin\u2019 at before. An while she was a funny girl that made that particular job a lot more enjoyable, so I didn\u2019t mind helping her out with a job when she asked, but it wasn\u2019t like I ever considered her a real friend. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know she had a sister until a few days ago. Anyway, always knew she was flakey. To be honest I didn\u2019t even see her lasting long as a stripper and living here either. She probably would\u2019ve latched on to first sugar daddy she could find and ditched everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds about right.\u201d You say and toss aside the note.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll leave you alone blondie. And I wouldn\u2019t worry about your status here or lack there of. Quite frankly so many folks here have died or are wounded that nobody\u2019s really in any position to antagonize someone who actually has been making an effort to contribute around here. Speakin\u2019 of which I need to go talk to this crazy man that\u2019s probably still ranting about a fuckin\u2019 truck.\u201d Tina says and leaves.\n\nYou take a shower as you\u2019re thinking about how you\u2019re going to proceed next. You go back and forth on whether to do what your sister did, but knowing your luck, you\u2019d end up getting caught so you ultimately abandon the idea.\n\nAs you\u2019re getting dressed and figuring out what your next plan of action should be, you suddenly hear banging on the door of your trailer again. You go to the door and see it\u2019s that methhead Dan.\n\n\u201cHey blondie! You\u2019re needed for a vote!\u201d Dan exclaims.\n\u201cVote? Vote for what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe need a tie breaker to shoot the ones that got bitten or not. Billy Ray in particular ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 too good.\u201d Dan remarks.\n\u201cSo what are we doin\u2019 if we don\u2019t shoot \u2018em?\u201d\n\u201cGuess we\u2019re goin\u2019 back to town to try for medical supplies again. If that\u2019s the case, I hope we have better luck, cause it was a cluster fuck last time.\u201d Dan says.\n\nAs you walk with Dan, he\u2019s looking at you a lot and while some of that is predictable ogling, he\u2019s also doing a lot of twitching and it\u2019s making you nervous.\n\n\u201cDan, I know you have to take a glance at me every now and then, but between the staring and the twitching it\u2019s making me uncomfortable. Makes me think of those things that attacked us yesterday. It doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re about as clean as they were too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Sorry blondie. I just\u2026I need a fuckin\u2019 fix. Just to put me at ease. The shit that\u2019s been going down for the past couple of days has really made me scared y\u2019know? I went through most of my shit after the National Guard showed up and then I used the rest up immediately after the freak invasion.\u201d\n\u201cSo where\u2019s the meth lab? Don\u2019t places like this usually have one?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHah, I wish. I mean we used to have one years ago, but it blew up and caused a lot of damage. After that, the old owner sort of cracked down on that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no law anymore, you could just start making it again.\u201d\n\u201cHah, yeah. But again with everythin\u2019 that\u2019s gone on, isn\u2019t like there\u2019s been time to do that. Not to mention Mel\u2019s been ridin\u2019 everyone non-stop. He\u2019s already pissed at me for fallin\u2019 asleep yesterday. I didn\u2019t catch Jimmy Ray an\u2019 yer sister taking off in the night. Guess he figured if anyone would stay awake all night it would be me, but I just sort of crashed because like I said I didn\u2019t have my shit anymore to keep me alert.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s tough all over.\u201d You say unsympathetically.\n\nBefore you even get to the meeting, you can hear the arguing, which is mainly consisting of a lot of shouting and swearing. By the time you arrive, you\u2019re met with mixed glances.\n\n\u201cThese are our friends, we can\u2019t just fuckin\u2019 kill them!\u201d\n\u201cWe need to fuckin\u2019 kill \u2018em before they infect us all!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one cold hearted sonofbitch you know that? What if I just decided to kill you?!\u201d\n\u201cTry it bitch!\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP ALL OF YOU!\u201d Mel shouts.\n\nAt this point all eyes are on you.\n\n\u201cAs you can see blondie, we\u2019re involved in the democratic process and are in need of a tie breaker.\u201d Mel says to you.\n\u201cAw Mel what the fuck we need her vote for? She ain\u2019t one of us and her sister fucking stole a truck!\u201d some redneck woman says.\n\u201cI said shut it! The only reason why I even entertained this process is so you fuckers would quit bitchin\u2019 about me bein\u2019 a so-called tyrant even though I\u2019m the only one around he trying to do anything at all! So however blondie votes, will break the goddamn tie and we can move on. So what\u2019s your vote?\u201d\n\nNot that you\u2019re especially close to any of these people, but if you vote to shoot you know it\u2019s going to cause a lot more problems and you being an \u201coutsider\u201d are going to catch all the hell for it. Besides, last you remember Mel was trying to keep these folks alive, best you vote on his side.\n\n\u201cWell I vote not to shoot because\u2026\u201d you start to say before Mel interrupts again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to know. Didn\u2019t need the reasons. Hear that folks? We ain\u2019t shootin\u2019 any of them! I dunno why you pussies are scared anyway, we got \u2018em all locked up and barricaded inside a trailer. They ain\u2019t getting out even if they do turn into something.\u201d\n\nAt this point there is more grumbling, but democracy has won this day and nobody gets violent about it, though you have a question.\n\n\u201cUm, has anyone actually looked in on these bitten folks since they got thrown in together?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, I did. Like I said, Billy Ray ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 too good. Neither are some of the others. They\u2019re all mostly just lying there not doing much though.\u201d Dan says.\n\u201cWell was any first aid actually applied to them? I mean maybe they\u2019re not infected, but just really wounded. Any aid might help.\u201d\n\u201cI threw in some bottles of whiskey an\u2019 pain killers to ease the discomfort. I threw in some bandages in there, but I wasn\u2019t gonna get close enough to actually bandage them.\u201d Dan replies.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it? Nobody else has seen to them since they\u2019ve been shoved in a trailer?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\nThis is nuts, these people that have been bitten could very well be DYING due to neglect more than anything else! Nevermind the fact that the reason some might not be moving is that they might\u2019ve very well ODed from the alcohol/pill combo.\n\nIn any event Mel breaks up your question period.\n\n\u201cAlright what we\u2019re gonna do is fetch us some more medical supplies an whatever else we might find. Thinkin\u2019 we should hit up that carnival a few miles from here.\u201d Mel remarks which sort of takes most by surprise. You especially since you weren\u2019t even aware there was a carnival in the area.\n\n\u201cIf the National Guard stopped here, chances are good they stopped at that carnival too. Maybe that detachment had more supplies and I also figure it\u2019s gotta be easier than tryin\u2019 to go back into town again.\u201d Mel reasons.\n\nMel\u2019s suggestion is met with mixed results, but the people seem to be okay with it. Probably because a carnival does sound a lot less dangerous than going back into town, which they assumed would be the case.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re taking three trucks an\u2019 y\u2019all that came with me last time are comin\u2019 with me this time as well an I\u2019ll be pickin\u2019 a few more so don\u2019t nobody go too far. That means you blondie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if I stayed here and looked after things? I mean you don\u2019t want to leave this place totally undefended.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh it never is. I\u2019m sure you saw that everyone is fully capable of defendin\u2019 themselves here when those freaks attacked. But I can\u2019t just be takin\u2019 mothers ya know? I mean it\u2019s bad enough most of the snot nosed bastards round here that survived ain\u2019t got fathers and that\u2019s before all this shit went down. Can\u2019t hardly deprive \u2018em of mothers as well can I? Someone needs to keep \u2018em out of my way and look after them.\u201d\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t someone like Butchie Billie better suited for something like this than me?\u201d\n\u201cButchie Billie is probably our best welder and mechanic. I\u2019m not gonna risk taking her. Besides, she still needs to work on converting our newly acquired army trucks. And some of the other guys I\u2019m not takin\u2019 are better at workin\u2019 on the generators or digging some extra outhouses.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a weapon or least not any with ammo. I ran out of bullets during the last attack.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that, if there is one thing we\u2019ve got a lot of, its weapons and ammo.\u201d\n\nAs you struggle to think up another excuse. Mel stops you.\n\n\u201cLook blondie, you knew you were gonna have to start paying yer dues. And since I KNOW you were tryin\u2019 to avoid bein the new fuck toy around here, it\u2019s either this or you can just fuckin\u2019 leave.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t see yourself making it on your own\u2026at least not yet. You still need to be in the safety of numbers, so that means you\u2019re going.\n\nHowever you question if Mel\u2019s plan is even a good one. You could very well get to this carnival and not find anything, you sort of wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be a better idea to actually head back to town. You figure the town is probably already half looted and lawless by now, so you might well go in and get the best stuff you can before its completely gone. Not to mention you might know the town a little better as far as which side streets to take to get to certain locations quicker. Like say small pharmacies and other stores near where you live.\n\nOf course putting yourself in more danger isn\u2019t necessarily desirable either.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Mel\u2019s plan", "result": "No need to make this more dangerous than it needs to be.\n\n\u201cAlright I guess we\u2019re going to the carnival.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood. be ready at the trailer park entrance in a few minutes. Someone there can probably hand you a weapon as well.\u201d\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, a group of rednecks are already there checking various rifles and handguns. It really does look like they got enough to take on an army. Their attention turns to you.\n\n\u201cWell now if it isn\u2019t blondie. I\u2019m surprised Mel is riskin\u2019 his piece on the side like this.\u201d One of the sleazier rednecks says.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s right Ray. If she was mine, I\u2019d be wantin\u2019 to keep her safe.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cPiece on the side? Is that what Mel told all of you?\u201d you ask which is followed by a lot of snickering.\n\n\u201cNot in so many words honey, but we ain\u2019t the idiots that he thinks we are. Why else would he tell us to lay off of ya if he wasn\u2019t stickin\u2019 ya? Sonofabitch already has Tina, don\u2019t see why he gets ta have TWO fine pieces of ass while some of us ain\u2019t got none.\u201d Ray remarks.\n\u201cCould I have one of those rifles please?\u201d you ask ignoring Ray\u2019s comments.\n\nRay snorts at your request.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so blondie. Maybe you think yer warrior princess or some shit cause you got lucky shootin\u2019 a couple of those freaks, but I ain\u2019t impressed and you ain\u2019t getting any of these rifles. Here, take one of these instead. Should be more than enough for you seein\u2019 as all yer gonna be doin\u2019 is hidin behind Mel the whole time anyway.\u201d Ray says and hands you a smaller pistol.\n\u201cFine, I don\u2019t need a big weapon anyway. I don\u2019t have to over compensate for something.\u201d You say taking the pistol.\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Ray asks.\n\u201cIt means she\u2019s sayin\u2019 you probably got a small pecker Ray, now quit givin\u2019 the girl a hard time and let\u2019s all get goin\u2019.\u201d Mel sudden remarks as he walks up with a couple more people.\n\nRay doesn\u2019t say anything and just glares at you before leaving for one of the trucks. Everyone else does likewise. Predictably, you have no wish to ride with any of them, let alone in the back of one of the pickups with a bunch of them so you ride up front with Mel especially since you want to address something.\n\nAs the trucks pull out from the trailer park, Mel fiddles with the radio, but he doesn\u2019t get anything except Ground Zero ads.\n\n\u201cGoddamn Ground Zero shit. I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you like I\u2019ve said to everyone else, it\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 conspiracy goin\u2019 on with them. In fact all of this shit goin\u2019 on is government related.\u201d Mel says turning off the radio.\n\u201cYeah, probably. Hey Mel, is it really necessary for you to lie and tell everyone that we\u2019re having sex?\u201d you ask.\n\nMel starts chuckling a little bit.\n\n\u201cWho said I did that?\u201d Mel asked.\n\u201cWell first of all a few days ago Tina flat out asked me if I had any intention of fucking you, and I had to clarify that I wasn\u2019t. She believed me, but she said you told her that I flirted with you. Then Ray just said that I was your piece on the side. Everyone else seems to believe that as well.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, first off I\u2019ll admit that I might\u2019ve said you were flirtin\u2019 with me to Tina, but there was a good reason. We\u2019re just makin\u2019 up from one of our many bad fights and I figured it might be good to get her a little jealous. Y\u2019know so she doesn\u2019t take me for granted and that she could possibly lose me if she isn\u2019t careful. Knowin\u2019 Tina she probably thought it was bullshit anyway, which is probably why she just flat out asked you as opposed to just clawing yer eyes out if she thought it was remotely true.\u201d\n\u201cWell she did say that she didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. She knew a girl like you wouldn\u2019t be interested in someone like me. Still, it was a good gesture on my part to show her I still care.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re not going to decipher hillbilly love life logic. You just continue to listen to Mel explain himself.\n\n\u201cNow as for Ray an\u2019 the rest. All I told them is to lay off of you a little bit since you were new to the trailer park an\u2019 you were doin\u2019 your best to contribute. I really can\u2019t help it if everyone jumps to conclusions.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not exactly dispelling those conclusions either.\u201d\n\nMel laughs again.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose yer right about that, but think of it this way, if they all think you\u2019re my squeeze on the side, they\u2019re actually all less likely to try anything because they won\u2019t want to answer to me. I mean right now all they do is stare a lot and make the occasional cat call. Now I could tell them that we\u2019re really not doing anything, but after interactin\u2019 with Ray, do you really want him or some of the others sniffin\u2019 around on a regular basis?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I suppose not\u2026just wish there was another way.\u201d\n\u201cMan\u2019s world, blondie, deal with it.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I am. I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nYou and Mel continue to drive in relative silence until you get to the carnival destination.\n\n\u201cThis should be coming up to it soon.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t even know there was a carnival nearby.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, set up shop I think last Saturday. Most of us from the trailer park went there earlier in the week. I didn\u2019t go mainly because I was too busy fightin\u2019 with Tina at the time and I didn\u2019t wanna run into any clowns. Hate those creepy fuckers.\u201d Me;\n\u201cReally? I always liked clowns. I even briefly thought about wanting to be one when I was little. Oh well, guess that will always be the dream.\u201d You say causing Mel to give you a look like you just creeped him out a little.\n\nYou drive up to the carnival, which looks like it was in the middle of being packed down, but other events got in the way and given the ones you suffered, you can sort of imagine what those were. The place looks like a warzone and there are several bodies lying on the ground\n\n\u201cLooks like I was right, the Guard was here.\u201d Mel says pointing to a military truck near a dilapidated tent.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think they\u2019re still in charge here either.\u201d You say.\nIn the distance you see a few small figures near a large tent and then they run into it when they see you pull up.\n\u201cWell looks like whoever is still in charge here is going to be meetin\u2019 us real soon.\u201d Mel says and stops the truck. The other trucks following stop as well.\n\nYou see several people now step out of the big tent. Some of them are armed, but then again so is your side.\n\n\u201cGet ready, but stay in the truck. I\u2019m gonna actually try to handle this without a gunfight, but I\u2019m not hopeful about that.\u201d Mel remarks and gets out of the truck.\n\nYou see him motioning and shouting to the rest to hold fire and then he addresses the carnie crowd who seem to mostly consist of midgets and the main one addressing Mel is dressed in clown clothing, though he doesn\u2019t seem to be wearing the makeup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Ain\u2019t nobody lookin\u2019 for a fight.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way, given that you\u2019ve come with three trucks full of armed men.\u201d The midget clown says.\n\u201cHeh, well I\u2019m sure given your own heightened state of awareness, you know things are getting\u2019 dangerous nowadays. Anyway my name\u2019s Mel, I\u2019m guessin\u2019 since you\u2019re the one talkin\u2019 you\u2019re in charge here. Ringmaster or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cLook, we don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t get any trouble. You\u2026uh\u2026got some military gear here too I see. That truck over there.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what of it?\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing, but that brings about the question of where are the guardsmen\u2026heh yeah they tried to tell us what to do too. Didn\u2019t work out so well. The second amendment says you got the right to pack it after all. Government can\u2019t just do what they want.\u201d\n\nAt this point more people come out of the tent, which in turn makes more people get out of their trucks. You get out too, though you\u2019re taking cover behind the door. Your people and the carnies are both starting to eye each other waiting for someone to fire a shot.\n\n\u201cLook let me cut to the chase shorty. I\u2019m assumin\u2019 you might know by now what\u2019s been happenin\u2019 back in town. Besides the government tryin\u2019 to pull their shit, there\u2019s a bunch of freaks runnin\u2019 around tryin\u2019 to eat people. A bunch of them attacked us last night and while we fought them off, some of us got badly hurt and are in need of medical supplies. Now of course we did try goin\u2019 into town first, but was just too fucked up there an\u2019 we didn\u2019t make much head way what with the freaks AND the guard all over the damn place. Then it occurred to me today that your circus might still be around and the National Guard probably would\u2019ve been here as well so we decided to investigate. Now the group of weekend warriors at the trailer park had shit for medical supplies. So I\u2019m hoping your detachment had more in that department.\u201d\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got anything! Just go away or we\u2019ll open fire!\u201d the midget clown says.\n\nMel isn\u2019t convinced and in any case he has no intention of backing down now.\n\n\u201cNow you might get a few of us, but I\u2019m bettin, most of us are better shots than y\u2019all, so if you give us what medicine supplies you do have we\u2019ll leave here in peace, if not well\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile Mel is probably doing the best he can in trying to resolve this without a gun battle, but you know how this is going to go down. It\u2019s just been that sort of week.\n\nSuddenly someone fires a shot and then another from one side and then it\u2019s a full-blown shoot out. (You mainly hide behind the truck, firing every once in a while)\n\nThe carnies aren\u2019t holding back, but your side does indeed have much better aim and midgets are falling like flies until they all fall back into the big tent again.\n\nAfter some more shooting which is completely one sided now, Mel calls a halt to it.\n\n\u201cWe can fire all day into that big tent, but we can\u2019t be sure if we\u2019re actually hitting anyone since we ain\u2019t got x-ray vision an\u2019 I don\u2019t want us wastin\u2019 anymore ammo. We gotta do something else.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just throw grenades at it? We got some from the Guard that was fuckin\u2019 with us.\u201d Ray asks.\n\u201cBecause they might have medical supplies in there ya idiot. We start blowin shit up, an it defeats the whole purpose of the trip. I think we need to spread out an creep up then just rush in.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cSo your solution is to go in there like a SWAT team an\u2019 possibly get our asses shot off? Fuck that. I\u2019m blowin\u2019 that motherfucker up.\u201d\n\nAt this point Ray and a couple others look and nod at each other and start heading towards the big tent with grenades in their hand. Mel tells them to stop, but his orders are ignored and met with a couple of swear laden sentences of being tired of him always telling them what to do.\n\nMel is visibly angry; though you\u2019re surprised he isn\u2019t doing more to stop them from disobeying his orders. As much as Mel isn\u2019t exactly your favorite person, you\u2019d hate to see this as the first sign of a \u201cchange in leadership.\u201d Especially if it\u2019s going to be Ray.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let them blow up the tent", "result": "Opening fire on anyone other than carnies probably isn\u2019t a good idea, at least not on your own. Maybe if Mel gave the order it might be different, but again he surprises you and doesn\u2019t do such a thing.\n\n\u201cRay, you\u2019re a goddamn idiot.\u201d Mel shouts and just watches as Ray and the two others quicken their pace towards the tent.\n\nAll three of them get half way to the tent and then prepare to throw, which they do. Two of the grenades hit the tent, but one manages to roll inside it. Unfortunately for them one of the carnies steps in the tent entrance and throws it back!\n\n\u201cHoly fuck! Run!\u201d is all Ray manages to shout which is then followed by a bit of gunfire from the carnie who threw the grenade. He\u2019s hit the leg, but that\u2019s not the worst of it since he\u2019s not that far from the grenade when he falls to the ground.\n\nMel, you and everyone else take cover behind the trucks in preparation for the explosions soon to follow, all three of them.\n\nWhen the smoke clears and everyone slowly looks out from behind their cover.\n\nIt\u2019s a devastating mess. The big tent is partially gone, though surprisingly still standing. One can see inside most of it now though and there are a lot of bodies\u2026\n\nSpeaking of bodies, Ray\u2019s is in pieces since he failed to get away from the blast in time. A crater now exists where the grenade fell and Ray\u2019s body parts aren\u2019t too far from it. The ones who followed Ray faired better and managed to get away from the blast.\n\n\u201cI fuckin\u2019 knew something like that was gonna happen. Come on spread out and head towards what\u2019s left of that tent. Careful though, they might still have some fight left!\u201d Mel shouts with nobody really mourning the loss of Ray.\n\nYou all cautiously proceed forward with weapons raised and taking cover as much as possible. While it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry, there isn\u2019t much fight left in any of the survivors who are now a mixture of wounded, dying or just plain scared.\n\n\u201cPlease! We surrender! Take whatever you want, just don\u2019t kill us!\u201d one of the midgets shouts from amongst the carnage.\n\u201cGoddamn right we will be! None of this woulda been necessary had you just given us whatever medical supplies or medicine you had! Now besides this fuckin\u2019 big top, is there anyone else lurking around that we should know about?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026um\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a fuckin\u2019 answer!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno! I mean yeah, maybe! There might be a few people hidin\u2019 in the trailers, just don\u2019t kill anyone else, please!\u201d\n\u201cSome of you search the rest of this place, but keep an eye out for more carnies! If anyone gives ya too much trouble, you know what to do.\u201d Mel shouts.\n\nThe remainder of your time is mostly spent looking through what remains of the tent which actually did hold some medical supplies though not many and some of them were obviously destroyed by the grenades.\n\nAs their belongings and supplies are looted and they are \u201cherded\u201d into group, the carnies, the carnies make no attempts at resistance and if there were any hiding in the trailers, they must\u2019ve ran for the wilderness or were really good at hiding, because nobody finds anyone else.\n\nSeveral make an attempt to beg you to leave something, but these are met with verbal commands to shut up before they suffer further. Another pleads to Mel to think about their own wounded, but this is met with smash to the gut with Mel\u2019s rifle. It\u2019s the only physical abuse that occurs before they realize they\u2019re receiving the only mercy they\u2019re currently experiencing.\n\nYour own personal feelings on the current situation is that it\u2019s certainly not \u201cright\u201d but what can you do?\n\nAfter looting the carnival of what useful stuff they have, you leave the demoralized carnies and head back to the trailer park.\n\n\u201cWell that went better than expected, just lost Ray, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really broken up by that.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cCrushed. Surprised you didn\u2019t shoot him for directly challenging your authority though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI was more concerned with the carnies than Ray at that point. Any other time I might\u2019ve given him a beat down, but I wouldn\u2019t have fucking killed him. Sheesh blondie, haven\u2019t you learned by now that just because I\u2019m an asshole to everyone, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m some fuckin\u2019 heartless killer? I mean the whole point of this fuckin\u2019 endeavor was to get medicine for folks who are bitten. If I was that cold, I woulda just shot \u2018em like some people wanted me to do. Shit, I didn\u2019t even enjoy any of what I had to do to those carnies. I mean I know they had their people to look after, but so did we an\u2019 I ain\u2019t sorry for it.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well I suppose you\u2019re right. Guess we\u2019re all a little more complex than appearances would seem.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you see us all a little more than stupid trailer park trash now blondie?\u201d Mel asks.\n\u201cActually I\u2019ve more or less discarded that view since I\u2019ve been staying here besides I\u2019m hardly in a position to talk seeing as I\u2019m living with you all.\u201d\n\u201cSo K\u2019 blondie, we needed someone to fill out the snobby tease role in the community anyway.\u201d\n\nYou chuckle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not though. I\u2019m just selective about my standards.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t need to justify anything to me. I got a woman.\u201d Mel replies.\n\u201cThe thing is despite it all, so far you lot have been at least been cordial with me as my own family was. Dunno if that\u2019s funny or sad.\u201d\n\u201cWell depends. Stick around long enough blondie an\u2019 you might just become part of our family.\u201d\n\nYou start to outright laugh.\n\n\u201cSee, you should fuckin\u2019 laugh more around the others. It makes you seem less snooty.\u201d Mel replies.\n\n\u201cI guess anything\u2019s possible. Doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d You remark.\n\nYou and Mel continue to converse on the way back to the trailer park. It\u2019s mostly about nothing of major importance, but eventually he goes on about how the next step on the agenda is to contact his cousin Clem who apparently owns a farm further past where the carnival was located.\n\n\u201cFigure we\u2019re gonna have to do something about our food soon and instead of riskin\u2019 killin\u2019 ourselves going into the town for whatever scraps are left, it might be best to enlist my cousin\u2019s help in that matter.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cSo you really think order won\u2019t be restored by the government?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cPftt, fuck no blondie. Considerin\u2019 how the National Guard came in last time, I\u2019d just as soon not want government assholes around anyway. But my guess is things are gonna be fucked up like this for a long time so self-sufficiency is gonna have to be a priority.\n\nPretty much the assessment you and most others have had. Still, it\u2019s a good sign that Mel\u2019s at least thinking ahead with the food situation.\n\nEventually you get back to the trailer park where things appear to be running smoothly. The bitten folks are finally seen to properly. The good news is the bites don\u2019t seem to be infectious at least not in the \u201czombie bite\u201d sense. The bad news is not all of them make it and Billy Ray dies of his wounds, depriving the trailer park of yet another member with \u201cRay\u201d in their name.\n\nAs for other things of importance, mostly everyone who is able is pitching in to help in some way. Still realizing you\u2019ve got to work with these people now, you volunteer to keep look out near the entrance for the remainder of the day and part of the night (Which is thankfully uneventful) until eventually some guy named Bob tells you that they\u2019re taking over the graveyard shift.\n\nHaving been relieved of your duties, you return to your trailer, which is starting to feel more comfortable to you. It\u2019s no basement, but it\u2019s home.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou groggily awaken to the sounds of a bunch of giggling outside, a few bangs on your door and what sounds to be a thumping sound on the side of your trailer.\n\nYou look out the window and see a bunch of children playing outside. While you knew there were kids here it was weird that you never really saw them grouped together until today.\n\nMaking sure you\u2019re decent, you step outside where upon one of the smaller kids suddenly stops bouncing his ball against your trailer.\n\n\u201cSee, I told ya that Tina said that pretty blond lady lived here.\u201d One of the boys says.\n\u201cWhy the hell are all you kids doing around my trailer?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTina said we should come over here where we were out of the way since most of the adults are either workin\u2019 on the new barricades or that tank lookin\u2019 thing in the field over there.\u201d One of the kids says and points in that direction.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what that all has to do with me.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cTina said you\u2019d look after us.\u201d\n\nAt this point you drop your head in defeat. It\u2019s too early in the day for this.\n\n\u201cYou okay lady?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine kid. Just re-evaluating what my position is in the community here.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah anyway, I told Tina that we didn\u2019t need some baby sitter, but then Mel shouted at all of us so we ran over here, before he got madder.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, I wasn\u2019t scared. I just didn\u2019t feel like helping that ol\u2019 asshole anyway.\u201d A slightly older kid says attempting to puff up his chest.\n\nSo you\u2019ve been assigned to baby-sitting. You aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s bad or good. On one hand you\u2019re tempted to take it as a good sign since the folks here are obviously trusting enough for you to look after their offspring.\n\nThen again they may just not give a shit and these kids could be little hellraisers that their parents want nothing to do with.\n\n\u201cHey lady, did you kill any zombies a couple days ago?\u201d one child asks you.\n\u201cTommy, they weren\u2019t zombies ya moron! They were just crazy people!\u201d a girl shouts.\n\u201cHow do you know Jenny?\u201d Tommy asks.\n\u201cCause my mama shot one in the chest and it died! Zombies only die if you hit \u2018em in the head!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, an\u2019 the people who got bit didn\u2019t turn into zombies either, not even Billy Ray an\u2019 he died!\u201d another kid exclaims.\n\nAt this point the children begin arguing about zombies until you interrupt.\n\n\u201cOkay quiet down kids, but to answer your question Tommy, yes I did kill a few of those\u2026well whatever they were.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWere you scared?! I was scared when they attacked! I hid under my mama\u2019s bed!\u201d the kid with the ball admits.\n\nAt this point the oldest boy, who was claiming he wasn\u2019t afraid of Mel, boldly comes up to you. He looks like he might be thirteen at most\n\n\u201cHah, I wasn\u2019t scared. I even shot one of those things right in the face! Pow! See, I\u2019m not a scared little kid like the rest of them here.\u201d The boy says puffing up again and making gun gestures.\n\u201cHmm, I see. Back up boy.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re invading my personal space.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI wanna invade more than that.\u201d The boy says laughing at his own innuendo. One of the boys laugh along with him; the Jenny girl rolls her eyes. All the rest of the kids look confused on the matter. Considering you\u2019re used to hearing similar from the older knuckle draggers around here, you\u2019re hardly surprised to hear it from this snot nosed brat.\n\n\u201cWell, better save that idea for your wet dreams boy, cause that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d You remark frankly, which causes Jenny to laugh a bit.\n\u201cWhat are you some sort of dyke like Butchie Billie? Come on I like older women\u2026\u201d the teen says and at this point tries to grab your chest, but you easily grab his wrist.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing you little shit?! Have you lost your fucking mind?\u201d you say and start digging your nails into his flesh.\n\u201cOWWW! Lemme go you crazy bitch!\u201d the boy cries and then you twist his arm behind his back.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right I AM a fucking crazy ass bitch! My uncle was a goddamn serial killer, my ex-boyfriend was a cultist, and I killed several of those fucking cannibal freaks without blinking. Now get the fuck outta here before I do worse to your little ass!\u201d you say in his ear and kick him off the steps of your trailer.\n\nThe boy goes face first into the dirt and while he quickly picks himself up, he just glares at you and runs away. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s going off to cry somewhere.\n\n\u201cHahahahaha! That was so cool what you did to Alan! Can you teach me to do that?\u201d Jenny asks.\n\u201cWas your uncle really a serial killer?\u201d Tommy asks.\n\nBefore you can answer a bright flash followed by a loud noise in the distance grabs everyone\u2019s attention. A couple of the kids scream about their eyes, fortunately you weren\u2019t looking in the direction at the time, but it was still really bright.\n\nYou then look to the west and in the far distance you see it. A mushroom cloud.\n\nYou\u2019re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn\u2019t engulfed you, so you\u2019re guessing that it wasn\u2019t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn\u2019t much that can done about it.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\nOddly you don\u2019t even feel any fear. You\u2019re a little anxious you suppose, but the events of this past week have probably helped in putting you in a \u201cdoomsday\u201d mindset already.\n\nAt this point several of the children huddle together a bit, a few run off to presumably find their parents. A couple of them are visibly crying.\n\n\u201cAre we going to die soon?\u201d Jenny asks.\n\u201cEventually perhaps, but not today.\u201d You answer.\n\nAt this point you see several women running towards your direction presumably the mothers of these children (oddly you see no fathers, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because they\u2019re busy or none of these children have one).\n\nAfter the various mothers either scream at you for not looking after their child \u201cproperly\u201d (Never mind the fact that they should have been doing it) or are actually pleasant and thank you while they calm down their child, you see Tina briskly approaching, she waves at you.\n\n\u201cHey blondie, we\u2019ve got an important meeting. Your presence is required.\u201d Tina remarks.\n\u201cGlad to see I\u2019m being included in these major decisions unlike this morning.\u201d You say walking towards Tina.\n\u201cHey, you got to sleep in late and barely had to look after all these brats due to nukes, I\u2019d say you got off easy as far as work is concerned.\u201d\n\nAs you walk with Tina, you can already hear the shouting from the crowd gathering around Mel\u2019s trailer.\n\n\u201cSo how bad off are we?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell if Mel\u2019s cousin ends up helping on the food and water front, like Mel thinks he will, I suppose we\u2019ll be fine. Just need to travel up to his farm. Mel\u2019s thinking we\u2019ll probably still have to make another attempt into town though for shit. Might as well give you a heads up blondie, but I think you\u2019ll be going on one or the other of these trips today.\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cFigured as much. Honestly, I think I\u2019d rather do that than be a baby sitter.\u201d\n\nWith Tina chuckling at your remark, you briefly think about your past life and realize it was just as well you enjoyed your \u201cgood girl\u201d basement dwelling years as much as you did. If you\u2019d actually done anything with your life, it would\u2019ve likely been for naught anyway considering current events.\n\nYou sort of wonder what happened to your siblings and even your ex-boyfriend. Are they all dead now? Are they alive? Do you even care at all? Not really, though you\u2019re pretty sure that you\u2019re going to beat the shit out of Donna if you ever see her again.\n\nYou also wonder if you\u2019ll ever leave this place eventually since you can\u2019t really ever seeing yourself being \u201cone of the crowd\u201d here. Still, you\u2019ll have see how things play out.\n\nIn any event, this is all stuff for a possible future and you\u2019ll worry about it then, right now you have to worry about surviving the day.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Trader of TRASH\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\n\u201cSo that Bobby guy was really your ex-boyfriend? He was fucking creepy.\u201d Jenny remarks as you drive away from the compound.\n\u201cYeah, well being head of a cult will do that I suppose. He wasn\u2019t quite as creepy when I met him though. In any case it\u2019s good that his sister Diana\u2019s not in the picture anymore. I guarantee if she was still alive, this little peace between us and the Cult of Tiamat wouldn\u2019t even be possible. Mel should be pleased about that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, we even got some good stuff from them. I\u2019m surprised he gave us as much clean water as he did\u2026.you think he still likes you?\u201d\n\nYou laugh.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fairly sure Tiamat is the only love of his life, with his sister Helen trailing behind, though maybe he did remember the good times we had together and decided to be generous with the supplies\u2026or maybe this is all a trick and he actually poisoned the water with something hoping it\u2019ll kill everyone.\u201d\n\u201cOh shit! I didn\u2019t even think about that! You think so?!\u201d Jenny remarks.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m just joking. I mean I suppose it IS possible, but that\u2019s not the cult\u2019s style. Besides, if Bobby DID do that, he most likely would\u2019ve secretly warned me so I don\u2019t drink it at least.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think it\u2019s safe?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Doesn\u2019t matter anyway since I\u2019m going to go trade it to New Security for their fizzy soda. Can\u2019t get that anywhere else and it\u2019s not like we need anymore water, we currently have a good supply.\u201d\n\u201cSee that\u2019s why I like coming on these runs with you. It\u2019s more interesting than just staying home listening to people argue all the time.\u201d Jenny remarks.\n\u201cHm, trust me if I could, I\u2019d rather stay home all the time, but unfortunately that\u2019s not the way the world currently works that allows me to relive the days of my more carefree youth.\u201d You say.\n\nAt this point Jenny asks you again about your \u201cformer life\u201d but like you always tell her, there isn\u2019t much to it. You didn\u2019t do much, but you get the impression she\u2019s just fascinated by the fact that you went from your humble beginning to what you currently do now along with all your survival skills you\u2019ve acquired. Maybe it\u2019s a bit inspiring for her, you don\u2019t know. Though sometimes when you think about it, it is a little impressive.\n\n\u201cHey you ever think about revisiting your old house just out of curiosity?\u201d Jenny asks.\n\u201cActually when all the crazy shit in town died down and there weren\u2019t crazy cannibals running around everywhere, I did. I sort of made a detour there during one of my solo runs.\u201d\n\u201cReally? I never heard about that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you? I never told anyone about it before. Anyway, I sort of went there partially out of curiosity, but also because my brother Ben built an underground shelter in the backyard of the place. Probably nothing the scale of one of those Ground Zero shelters like they used to annoyingly run ads for in the old days though.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but didn\u2019t you tell me your brother killed himself?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but knowing him, he probably still had that thing well stocked, so I figured it was worth a shot to look for. Unfortunately I looked and looked and looked in that backyard for hours and I couldn\u2019t find the fucking entrance. I don\u2019t know how the hell he moved it around and hid it like he did, but he did and like I said, I couldn\u2019t find it. Who knows? Maybe it\u2019s completely collapsed now anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSo nobody was squatting in your house?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I could tell. There were a couple times where I felt like someone else was there, but nobody ever showed up. While there were some signs of natural decay and some things had obviously been looted everything else was mostly intact. My own room was completely vandalized though. I mean it looked like someone even tried to set the place on fire and there was some graffiti with the usual vulgarity on the walls. Sort of weird really and I didn\u2019t stick around too long there. Guess it\u2019s like they say, you can\u2019t go home again.\u201d\n\u201cWell you have a new home anyway.\u201d Jenny remarks.\n\u201cEh, I have a place to put my stuff and sleep, but I dunno if I\u2019ll ever feel at home at the trailer park. I mean I get along better with everyone there now than I did, but I still just don\u2019t fit in. The further I travel on these trading runs, I sometimes wonder if I shouldn\u2019t just strike out on my own. I certainly have horded enough shit to be a travelling trader if I wanted to.\u201d\n\nJenny at this point gives you a concerned look.\n\n\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t just suddenly leave like that would you?\u201d\n\nYou look back at Jenny and you think about telling her that you don\u2019t really have much attachment to where you live. It\u2019s not even your long lost basement that you once loved so much. You also think about telling her you have even less attachment to most of the people who live there. Sure some of them are okay, and some you even get along better with than you did with your own family, but it\u2019s not enough to keep you around.\n\nBut then you think, maybe that isn\u2019t entirely true.\n\nJenny is about the same age you were when Donna just suddenly abandoned you. You remember when that happened you were a bit numb. Some of it wasn\u2019t surprising, but nevertheless you did feel a great sense of betrayal due to believing you were building a new and stronger relationship with her at that time. You got over it pretty quickly mainly because there were so many other fires to put out at the time, but you didn\u2019t ever forget.\n\nWhatever happened to Donna you suppose you\u2019ll never know. Maybe she died, maybe she\u2019s living well. Who knows?\n\nWhat you do know is over the years Jenny has sort of followed you around mainly due to her own mother basically not giving a shit about her and then later dying in an explosion due to Dan\u2019s failed attempt to create a new \u201cmeth lab.\u201d\n\nYou suppose she probably believes the pair of you have a bond too. Probably a bit more of misguided \u201chero worship\u201d on her part and her ties to you are probably stronger than yours to her, but you aren\u2019t going to do what Donna did to you.\n\n\u201cNah, I just think about it sometimes that\u2019s all. I\u2019m a bit too old to go traipsing across the nuclear wasteland, sleeping in a truck and worrying about fuel and the like on an everyday basis. However, if I ever do decide to leave, I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo I could come with you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I suppose it would help to have someone watching my back if I was going to do it.\u201d\n\u201cI think that would be great adventure! And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re too old. If my mom was still alive you\u2019d only be like a couple years younger than her. In fact sometimes I think of you as my\u2026\u201d\n\nYou tense up. You don\u2019t want to hear that\u2026\n\n\u201cStop. Just stop right there Jenny. Don\u2019t even finish that sentence. I am NOT your mom.\u201d You say with a stern look.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that. I was going to say I sometimes think of you as my big sister that I never had.\u201d Jenny remarks.\n\nYou cease being tense.\n\n\u201cOh. Well\u2026okay. Yeah. I suppose that\u2019s okay. I guess in some ways you\u2019re like the younger sister I never had.\u201d You respond with a smile.\n\u201cBut you did have a younger sister.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and she was a slutty and ultimately selfish cunt. Like I said, you\u2019re the younger sister I NEVER had.\u201d\n\nWith a couple of minor chuckles from you and Jenny about this comment, the pair of you begin speaking about various things as you drive to your next destination.\n\nYou never imagined you\u2019d wind up as a trader/scavenger for a trailer park community, but in the scheme of things it\u2019s not that bad of a life in this new harsh world.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Shoot at Ray", "result": "You\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019re going to let this spiral into a power struggle with the possibility that Ray could be in charge.

Assuming the carnies didn\u2019t already pull up stakes and assuming the military even bothered to send a detachment to a carnival, I can\u2019t believe that the detachment would\u2019ve been any better supplied than the one sent here.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying exactly, blondie?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that it would be a better plan to go back into town. I know my area alone has a couple of pharmacies and even a grocery store. I could easily direct you to them.\u201d\n\u201cTown? That was a clusterfuck the last time we tried that! Besides, how do we know those places haven\u2019t already been looted?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk, but I believe if you want a better chance at getting medicine and medical supplies, it would be better bet to go back into town. You\u2019re better equipped and prepared for what to expect in town now too. It\u2019s up to you though, you\u2019re in charge after all.\u201d You say.\n\nMel looks at you and then looks at Tina.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I voted to shoot them.\u201d Tina remarks.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re never fuckin\u2019 supportive. (Sigh) Fuck it. You make a good point blondie. We\u2019ll head back into town, nobody\u2019s gonna like it, but like I said, fuck it. You go head over to the entrance, I\u2019ll be over there soon.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re about to go over to the trucks by the entrance, Tina grabs a hold of your arm with a semi-forceful grip. You spin around and see that her face isn\u2019t one of friendliness.\n\n\u201cSo, you managed to change Mel\u2019s mind. Pretty impressive. I have a hard time doing that at the best of times. Maybe he is fuckin\u2019 ya.\u201d Tina says.\n\u201cWhat?! Tina I swear I\u2019m not doing anything with Mel!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think you are, but you\u2019re not exactly adverse to usin\u2019 yer natural attractiveness to get yer way. Yer doin\u2019 it to keep the rest of the slugs off of ya. I get it, but if Mel does some fool thing because it was his idea, I can handle that. He does it on a regular basis. Hell, if he does some fool thing cause one of his drinkin\u2019 buddies thought it was a good idea, I can handle that as well since it doesn\u2019t even happen that often and he usually realizes it before it gets too out of hand. However, Mel goin\u2019 to do some fool thing because some tease fluttered her eyes at him is something else entirely.\n\u201cTina, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up blondie, fore I pull that pretty golden hair from your head by the roots. Now listen to me close, this is the LAST time you EVER influence Mel to do something ever again. Got it?\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019ve certainly \u201ctoughened up\u201d this week and Tina\u2019s actually shorter than you, but even now you doubt that you\u2019d be able to physically take a trailer park girl like her that\u2019s probably gotten into more fist fights than the number of years you\u2019ve been alive.\n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d You meekly say.\n\nTina doesn\u2019t even acknowledge your compliance; she just shoulder shoves you out of the way when she heads back to her trailer.\n\nWith that unpleasantness out of the way, you head over to the trucks. When you arrive at your destination, a group of rednecks are already there checking various rifles and handguns. It really does look like they got enough to take on an army.\n\n\u201cWell now if it isn\u2019t blondie. I\u2019m surprised Mel is riskin\u2019 his piece on the side like this.\u201d One of the sleazier rednecks says.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s right Ray. If she was mine, I\u2019d be wantin\u2019 to keep her safe.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cPiece on the side? Is that what Mel told all of you?\u201d you ask which is followed by a lot of snickering.\n\n\u201cNot in so many words honey, but we ain\u2019t the idiots that he thinks we are. Why else would he tell us to lay off of ya if he wasn\u2019t stickin\u2019 ya? Sonofabitch already has Tina, don\u2019t see why he gets ta have TWO fine pieces of ass while some of us ain\u2019t got none.\u201d Ray remarks.\n\u201cNothing is going on between Mel and I.\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh? Is that right blondie? Well how about you get something going on right HERE!\u201d Ray remarks while grabbing his crotch causing everyone to laugh.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not a lesbian and I don\u2019t eat pussy.\u201d You remark dryly.\n\nYour insult doesn\u2019t quite sink in immediately, though Ray gets the idea he has been insulted.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that mean?\u201d Ray demands.\n\u201cIt means she doesn\u2019t think you got a dick and that you ain\u2019t a man. Something we all knew a long time ago Ray, not stop givin\u2019 the girl grief and hand her a pistol.\u201d Mel suddenly says as he walks up with a few more people behind him.\n\nAfter Ray grudgingly hands you a pistol and then Mel breaks the bad news to everyone that they\u2019re heading back into town. There is predictably a lot of protesting and grumbling, but after shouting everyone down everyone complies with Mel\u2019s orders. Everyone gets in their vehicles and you ride up front in Mel\u2019s pick up truck.\n\nAs the trucks pull out from the trailer park, Mel fiddles with the radio, but he doesn\u2019t get anything except Ground Zero ads.\n\n\u201cGoddamn Ground Zero shit. I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you like I\u2019ve said to everyone else, it\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 conspiracy goin\u2019 on with them. In fact all of this shit goin\u2019 on is government related.\u201d Mel says turning off the radio.\n\nThe rest of your drive to town is mostly a quiet one. Mel doesn\u2019t bother speaking to you and you\u2019re a little too pre-occupied by what you\u2019re going to do about your current situation because between the incident with Tina and the one with Ray you can\u2019t help but think that you\u2019re never going to fit in or be comfortable there. Your sister might\u2019ve just ditched you, but you\u2019re starting to think she had the right idea about leaving.\n\nWhen you do finally get to town it\u2019s predictably a warzone. A war in which it appears the military did NOT win. You see overturned vehicles, dead bodies and destruction, but there is no semblance of organized order anywhere.\n\nThe only thing that is \u201corganized\u201d are the cannibal freaks and there are large groups of them roving the streets or already feasting on the dead. They naturally start attacking whenever your group drives through an infested area. Shooting and running them over becomes the order of the day as you direct Mel to the best way to get to your own neighborhood area.\n\nWhen you finally do get to your area, the number of freaks severely decreases. It\u2019s sort of odd, but where you lived seems relatively safe. There are still signs of devastation here and there are certainly dead bodies to be seen, but so far it\u2019s a lot safer than the rest of the town.\n\n\u201cGuess the military cleaned up this area, before they got their asses kicked. How much further is our destination?\u201d Mel asks.\n\u201cJust make a left up here and you\u2019ll be there.\u201d You remark.\n\nFollowing your directions Mel makes a turn and then pulls into the parking lot of what looks to be a completely deserted pharmacy with a few broken windows. The other two trucks park nearby. The pharmacy across the street looks deserted as well. No telling what\u2019s inside either of them, but you sort of get the impression the noise of the vehicles would\u2019ve attracted freak attention if any were lurking about.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the grocery store?\u201d Mel asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a few blocks up the street.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOkay guess it\u2019s time to tell everyone the next phase of this plan.\u201d\n\nMel gets out of the truck and calls attention to everyone.\n\n\u201cAlright, we got three locations to search, which is good because there are three big groups of us. I\u2019m gonna search this pharmacy. Ray, you go search the one across the street. Dan, your group can get back in your truck and search the grocery store up the block.\u201d Mel says.\n\u201cWhat? Aw Mel, why I gotta drive all that way?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit Dan it ain\u2019t that fuckin\u2019 far! Just fuckin\u2019 do it! Besides, I know you. If you\u2019re searching one of these pharmacies, your junkies ass is gonna pocket all the med for yourself and claim you didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\n\nWhile Dan is in the middle of protesting, you\u2019re coming to the conclusion of your earlier thoughts on the ride over here. Namely, you\u2019re tired of this group and you\u2019re going to risk going it alone. You figure you\u2019re already close to your house, you could probably sneak away and head there for temporary relief to plan your next move. Though if you went with Dan you\u2019d be even closer to your home.\n\nWhen Mel finishes ordering everyone about, you go up to talk to him.\n\n\u201cHey Mel, I think I should go with Dan.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What the fuck you wanna go with that junkie asshole for?\u201d\n\u201cWell grocery stores do tend to carry a small supply of medicine too, I figure I can keep an eye on him if he decides to not be in a sharing mood.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, good point blondie\u2026hey Dan! Don\u2019t go yet, blondie\u2019s comin\u2019 with ya so make room in the front!\u201d Mel shouts before Dan pulls away.\n\nYou hop into Dan\u2019s truck and you\u2019re soon on your way though Dan\u2019s attention is half on the road and half on you.\n\n\u201cSort of surprised you wanted to come with me blondie.\u201d He says scratching himself.\n\u201cWell, Mel doesn\u2019t entirely trust you. He thinks if you find any medicine in the grocery store, you\u2019ll just keep it for yourself. So he\u2019s sent me to keep an eye on you.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dan says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dan, I\u2019m not gonna rat you out if you take some things for personal use. I know it\u2019s not really your fault and that you\u2019re just sick.\u201d You say in an empathetic tone.\n\nDan smiles at you revealing his horrible dental conditions.\n\n\u201cSee that\u2019s what I\u2019ve told people before! I\u2019m glad you understand darlin\u2019. I mean I\u2019ve really tried to quit before, but\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Dan goes on with his pathetic sob story about how he\u2019s tried to kick his drug habit, but you\u2019re not really listening. Your thoughts of escaping these ignorant redneck assholes are filling your mind.\n\nWhen you get to your destination, the grocery store is in much the same condition as the pharmacies were. Dan, you and the rest get out of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cSeems like this place could be clear, but keep alert anyway. Could be somethin\u2019 as big as a Butchie Billie, or it could be as small as Wade\u2019s dick!\u201d Dan laughs causing Wade to swear at Dan and others to chuckle.\n\nStill set on your plan of escape, you think about how you\u2019re going to do it. The easiest way would be to just sneak away at the earliest opportunity and run home. You\u2019re fairly confident you could do it.\n\nOf course you\u2019re also wondering if you shouldn\u2019t just get away from these assholes, but the whole forsaken town in general. Staying here even in the \u201csafety\u201d of your home still isn\u2019t going to eliminate the problem that you\u2019re going to be located in cannibal central.\n\nOf course if you want to leave town the safest way to do that is by vehicle which means you\u2019re going to have to engage in the riskier endeavor of stealing Dan\u2019s keys.", "action_results": [{"action": "Sneak away", "result": "You\u2019re likely going to get shot or worse if you try to steal the keys or the truck. There are too many rednecks around and they\u2019re probably better with their weapons than you are. It\u2019ll be much easier to just sneak away. At best they might call out and search for you, but eventually Mel or their own common sense will tell them that you aren\u2019t worth risking their lives sticking around for.\n\nYour group goes into the grocery store, which must still have on some sort of emergency lighting where upon everyone begins to carefully search the place. While there has been some looting and even signs of fighting that went on here, the place is in better shape than anyone thought.\nYou grab one of the hand baskets and gradually start distancing yourself from the rest. You start loading up on some nearby cans, which you aren\u2019t really paying much attention to since you\u2019re more focused on what the other members of your group are doing.\n\nWhen you see that you\u2019re far enough away from them and they seem preoccupied with other things, you take the opportunity to head back outside. Still making the effort to not look suspicious just in case, you put the handbasket into the bed of the pick up truck and then when you\u2019re sure nobody is watching that\u2019s when you run.\n\nYou run from the grocery store and don\u2019t even look back. You half expect to hear some shouting telling you to stop, but you don\u2019t hear any.\n\nWhen you get far enough away you keep a quick pace, but slow down a bit since you\u2019re losing you\u2019re breath. You\u2019re really going to have to get used to exercising on a regular basis to boost the endurance you think.\n\nThe one thing that sticks out as you\u2019re walking through your neighborhood is how eerily quiet it is. You still see signs of destruction and even dead bodies, but you\u2019re not seeing a living soul. On one hand it\u2019s great that you aren\u2019t being assaulted by cannibal freaks, but on the other hand it makes you wonder what the hell happened in your neighborhood to result in it being such a ghost area. At this point you\u2019re worried that maybe somebody hidden is watching you.\n\nDespite all your concerns, nothing attacks or otherwise hinders you by the time you get home. You\u2019re anxious to get in as well. You know it\u2019s only going to be a temporary respite, but at least you\u2019ll get a bit of peace while you ponder what to do next. Maybe you can look for that hidden shelter your brother built in the backyard.\n\nAs your tired feet hit heavily on each front step, you briefly wonder if either of your siblings are home. Peter\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the driveway, but then you did leave it at Julie\u2019s. If he\u2019s still here, you suppose you\u2019ll have to explain what happened on that front. Kelly\u2019s vehicle isn\u2019t here either, so maybe your home has been abandoned.\n\nThe front door of course is predictably locked, but fortunately you still have your key to it in one of your pockets. It\u2019s amazing how you instinctively put it in there despite you not really ever expecting to come back here.\n\nYou open the front door and find that your home has not been abandoned, you also see your sister Kelly standing front of you holding a shotgun.\n\n\u201cI heard you clomping out there on the steps. Figured you might be one of those psychos or something. Didn\u2019t expect to see you though.

You underestimate my mercy.\u201d Kelly says with a smile and that\u2019s when you know this is going to end badly for you.\n\nYou attempt to go for your pistol, but Kelly already has the advantage.\n\nKelly fires and a slug hit your chest, shattering bones and vital internal organs like your heart.

You make sure nobody has seen the pair of you enter and then lock the door.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026I can\u2019t believe you felt this way about me darlin\u2019.

So it\u2019s predictable that he doesn\u2019t even question the unlikelihood of any of this at all.\n\nHe wastes no time in putting down his rifle and unzipping his pant. It\u2019s an unimpressive sight. It\u2019s even more unimpressive when you\u2019re on your knees, eye level to it.\n\n\u201cOh my god, this is gonna be better than drugs!\u201d Dan says even closing his eyes as if preparing himself for the glory that is your mouth.\n\nUnfortunately for him he gets none of that and instead receives a FALCON PUNCH to his balls.\n\nDan\u2019s reaction causes him to practically crumple onto you. He manages to wheeze a few swear, but you then shut him up by smacking his head against the bathroom wall, he groans a bit and still tries to grab a hold of you, but you stop him completely by pistol whipping him in the face until he\u2019s no longer moving.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if he\u2019s dead, but you\u2019re not really paying attention to see if he\u2019s breathing by this point, you\u2019re too busy looking for the keys\u2026jackpot.\nThen you hear some banging on the door and you freeze with your pistol in hand.\n\n\u201cHey, who\u2019s in there? I heard some noise. Is that you blondie?\u201d you hear a voice exclaim.\n\u201c\u2026uh yeah it\u2019s me!

Since you get the impression you\u2019re going to be shooting it out with the rednecks anyway, you take Dan\u2019s rifle over your shoulder.\n\nYou exit the bathroom and look around to see a few of the rednecks still stocking up on some more food. You quicken your pace towards the entrance of the grocery store while attempting to keep your head down so nobody immediately sees you.\n\nWhen you get to the entrance there\u2019s one of the rednecks loading up something in the back of the truck. You think its Wade from earlier.\n\n\u201cEverything come out all right?\u201d he asks meaning he must\u2019ve been the one talking to you from outside the door earlier.\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d you say looking around if there are any others you need to deal with.\n\u201cY\u2019know, maybe you wouldn\u2019t be so backed up if you tried anal.\u201d Wade says with a smirk.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cAss fuckin\u2019, sweetcheeks. It\u2019ll loosen you up back there. I\u2019d be more than willin\u2019 to help you out in that department honey.\u201d Wade says with a grin.\n\nAnd at that point, you\u2019re done with stealth.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s a new hole to loosen up your useless brain matter shithead.\u201d You say pulling your pistol blasting Wade in the head. You don\u2019t wait for the body to fall, you run into the truck.\n\nYou get the truck started and you already hear the shouting and sounds of the rest from the grocery store. These sounds are soon followed by the sounds of bullets hitting your truck as you drive off. You keep your head down as much as possible as the back window is blown out and several sounds of bullets hitting the metal parts of the truck. While you\u2019re glad none of them had the forethought to aim for your back tires, you just hope nobody hit the gas tank.\n\nYour drive through your war-torn town is pretty stressful. Between trying avoid large groups of freaks and abandoned military blockades you are also constantly looking in your rear mirror thinking that you\u2019re going to see Mel\u2019s truck and the rest in pursuit, but that doesn\u2019t happen. You don\u2019t really relax a bit until you manage to get out of town.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, I made it. Fuck yeah I made it!\u201d you shout in triumph as you continue to drive eastward.\n\nYou continue to drive for quite sometime. Maybe its because you never really left your basement, but you never really realized what a rural area you lived in before, a lot of wilderness on either side of you. The roads are pretty clear of traffic; you don\u2019t see anyone else driving in the opposite direction or your direction for that matter. You do see a few abandoned vehicles, but nobody around them. You don\u2019t even see any of the cannibal freaks. Maybe that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nYou pass by a few gas stations, diners and the like and while you do think you notice evidence that there are probably folks at these locations, you\u2019re not exactly in a trusting mood right now and quite frankly you don\u2019t want to deal with anyone. If anything you\u2019re sort of enjoying the solitude that you haven\u2019t had for a few days.\n\nSoon, the day starts to become night and you\u2019re getting pretty tired. You have had a long day of escaping cannibal freaks and rednecks after all. You pull off to the side of the road near the edge of a \u201cwall of trees.\u201d\n\nYou clear off the broken glass from the seat of the truck and lay down to get some sleep, hoping that something doesn\u2019t try to attack you in the middle of the night.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a noise in the distance. At first you think it\u2019s something trying to cause you harm and you sit up with pistol in hand, but then you realize there isn\u2019t anything near you.\n\nHowever upon looking around you do notice something in the sky when even with your half sleepy eyes.\n\nYou step out of the truck and stare towards the westward sky in the distance and see the remnants of a mushroom cloud.\n\n\u201cThey finally went and did it\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nYou guess that it might\u2019ve hit Security City (Good thing you drove east). Who and why it was dropped is unimportant at this point, but you\u2019re not really surprised given how things seemed to be going to shit here and the world in general.\n\nProbably was a small one, since you\u2019re not feeling any aftershocks or anything, but you are somewhat concerned if you\u2019re within a lethal radiation zone. You suppose you\u2019ll find out in the days to come, but that leads you to your more immediate concern of survival, namely you\u2019re hungry and thirsty.\n\nYou check what those rednecks managed to load up on the back of the truck and hope that not all of it needs a can opener.\n\nYou see that a lot of it is cans, but fortunately some of them already have ring pulls on them. Other cans have suffered damage from the bullets that went through them. You suppose if you got desperate you could always suck out the remaining soup through the bullet holes.\n\nYou do find a couple bags of beef jerky, which is as quick of a meal as anything. You look to see if they loaded up anything to drink, but all you\u2019re finding is cheap beer. You\u2019ve actually never drank alcohol before, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers so you sit on the tailgate eating your jerky, drinking your beer and pondering your potentially grim future.\n\nWhile it\u2019s good you have some sustenance, it\u2019s not going to last long. Your truck only has around a half a tank of gas and the ammo you\u2019ve got is what\u2019s left in your respective weapons. Hell you don\u2019t even have an extra set of clothes anymore.\n\nYou have no idea where you\u2019re going to go. You suppose continuing east might be your best bet, but. this isn\u2019t even taking into consideration the sort of people you\u2019re possibly going to run into and if those infected freaks aren\u2019t running around elsewhere.\n\nWith all these variables weighing on your mind, things aren\u2019t looking so good right now\u2026\n\n\u201cHey! Hey miss! Did you hear a loud noise?\u201d a voice shouts.\n\nYou spin your head to your left with your hand instinctively reaching behind you to pull your pistol, but you see a male and female couple probably a little younger than yourself wearing large backpacks. They\u2019ve just come out of the \u201cwall of trees\u201d and they don\u2019t look threatening, but you never know. In any case they don\u2019t seem to realize you\u2019ve got a pistol behind you, though the fact that you\u2019re partially covered by the pick up truck\u2019s walls along with some bags might help.\n\n\u201cSure, it woke me up. Where are you coming from?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, we got a campsite nearby. We\u2019ve been sort of roughin\u2019 it for about a week. No technology like cellphones or laptops. It\u2019s been sort of liberating in a way.\u201d\n\u201cHm, yeah you never know when you might need to know how to get along without the creature comforts. Where\u2019s you vehicle though, you couldn\u2019t have walked all this way and I don\u2019t see any roads leading off into the wilderness nearby.\u201d\n\u201cSure there is, look in front of you a few feet away.\u201d\n\nYou look and sure enough the man is correct, there is a little dirt road that leads into the trees. You probably didn\u2019t notice it last night because you were tired and you didn\u2019t notice it this morning because you were more focused on the nuke that went off in the distance.\n\n\u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t go very far in, but it was a good place to pull into so as not having to park on the side of the road. Anyway we\u2019re going to be heading back to Security City soon, we both got classes starting on Monday.\u201d The guy says.\n\nYou take another bite of jerky and drink of beer before breaking the unfortunate news to them.\n\n\u201cYeah well I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. That noise you heard? A nuke just got dumped on Security City.\u201d You say flatly.\n\nAt this point the couple look at each other in disbelief.\n\n\u201cBullshit, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The guy says.\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t need to believe me, but I\u2019ve got no reason to lie about something like that to two complete strangers. You said you\u2019ve been fairly isolated from the world for the past week, well there was some serious shit going down this week. I should know I had to deal with it. Trust me, if things had been different I wouldn\u2019t be stuck out here in the middle of nowhere eating jerky and drinking beer. I\u2019d be in the comfort of my basement.\u201d You say.\n\nAt this point the guy still isn\u2019t sure whether you\u2019re telling the truth, but the girl starts to break down a bit.\n\n\u201cOh god\u2026every time we tried to listen the car radio, all we got was those fucking Ground Zero shelter ads! She\u2019s probably telling the truth! Oh shit! No!\u201d she exclaims and begins hyperventilating.\n\u201cHoney, calm down we don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point the girl begins to cry about her friends and family while her boyfriend attempts to console her. It isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cWell look at it this way, you avoided getting nuked and you\u2019ve probably got still got some supplies left over and you\u2019ve got all that really useful wilderness gear right?\u201d you say eating the last bit of jerky.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah, look just don\u2019t talk to us anymore.\u201d The guy says still trying to calm his crying girlfriend.\n\nYou throw away the bag and down the remaining beer from the can.\n\n\u201cHow much gas does your vehicle have?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?! This is a fucking nightmare!\u201d the man says while his girlfriend continues to be weak.\n\nYou crush the can and toss it in the middle of the street. You briefly think about not doing it, but then you think this is survival.\n\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse for the both of you.\u201d You say and pull your pistol and shoot the man in the chest.\n\nHe falls to the ground and the girl now goes from crying to screaming though she\u2019s so terrified she doesn\u2019t attempt to run.\n\n\u201cBitch, stop your goddamn screaming RIGHT NOW before I shove this gun in your mouth and shoot a load so hot down your throat that it\u2019ll be the last time you ever give head again.\u201d You say walking towards the scared girl.\n\nYour colorful threat works and the girl just stifles her screaming to annoying whimpers. You look down at her boyfriend who is most certainly dead. You don\u2019t feel anything about it either. You don\u2019t feel joy, but it\u2019s just nothing.\n\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019re going to take your backpack and throw it in the truck, then you\u2019re going to take his pack and toss it in the truck too. Then we\u2019re both heading to your campsite where I\u2019m going to take whatever I think I\u2019m going to need. And if you\u2019re lucky, you might come out of this alive. Now come on.\u201d\n\nAs you bully your new captive into doing your bidding, you think if this is how things are going to be from now on. In your mind you justify your actions as ones of survival, though you were still pretty quick to shoot her boyfriend.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re just having a bad week and something had to give.\n\nIn any case things are starting to look up\u2026 or at least for you they are.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Wanted: Bandit Blondie\n\n\nThe future\u2026\n\n\u201cGive it up Blondie, you got nowhere to go and you\u2019re surrounded!

Come and get my body bitches.\u201d You yell, fire your pistol in the air and then fall backwards so they can see your body fall in the view of the window.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it, she offed herself.\u201d Someone shouts.\n\u201cMove it, but remain alert! It could be a trick!\u201d Justice shouts.\n\nWell at least Justice is still thinking a bit, but he\u2019s still severely underestimating you if he thinks he\u2019s got you trapped. You wouldn\u2019t have run in here had you not had a plan. This isn\u2019t just some random abandoned house, it\u2019s one of the many places you store supplies. Some of which are fully loaded weapons.\n\nSeveral bounty hunters cautiously enter the front entrance of the house, but it doesn\u2019t do them any good when you cut down most of them with an assault rifle before they can take cover.\n\nHearing more pour in from the back, you throw a smoke grenade to cover yourself and retreat elsewhere into the house where you have a trapdoor that leads under the house.\n\n\u201cGoddamn fucking smoke. Can\u2019t see shit!\u201d someone shouts.\n\u201cFuck this, burn it all down.\u201d Another says and you hear footsteps starting to exit the house from above you.\n\nMeanwhile you continue to crawl under the house, eventually making your way under the backsteps. There you see in the area is Bounty Bill and a few other hunters.\n\n\u201cShit, she\u2019s right there!\u201d Bounty Bill shouts before you riddle him and his buddies with bullets. Doesn\u2019t take long before more hunters run around from the front to the back to flank you.\n\nYou barely manage to escape unscathed, but fortunately luck is still with you this day. You notice the house is starting to emanate black smoke from the front and the distinct smell of fire is now in the air. You also hear a vehicle revving up.\n\nYou pick up a couple of the pistols off the dead and cautiously head around the front of the house. You get there just in time to see Justice driving away like a little bitch. However, revenge is still very much here and Mary Liberty opens fire. You feel a painful sensation of a bullet going into your left leg.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d you exclaim and dive for cover and crawl behind one of many now abandoned vehicles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dead bitch Blondie! You hear me!?!\u201d Mary shouts while spraying your cover with bullets.\n\nYou and Mary have an old fashioned run and duck shoot out for several minutes, however unlike what happens in old movies, it does not ultimately result in some physical catfight with lesbian undertones where upon you proceed to rip each other\u2019s clothes off.\n\nYou just manage to get lucky again and shoot Mary in her right tit causing her to go down with the utterance of swears coming from her mouth.\n\nYou limp over to where she fell and see she\u2019s still trying to grab her pistol that she dropped. You shoot her in the hand blowing off a few of her fingers and causing her hand to recoil and she screams in pain. You pick up the pistol and train your own weapon on her. Already having a hard time breathing from the hole in her chest, she clutches her bloody hand with the other.

The bullet went through so at least you don\u2019t need to worry about digging something out. You\u2019re just glad she wasn\u2019t using hollow points and tie off your leg with your over shirt.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re sure Justice will be back to chasing you around when he manages to scrounge up some more mooks.

You don\u2019t even see anyone really around.\n\nEventually you approach the far end of the park, and there you see a trailer, which seems to stand out near a large open field. You\u2019re guessing this one is it.\n\nYou park and approach the trailer and when you try the door that when you realize that you don\u2019t have a key for this place. Donna apparently didn\u2019t develop the bad habits of Julie either since the door is firmly locked.\n\n\u201cDamn. (Sigh)\u201d you say to yourself realizing that your choice is either wait all day in your vehicle, or maybe go back to to the manager who might have a spare key, though you\u2019d rather not deal with him again.\n\n\u201cHey darlin\u2019 never seen you before here! My name\u2019s Jed!\u201d a voice says.\n\nYou turn around and see a lanky redneck who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cOh. Hey.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHmm, you sure are beautiful. Yer even prettier than that girl that just moved in this trailer. You a friend of hers?\u201d\n\u201cSister actually. Does the manager have spare keys to the trailers?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThat mean old bastard? Yeah, but if you need that open, you don\u2019t need to go all the way back to him, here I can open it.\u201d\n\nJed walks past you and pulls out some sort of tool and starts fiddling with the lock.\n\n\u201cHey, wait a minute, are you picking the lock?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I ain\u2019t ticklin\u2019 it honey. Letssee\u2026yeah\u2026easier than breakin a virgin.\u201d Jed says as the door easily opens for him with a click.\n\n\u201cThere you go sweetheart. So said that girl livin\u2019 here now is yer sister? Guess good breedin\u2019 runs in yer family.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah guess so. Thanks, but I really want to just get all my stuff in and rest.\u201d You say and turn to your car and there you see a huge man just staring at you like a gargoyle. It actually startles you, which Jed notices.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be afraid of him honey, that\u2019s just my brother Hugo. He\u2019s dumber than a bag of rocks, but he\u2019s strong as hell. In fact he can carry yer bags in for ya.\u201d\n\nAt this point Jed is getting uncomfortably close to you as he speaks and you\u2019re starting to feel on edge with these two.\n\n\u201cLook I thank you both for your help, but I really would like to be alone please.\u201d You say firmly.\n\nJed looks at his brother then at you.\n\n\u201cWhatever you say honey. Let\u2019s go Hugo.\u201d Jed says and the pair of them slowly leave and eventually disappear behind another trailer.\n\nNo longer being gawked at by the locals, you grab your bags from the car and haul them into the trailer.\n\nWhen you get inside, you see that it isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s definitely cheap looking, but it\u2019s serviceable. You drop your bags by the sofa and quickly check the other areas like the bathroom and what you guess is a bedroom where Donna will sleep.\n\nJust as you\u2019re turning around to check the kitchen at the other end, the door opens up and your heart sinks when you see Jed entering with what looks to be duct tape. He looks at you and a deranged smile is across his face.\n\n\u201cNow I already know what\u2019s goin\u2019 through yer head blondie, cause I\u2019ve done this a million times. Yer first instinct is gonna be to scream and make a fuss. Well lemme tell ya right now. Ain\u2019t nobody gonna help yah. Most of \u2018em are at the carnival, an the few that ain\u2019t are either still passed out or ain\u2019t gonna give a shit. Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\n\nDespite Jed\u2019s warnings, you do the opposite of what he says and scream as loud as you can anyway, while running back into the bedroom in an attempt to look for anything to defend yourself. Jed wastes no time in following.\n\nUnfortunately there isn\u2019t anything in the bedroom for you to immediately use since Donna doesn\u2019t have any of her stuff here. You attempt to pick up the trailer\u2019s TV in desperation, but Jed grabs you and throws you to the bed.\n\nYou struggle, but it\u2019s no use. Jed is a dedicated murdering rapist with a mean streak a mile wide. After giving you a few punches to the face, you start to drift in and out of consciousness.\n\n\u201cHUGO! HUGO! You can stop watchin\u2019 the fuckin\u2019 door and gimme a hand over here with this bitch. I reckon we both got time to have some fun with this one before handing her over to ol\u2019 doc.\u201d Jed exclaims while ripping your clothes off.\n\n\u201cSee Hugo? Told ya sticking around here would be better than the carnival.\u201d\n\nIn your haze, you feel the violations at first. Pain, humiliation and anguish are all abundant at first, but then you go numb and then nothing when you pass out altogether.\n\nDuring your state of unconsciousness you have a brief dream of when you were much younger. When your mother was still alive and she was praising you about how good you are and how she anticipates great things in your future. It\u2019s more of a distant memory than a dream in fact though in any event, it\u2019s a nice \u201cescape\u201d from your horrible reality.\n\nWhen you wake up, you\u2019re groggy, naked, incredibly sore and firmly strapped to a medical gurney of some sort. You also have a ball gag in your mouth. The room you\u2019re in looks to be some sort of basement with a bright light hanging overhead.\n\nThe stench of chemicals fills the air and to your left in a darker corner of the room you see a man in a doctor\u2019s coat hovering over another gurney with a body on it.\n\nNaturally in such a state you start to panic and ineffectively struggle to get free. The \u201cdoctor\u201d hears you and walks over to you.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re up. I\u2019ll have to give you more sedative. When Jed and Hugo brought you in, you weren\u2019t in the best condition, though I\u2019m glad they showed a little more restraint than usual.\u201d\n\nAs you continue to try to struggle and make muted sounds to cry out, the doctor begins fondling you and moving his hands to roam all over your body.\n\n\u201cMmmm, nice. Though I appreciate a pretty face and I get the impression yours would\u2019ve been a lot prettier had they not beat you up so much. Not to mention they both completely wrecked your rectum\u2026I swear what the hell is it with rednecks and their pre-occupation for ass rape? Anyway, if I had the time, I\u2019d probably still shove it in your vertical smile for a while, but sadly I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe doctor goes over to a tray and grabs some sort of syringe he fully intends on use on you and you\u2019ve gone from mere panic to sheer terror.\n\n\u201cReally, you\u2019re luckier than most that come through here. Normally I keep \u2018em awake when I do my work, but I need you unconscious to take out those pretty eyes and other vital organs of yours. Wouldn\u2019t want you thrashing about or blinking to cause me to cut them all up and making them useless.\u201d\n\nYou watch helplessly as the needle goes into your arm. The tears run down your cheeks.\n\n\u201cThere we go. Won\u2019t be long now. (Sigh) I swear it seems like I never get to enjoy my work any more though. I really would\u2019ve liked to have fun with you. Oh well, I\u2019ve got some other things to still look forward to.\u201d\n\nYou drift into unconsciousness again and your life ends where you ironically spent most of your time.\n\nA basement.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Don\u2019t run", "result": "Regardless of what your sister does, you\u2019re not going to get yourself into more trouble by running.\n\n\u201cLook Donna, I can\u2019t stop you from running, but I\u2019m staying here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re supposed to be supportive!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be supportive in your resisting arrest attempt! Now like I said, I won\u2019t stop you, but if you\u2019re going to do it, you\u2019ll be doing it alone.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I should\u2019ve known you\u2019re still the same old goody two shoes that follows all the rules. You\u2019re a goddamn idiot Suzy, one of these assholes just felt me up when he frisked me. You really think if they\u2019re just going to arrest us when they find something? Chances are they\u2019re going to drive us to some secluded area and make us suck their cocks and god knows what else! I\u2019m getting the hell\u2026\u201d\n\nJust as Donna is starting to get up, both cops have taken notice of you two again.\n\n\u201cHEY! I told you to stay put! Don\u2019t give me an excuse!\u201d one of them shouts nearly going for his gun and it\u2019s enough to cause Donna to rethink her actions.\n\n\u201cDespite the pair of you acting mighty suspicious, you appear to be clean and so does the vehicle. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting out of a ticket though!\u201d the cop says and shoves a ticket at your sister who takes it. Looks like Donna had a drug free car after all.\n\nAt this point the cop\u2019s partner says to him that they\u2019re needed at the mall since apparently a small riot has broken out there. You are left with another verbal warning and they drive off.\n\nAs for you and your sister, the pair of you get back in the car without another word and continue your drive to Julie\u2019s house in silence.\n\nWhen you arrive, the place is much more subdued than your used to. You don\u2019t even hear loud music coming from inside.\n\n\u201cNo party going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cProbably will be some folks coming over later. I dunno, even I don\u2019t keep up on it all the time. Anyway, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be wanting to hide away before that happens, so like I said your room will be Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s old office. Julie also wants to talk with you as well, so if you\u2019re actually feeling social you could go speak with her before heading off to planet Suzy.\u201d Donna says coldly.\n\u201c\u2026what the hell? Donna, I know you\u2019re pissed, but I really don\u2019t know why. If it hadn\u2019t been for me stalling you from running, you\u2019d be in for a lot more trouble than just a ticket. I\u2019d say it worked out much better.\u201d You say.\n\u201cRight. Your plan worked. Following the rules always works for you. Your life is so great and that\u2019s why you had to beg to move in here.\u201d\n\u201cUh, you\u2019re living here in JULIE\u2019S house too with no means of support either. I wouldn\u2019t start pointing fingers.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you Suzy. I thought things were going to be different, but I can see that you\u2019re still the stuck up bitch that thinks she\u2019s better than everyone else.\u201d Donna exclaims and storms off leaving you in the car.\n\nSo much for \u201csisterly bonding.\u201d This is really an unfortunate turn of events, but not completely unexpected. Donna\u2019s always been a bit bi-polar with you. One moment she\u2019s saying how much you should hang out and bond and the next minute she\u2019s calling you a stuck up bitch that doesn\u2019t know how to have fun.\n\nThe girl has some serious self-esteem issues. Really you have no idea why she still acts the way she does. Mom is dead and so is dad. Who is there to rebel against anymore? From some of what she said earlier it almost seems like she parties out of habit more than great desire anymore.\n\nYou pull your bags out of the car and head on inside. The front room is messy, but not overly so. Your sister is nowhere to be seen, but there are a couple of people you don\u2019t know sitting on one of the couches playing video games. Another one is asleep on the floor. The place smells of spilled beer and none of the people even acknowledge your presence.\n\n\u201cSuzy! You\u2019re here!\u201d a voice suddenly calls out. You look up and see Julie waving from the second floor. She immediately runs down the stairs to greet you close up, nearly tripping in the process.\n\nWhen she gets to you, the years of partying are really starting to take their toll. She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s starting to look like one of those trashy strippers that wears too much make up.\n\n\u201cSuzy, it\u2019s been too long! Give me a hug!\u201d she exclaims and before you can even react, she gloms on to you and gives you a tight squeeze.\n\n\u201cMmmm, you smell so nice. Like strawberries.\u201d She says while rubbing her hands across your back.\n\u201cUh, yeah. Probably the shampoo I used.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping in shape too, guess Bobby was keeping you busy physically. Ha ha ha ha.\u201d Julie laughs and now she starts getting a little too touchy feelie for you. You\u2019ve already had unwanted touching once today, you don\u2019t feel like more.\n\u201cYeah, okay good to see you too. Back up there now. I need some space.\u201d You say and start pulling away.\n\u201cHah same old prudish Suzy. What you think I\u2019m gonna just start sexually assaulting you right here in the living room? Please, I know a girl like you needs to be romanced first!\u201d\n\nJulie jokes, but she\u2019s probably somewhat serious with her playful advances. Shortly after you got with Bobby, Donna told you that Julie spent a couple days crying because she wanted to tell you how she\u2019s always loved you. (You of course weren\u2019t sure why she ever thought you\u2019d be into such a relationship, but apparently before Bobby, everyone just assumed you were a big lesbian.) Of course she quickly went on with her hedonistic life, but you\u2019ve always wondered if she really ever \u201cgot over\u201d you.\n\n\u201cOkay Suzy, I hear you\u2019re planning on sleeping in my dad\u2019s old office. You remember the way right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I think so.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll just walk with you, we need to catch up on so much. I\u2019ve missed you, you know!\u201d\n\nResigning yourself to the fact that you\u2019re going to have to at least be friendly to Julie, you walk with her to your new room. Julie of course is very talkative.\n\n\u201cSo Suzy, speaking of Bobby, did you make up with him yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo and I doubt if it\u2019s going to work out anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOhhhh, that\u2019s so sad. You two did make a cute couple in a creepy shut in way.\u201d Julie says and begins rubbing your shoulder.\n\u201cHm, thanks.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell, not to worry, you could meet a new boyfriend right here! Contrary to what you might think, I don\u2019t just have mindless party animals coming over here. There\u2019s actually a wide variety of people that come here to hang out. You could meet that special guy tonight in fact! Or girl\u2026you know whatever\u2026\u201d Julie says trailing off and nervously smiles at you.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not really thinking about that right now, I think I\u2019d rather be by myself for awhile.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOh yeah sure. I understand. But I just want you to know that my house is your house okay? And all the fun that goes on here, well you can have some of that fun too you know?\u201d\n\u201cI know Julie. Thanks for letting me stay here.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem, you were always welcome. Okay well here it is. I\u2019ll leave you to get settled and remember you can always come out and join us later.\u201d\n\nAt this point Julie hugs you again though it\u2019s a quick one this time and briskly walks off.\n\nYou enter the office and see that it is indeed much neater and cleaner than most of the house. Even better that it has a small bathroom attached to it as well, but you knew that since this actually isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve been in here.\n\nYou remember playing tag with Julie when you were in elementary school and you both ran in here. Julie\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t angry though. He even gave you a lollipop from a jar on his desk. Come to think of it anytime he saw you, he was always giving you lollipops. He was pretty nice that way. Shame he died in a car accident just as Julie was starting to get wilder, since even if he did work most of the time, you get the impression Julie might at least had some boundaries during her late teens and onward.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for you to rearrange some things and make yourself at home on the fairly comfortable couch in there.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t take long for you to get back to finishing what Donna interrupted earlier today. (Making sure to lock the door of course)\n\nAfter finishing up and washing up a bit, you hear some music. Sounds like the party is getting started. Continuing to be the introverted personality you usually are, you don\u2019t leave your \u201csafe zone\u201d and go back to playing games on your computer and looking up random shit on the Internet. The more things change the more they stay the same, time passes and it\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve never left the basement!\n\nEventually you get bored doing that and you start looking around the office a bit more. It\u2019s sort of snooping, but then Julie\u2019s dad is dead and you\u2019re sure Julie doesn\u2019t care.\n\nYou start going through the filing cabinets and find that all the paperwork is mainly business files dated back to before Julie\u2019s dad died. Looks like nobody ever bothered to clean any of this stuff out or even go through the stuff.\n\nThe bookshelves aren\u2019t filled with the most interesting of topics. Mostly about economics, business practices, legal things, though some of the books are historical in nature. You don\u2019t see much fiction though.\n\nThe desk just contains regular office supplies. You actually aren\u2019t surprised to find a pistol in there (along with bullets) but after rummaging around a bit you notice a secret compartment in one of the drawers.\n\nYou find a black box and you waste no time in opening it. Inside you find pictures. Pictures of little girls\u2026in fact there are some of YOU! By the looks of them, these were all taken in secret.\n\nNobody is naked in the photos, but given that nearly every single picture of you involves you either sucking or licking a lollipop it\u2019s pretty apparent what the purpose of these were.\n\nSome of these girls are other kids you knew from school and hung out with Julie as well. In fact one of them went missing. Nobody knew who did it, but it was a big deal in town and it probably lead to your mother being even more overprotective of you. And you\u2019re really glad she did since you\u2019re starting to get a sinking feeling about what you\u2019ve uncovered here.\n\n\u201cChrist\u2026\u201d you say going through the photos. You start to wonder now if Julie\u2019s behavior is caused by years of sexual molestation. It would certainly explain a lot.\n\nThen you get a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, it\u2019s me Julie, I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, hold on. Just a minute!\u201d you exclaim as you quickly put the photographs back. You have no idea if you should tell her not, but you open the door.\n\nJulie appears with a bottle of soda and a pizza and walks in.\n\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d stay in here all night, but I thought you might get hungry or thirsty so here you go!\u201d Julie says and places her gifts to you on the desk.\n\u201cOh. Thanks Julie.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026so why\u2019d you take so long in answering the door? You splittin\u2019 the kitten in here or what?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cHah, yeah well busted I guess.\u201d You say with a fake chuckle.\n\u201cSuzy, if you came out and had some fun with the rest of us, that wouldn\u2019t really be necessary you know. I know you probably still miss Bobby on some level and you\u2019ve got needs, but he\u2019s not here and you\u2019d be better off moving on with your life and getting some free dick out there\u2026or pussy\u2026you know whatever\u2026\u201d Julie says obviously still hoping.\n\nGiven how unstable Julie is at times, you almost wonder if you should address what you found at all. Maybe dredging up bad childhood memories isn\u2019t the best thing right now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk to Julie about what you found", "result": "Quite frankly, you\u2019ll still not sure if this is a good idea, but you can\u2019t stay silent about what you know.\n\n\u201cJulie, I\u2019m about to tell you something very important and I think it\u2019s going to cause a lot of emotions, but please bear with me.\u201d You say and then when you see Julie\u2019s eyes light up you quickly clarify your statement.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026not that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026oh\u2026\u201d Julie says disappointed, though she\u2019s going to be even more upset when you reveal what you know.\n\nYou start and stop a couple of times, but eventually you tell her you better just show her. You open the desk back up and hand her the box of photos. Julie goes through them silently for a moment and sits down.\n\n\u201cJulie, I dunno what to say.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to say? It is what it is. (Sigh) I thought I got rid of all this stuff though.\u201d Julie responds.\n\u201cYou\u2026you knew? Why didn\u2019t you ever tell anyone?\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t like I really knew until after he died and by then I didn\u2019t see the point and I thought it might even fuck up the inheritance he left me. Most of the stuff I found when I did go through it weren\u2019t photos like these, but actual magazines or little girl pictures on his computer. I didn\u2019t even know that he was taking photos of you and other friends.\u201d\n\u201cWait. So you never knew until after he died? Are you saying he never touched you?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Never touched me. Never paid much attention to me at all really, he was usually gone on business or otherwise busy as you well know.\u201d\n\nAt this point Julie starts to laugh.\n\n\u201cYou wanna hear something really fucked up?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAfter I found out my dad was a sicko pedo I got angry and cried as you might expect, but I think a small part of me did so, not because of the horror of such a revelation, but because I thought why didn\u2019t he ever show me as much attention? Why these other girls? I was his daughter. Why wasn\u2019t I\u2026(sob) good enough\u2026\u201d Julie starts to break down.\n\nYou\u2019ve never been one to deny how fucked up your family is and you probably have your own set of \u201cdaddy issues\u201d on some level, but right now you don\u2019t think you could have such a twisted way of thinking.\n\nTo be fair to Julie, she probably doesn\u2019t really have some fucked up desire to want to fuck her dad, its just her being fucked up in general. She\u2019s always been so starved for a positive father figure in her life that her mind is bound to go to places that are a little\u2026 well fucked up.\n\nJulie goes into full blown sobbing mode and you realize you\u2019re going to have to be the one to console her now.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026there. There, there now. You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d You say sitting down next to her and patting her on the back. She then of course takes to hugging you while crying.\n\n\u201cI mean in his own\u2026incredibly twisted way he did care about you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell he left you a shitload of money when he died for one thing. He definitely wanted you to make sure you\u2019d be taken care of if he died. I mean that\u2019s more than my dad did.\u201d\n\u201cYour dad wasn\u2019t a fucking pedo.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I mean\u2026look your father obviously must\u2019ve known what he was was incredibly wrong and he tried to shield you from it by NOT molesting you. His love for you overwrote his sick lust for little girls. It might\u2019ve even been why he was distant. I mean things could\u2019ve been A LOT worse for you if he had taken an unhealthy interest in you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I suppose you\u2019re right. But I just wish\u2026someone could\u2019ve been there for me growing up. I wish my mom hadn\u2019t died when I was little. Maybe it could\u2019ve made the difference of me actually not squandering my youth and acting like brainless whore. All I fucking do is live a shallow existence of hedonism. I don\u2019t even feel good about it anymore. It\u2019s just a never-ending void. I could\u2019ve applied myself to SOMETHING and now the inheritance is starting to run out and I have absolutely no goddamn skills whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThis is pretty heavy stuff coming from Julie. She rarely if ever takes about anything deep, and given how personal all this is it\u2019s a bit out of character. Still, you aren\u2019t entirely surprised she\u2019s coming out to you about it. Crushes aside, Julie probably has always felt a bit of a bond with you due to both your mothers dying early and having distant fathers. True your sister is more in line with her lifestyle, but you grew up with her and were friends with her first and its obvious that deep down she\u2019d like to have something stable in her life.\n\nIn a weird way you both have also shut yourself in from the outside world. Julie may be fucking strangers and partying all the time, but other than that, she barely interacts with the real world in any meaningful way. She was just a \u201cbasement dweller\u201d with a shitload of cash.\n\nIn any event you continue to speak with Julie who reveals more about what she knows. She keeps apologizing for her dad taking pictures of you, but you tell her to forget about that now.\n\nShe goes on to say she doesn\u2019t know anything about Vanessa, the little girl in one of the pictures that went missing later. She says she barely remembers ever playing with her. (And to your knowledge you never played with her either).\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t think he had anything to do with her disappearance?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know everything about my father\u2019s sick habits. I mean I know he looked at pictures obviously, but I can\u2019t say if I found anything more than that. Like I never found any hardcore kiddie porn involving actual sex. Though to be honest, it got to a point where I\u2019d found so much that I didn\u2019t want to look anymore. Hence why this office has never really been touched.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cHrm. Well I didn\u2019t find anything else other than these photos.\u201d\n\nYou take a glance through the photos again and shake your head realizing that this is probably just going to be one of those dark mysteries of what really happened to Vanessa.\n\nSince neither one of you are really willing to play great detective and don\u2019t want to dwell on this anymore, you and Julie destroy the photos. Afterwards you figure Julie will want to go back to her party since she\u2019ll want lose herself in an alcohol and sex filled night as usual, but this situation has put her out of the mood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure whoever is out there will have fun whether I\u2019m there or not. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the mood. Can I just spend time with you? We could eat this pizza and just talk like how we used to remember?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cWell, I suppose that would be okay.\u201d You answer.\n\nSo you and Julie spend the remainder of the night talking. It really isn\u2019t all that bad. It doesn\u2019t even get weird with Julie trying to push for something more, she just maintains a friendly demeanor and nothing more than that. Her spirits are certainly brighter.\n\nEventually you start to get sleepy and even Julie begins to get tired.\n\n\u201cI hate to stop our discussion, but I\u2019m really getting sleepy. It was sort of an eventful day for me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure, I understand, but um\u2026could I ask just one little favor?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u2018What?\u201d\n\u201cWell, other than the situation that lead to our talk, I really feel like this was a very positive experience for me. I mean like in a long time. I feel like I\u2019ve reconnected with a friend again. I mean REALLY reconnected.\u201d\n\u201cJulie\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know where you think I\u2019m going with this, but can I just sleep here tonight? I just enjoyed our time together that I don\u2019t really want it to end yet, even if we\u2019ll both be asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno\u2026where are you going to sleep?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that couch folds out into a bed. I'll just sleep with you!\u201d\n\nYou give Julie a look of disapproval and disbelief.\n\n\u201cI mean\u2026oh you know what I mean! I\u2019ll just take one side of it! Please! I really won\u2019t try anything honest!\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually considering this\u2026\n\n\u201c(Sigh) All right, but ONLY because this is all my fault for dredging up bad memories in the first place and you\u2019re a bit emotional right now. You can sleep on the left side, but DO NOT expect this to be a regular thing and DO NOT think that your hands or any other parts of your body are going to just roam over to my side in the middle of the night. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you what will happen if that happens.\u201d\n\u201cNo, and I swear I won\u2019t try anything! Okay, this is gonna be fun! Like a sleep over! Why didn\u2019t we ever have one of those when we were little?\u201d\n\u201cBecause my mother was overprotective and I\u2019m starting to think things could\u2019ve been a lot worse for me if she hadn\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nWasting no time, Julie helps you fold the couch out and gets into the bed. You hesitantly get in on the other side and remind Julie not to touch you. Julie though just seems to be thrilled you\u2019re in the same bed together.\n\nDespite your concerns, you eventually fall asleep\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "TUESDAY\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Suzy\u2026\u201d you hear a voice whisper.\n\u201cMgh.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cSuzy\u2026get up\u2026I have to go pee!\u201d the voice says again. Your eyes are still closed, but you recognize it as Julie\u2019s.\n\n\u201cGuh. Well go! Why do I have to get up?!\u201d you say angrily with your eyes still closed.\n\u201cWell because you arm is wrapped around my waist and your leg is intertwined with one of mine that\u2019s why!\u201d\n\nNow you open your eyes and realize what Julie has just described is true. Julie looks at you over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cHey don\u2019t blame me, I stayed on my side of the bed. I\u2019d enjoy this longer, but I really gotta pee!\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d You say and remove yourself from your entanglement from Julie\u2019s body. Julie smiles at you and then heads to the bathroom.\n\nGreat, now she\u2019s going to read something into it. Though you do wonder how the hell you got into a spooning position with her. Maybe you were dreaming about Bobby.\n\nSpeaking of Bobby, while you\u2019re checking the time on your cell phone, you see that he\u2019s left messages again. After you recent \u201cnight cuddling\u201d with Julie, you think it might be best if you do call Bobby if only to deter Julie from getting any ideas.\n\n\u201cHello? Bobby?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Bobby answers. He sounds pretty flat.\n\u201cWell you called me, so I assume you wanted to talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I did, I wanted to talk to you yesterday about something else, but I\u2019ve changed my mind about some things since then. So I\u2019ve got something new to tell you, and given that you didn\u2019t bother to talk to me yesterday I think you\u2019ll be fine with it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about us. Breaking up for good. It\u2019s obvious that this isn\u2019t working. I tried to bring you into my world, but you just refuse to meet me half way.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you\u2019re hearing this!\n\n\u201cMeet you half way? You want me to be one of your wives in your fucked up religious cult compound that\u2019s what you want! Face it, you\u2019re not going to give up your sister Diana and that bitch would kill me as soon as I stepped foot in that place!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026you obviously have valid points, so why are you arguing with me on this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re trying to make out like I\u2019M the bad guy here! I\u2019m not the human sacrificing cultist Bobby and yet I looked past that because I loved you! You say I didn\u2019t try to meet you half way? I proposed long ago that we BOTH leave our fucked up families behind and start a new life together! I was willing to change, YOU weren\u2019t!\u201d\n\nAt this point there is a long pause.\n\n\u201cWell? Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, except\u2026it was just too much. Guess I take after my dad after all. I\u2019m sorry, but my God and family come first. Even before you. I\u2019ll always remember\u2026the good times we had. May Tiamat\u2019s Chaos take mercy on you.\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck you and Tiamat!\u201d you exclaim and hang up.\n\nIts weird, but you start to sob a little bit. You sort of knew your relationship with Bobby was on borrowed time anyway, but it still hurts now that it\u2019s officially over. He was your first love after all and now that\u2019s gone.\n\nMeanwhile Julie is standing in the bathroom door watching you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I heard some of that\u2026and I\u2019m truly sorry about you and Bobby. Really, I mean that. You\u2019re a kind and decent girl with many wonderful qualities. He had a treasure in you and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s lost.\u201d\n\nHard to tell if Julie\u2019s just trying to flatter you or she really does mean it, but either way it\u2019s still nice to hear right now.\n\n\u201cDid you want to talk about it?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cNo, not really. It\u2019s over and that\u2019s that. Best to not dwell on the past and move on right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cProbably. Well I should probably see how much damage my home is in from last night and see who\u2019s still lingering around. I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ll come with you. I mean I live here too now, I might as well help you clean up. Besides, for the first time I think being alone might be a bad idea. I\u2019m just going to end up dwelling on Bobby. I need to keep my mind on other things right now. I probably should try to make up with Donna as well. We kind of argued yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I wondered what happened about that. When she stormed in yesterday I asked about you and she mumbled something about you being a bitch. Then later at the party I asked again about what happened and she still never answered.\u201d\n\u201cNothing really happened, she just jumped down my throat for a perceived insult, but I guess I should make the peace being the older sister and all.\u201d\n\u201cSee? This is why you\u2019re so wonderful!\u201d Julie smiles and the pair of you exit your room.\n\nThe house actually isn\u2019t in bad shape. Julie remarks that usually the parties only get really out of hand on Saturday and Friday nights. She also remarks that she thinks this the first time in quite awhile that she woke up without a hang over since she didn\u2019t really drink as much since she was mainly with you the whole night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre feeling, but I have to say it isn\u2019t an unpleasant one.\u201d Julie says.\n\nFrom the living room you hear the sounds of a vacuum as well as a TV.\n\n\u201cWho the hell would be vacuuming?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cDonna?\u201d the moment you say that, you and Julie both look at each other and say \u201cNah.\u201d\n\nWhen you arrive in the living room, you see a man probably about your age calmly vacuuming as he periodically looks at the TV screen, which is one of those Ground Zero infomercials. There are actually a couple of other people in the room flopped out on the furniture or on the floor still asleep, but the man merely vacuums around their sprawled out legs or bodies. You and Julie find the sight to be quite the peculiar one.\n\nHe notices you both and turns off the vacuum.\n\n\u201cOh hey. You\u2026you\u2019re the owner of this house correct?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYes I am, who are you?\u201d Julie answers.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m Johnny. Sorry if I woke you and your girlfriend up, but I couldn\u2019t in good conscience leave your house in such a mess. So I found your vacuum and tried to clean up a bit. Sort of a wild party last night huh?\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cEh, had wilder. Never had a guest actually clean up though. Kinda weird, but hey I won\u2019t turn it down. I don\u2019t remember you from last night; though I have so many people at my parties I never know half of them anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not very memorable anyway. I\u2019ve always kind of just blended in with the crowd. I heard about this party from a friend and figured I\u2019d come since I don\u2019t get out much. Did you want me to leave?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t make difference to me. Like I said, I\u2019m not going to turn down a guest that helps clean up.\u201d\n\nJohnny nods and returns to cleaning up, while Julie turns back to you.\n\n\u201cHrm, he\u2019s an odd one, but at least he\u2019s helpful. Anyway, let\u2019s go check and see if Donna\u2019s upstairs.\u201d Julie says.\n\nYou and Julie leave Johnny to his cleaning to go find your sister. After checking the bedrooms, you don\u2019t find her (Though there are a couple of people still sleeping in said bedrooms) you wonder if she passed out on the lawn or something.\n\nYou and Julie start descending down the stairs.\n\n\u201cI dunno, while I\u2019ve certainly passed out on the lawn, Donna has never gotten that bad. She\u2019s more likely to be in the basement.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess you could look outside and I could look down there for my sister\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly Johnny interrupts.\n\n\u201cExcuse me. Sorry for overhearing, but did you say you were looking for Donna?\u201d\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s my sister.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh\u2026so you must be Suzy. Heard her talk about you last night.\u201d\n\u201cNothing good I\u2019m sure. You know where she is?\u201d you say.\n\u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t. I mean I remember seeing her leave with a couple of guys and another girl last night, but I didn\u2019t know them either. I was under the impression they were going out to get more beer or drugs or something, but they never came back.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head and sigh.\n\n\u201cGreat, she probably got herself fucking arrested by the cops last night.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell we don\u2019t know that.\u201d Julie remarks.\n\u201cMaybe. I guess I\u2019ll know if I get a call from the police station. Whatever, I know she\u2019s like a cat and always lands on her feet, so I can talk to her later.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to still look around the house for her?\u201d\n\u201cWell if she\u2019s here, she\u2019ll probably turn up while I\u2019m cleaning this place a bit.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m heading back upstairs to get those assholes out of my bed and clean up whatever mess is up there.\u201d\n\nJulie heads back upstairs nodding to Johnny who is now picking up garbage by hand and putting it in a bag. He nods to you briefly and continues his work.\n\nWell mind numbing clean up work should certainly help keep your mind off Bobby (and the possibility of Donna being in jail) you\u2019re just wondering if you should help Julie or Johnny.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Julie", "result": "While Johnny seems okay, you don\u2019t know him and you\u2019re not in the mood to make new acquaintances, so to prevent the risk of him suddenly becoming more talkative to you, you pass Johnny and head upstairs to help Julie.\n\n\u201cHey! Not cool Julie, we were asleep!\u201d you hear a voice say.\n\u201cYeah and nobody has sex in MY bed unless I\u2019m actually in it!\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cWell, you can still join us like last time\u2026\u201d another voice says.\n\u201cGet out!\u201d\n\nThis order is followed by the sounds of something falling on the floor, and then followed by some complaints.\n\nSoon you see a disheveled man and woman both putting some clothes on as they exit the room. They walk past you, grumbling the whole time about Julie not being cool about the situation.\n\nAs they walk out the front door, they end up waking up another guest who was sleeping in one of the chairs downstairs. He looks at his watch and exclaims \u201cShit!\u201d and rushes out the door as well. Johnny briefly looks at them and then looks up at you with a faint smile and continues to quietly clean up.\n\nYou enter Julie\u2019s room and see her stripping the bed.\n\n\u201cWell, could\u2019ve been worse I suppose. I thought you were cleaning up downstairs.\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cI figured I\u2019d help you up here.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOh, well thanks.\u201d\n\u201cPlus, I dunno, but that Johnny guy is sort of weird.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, yeah, but no weirder than some of the other people we\u2019ve both known.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but there\u2019s something about him\u2026I can\u2019t place my finger on it. I\u2019m just not getting the best of vibes from him.\u201d\n\u201cWell he did say he didn\u2019t get out much. Maybe he\u2019s just awkward around people. I think you know a little about that.\u201d Julie says smirking.\n\u201cHeh, very funny. So did you want me to get started on the other rooms?\u201d\n\u201cYeah just pick up any trash you might find and throw that away in a trash bag. There should be some up here in the hallway closet. Don\u2019t worry about the bathroom, I\u2019m sure its suitably disgusting, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking you to clean it. Hey, maybe I can get Johnny to do it. Ha ha!\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Donna\u2019s room?\u201d\n\u201cWell, normally I leave her shit alone so she has the privacy of cleaning it herself if she so desires. Of course I don\u2019t think picking up a few beer cans that might be in there to be an invasion of privacy. So use your judgment.\u201d\n\nSo you do exactly what Julie says. You start picking up cans and other refuse into a trash bag. Despite Julie\u2019s warnings, you check the bathroom anyway and it isn\u2019t quite that bad so you do a little cleaning up there as well.\n\nEventually you make your way back to Julie\u2019s room where she\u2019s still straightening things out there.\n\n\u201cYou know normally I never bother to do this much cleaning, but I guess that\u2019s one of the advantages of not being hung over when you wake up in the afternoon. You finished already?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cJust about, even worked on the bathroom a little. Wasn\u2019t that bad in there.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it, did you clean up Donna\u2019s room?\u201d\n\u201cNo, decided to stick with your policy of non-interference.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. (Whew) I\u2019m used to playing hard, but not working hard. I\u2019m taking a break.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I think I\u2019ll join you.\u201d\n\nJulie lies down on her now fresh-sheeted bed, while you sit in a chair.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here, you could stretch out.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cHm, I\u2019m good. And I think we\u2019ve spent enough time in beds together for a while.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cAfraid you might get the sudden urge to spoon me again huh?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I dunno how I got in that position, but I probably was dreaming or something.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMostly or something.\u201d Julie continues to prod. \u201cYou had me in a pretty good grip and I didn\u2019t say this before, but I was wide-awake for a good ten minutes enjoying it before I had to really pee. And during that time, you were also grinding your body into mine and you even gave me a peck on the ear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Get out of here! You\u2019re making this up!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I like guys!\u201d you protest.\n\u201cI never said you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying that on SOME level, you might like the female form as well. It\u2019s okay you know.\u201d\n\u201cThe only female form I like is my own.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really mean to say you\u2019ve never fantasized about another woman? I\u2019m not even talking about me, I\u2019m talking about any woman.\u201d\n\u201cNope, can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never found any woman attractive?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s different than wanting to fucking another woman. I mean sure, if you want an example I always thought my older brother Ben\u2019s wife Moonshadow had pretty eyes.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, interesting. She was part black wasn\u2019t she? Maybe you just got a thing for dark meat.\u201d Julie laughs.\n\u2018Fuck you Julie. Just fuck you.\u201d\n\u201cHey, whenever you\u2019re ready. And given how much you were aggressively holding on to me and grinding your body into mine, I at least I know you\u2019re a top now. Didn\u2019t get that vibe from you before. That\u2019s kind of hot really.\u201d\n\nAt this point you can\u2019t help but laugh though it\u2019s a semi-nervous laugh due to feeling a little weird about Julie\u2019s suggestions about you. You attempt to change the subject.\n\n\u201cWell at least this has gotten my mind off other things. Still need to smooth things over with Donna though. No call yet, so I\u2019m guessing she didn\u2019t get arrested. I\u2019m just hoping it isn\u2019t something worse. I might call her soon; even if she is pissed at me at least I\u2019ll know where she is. Has she ever disappeared like this before?\u201d\n\u201cOh sure. I mean she goes over to hang out with other people; she\u2019s probably over at one of their houses. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be back later today\u2026is that Johnny guy still downstairs?\u201d\n\u201cDunno. I can check.\u201d\n\nYou exit Julie\u2019s room and look into the living from the second floor. The TV is still on (And still playing an infernal Ground Zero infomercial) but Johnny isn\u2019t anywhere in sight. Looks like the living room is clean though, even the last of the sleeping \u201cguests\u201d are gone. You call out his name, but there is no answer.\n\n\u201cNope, he\u2019s gone. Looks like everyone is gone.\u201d You say entering Julie\u2019s room again.\n\u201cOh well. With as helpful as he was cleaning up I hoped I could get him to drag these dirty sheets and blankets to the washing machine. You gonna help?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I could, but I probably should be searching for a job. I have a terrible habit of not focusing at the best of times on that.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve ever looked for one\u2026and I probably should start doing so. Like I said yesterday, my inheritance isn\u2019t going to last forever. I won\u2019t keep you though, you\u2019ve been a big help already and I can handle taking some sheets down to the washing machine.\u201d\n\nYou suddenly get the idea that maybe the task wouldn\u2019t seem quite as bad if you did it together. To be honest you wouldn\u2019t mind her with you while you look if only because you still don\u2019t want to be by yourself where you can start dwelling on Bobby again or worse trying to call him.\n\nOf course you might end up just goofing off with Julie if she\u2019s around thus procrastinating and making the goal of searching for a job pointless.", "action_results": [{"action": "Search for jobs yourself", "result": "\u201cWell, if you want to look for a job, just come in and see me and we can look together.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, maybe. First, I\u2019m going to take these sheets and blankets and throw \u2018em in the wash though.\u201d Julie replies.\n\nThe pair of you head downstairs and part company as you head into your room and she goes into the basement. (It still feels odd to NOT go into the basement when heading to your room)\n\nYou lay down on your bed/couch, open up your laptop and prepare for the unfun task of looking for a job.\n\nTen minutes in and you\u2019ve already gotten off track. You\u2019re playing some flash game, but your mind keeps occasionally thinking about Bobby. You start to get upset again and think about calling him.\n\nYou pick up the phone and think of how you really shouldn\u2019t do this, especially since you fully believe that he was being the asshole in this situation, but you can\u2019t just let it end the way it did. You don\u2019t know why, maybe its because he\u2019s the first guy you\u2019ve ever seriously been with and you can\u2019t quite let go yet.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d Bobby says on the other end of the phone. You\u2019re sort of surprised that he picked up after only two rings.\n\u201cBobby\u2026 I just want to say a few more things\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cSuzy I don\u2019t want to fight with you. So\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Look I just want to say, I\u2019m sorry I insulted your religion. I know how important it is to you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I appreciate that. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want things to end like that last conversation we had. Our time together was special to me and I don\u2019t want those memories to be completely soiled because we had a bad break up.\u201d\n\u201cI agree as well\u2026I know I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, because it only makes this break up even harder, but I ALMOST came close to abandoning everything for you\u2026it just\u2026just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know. It was just too much.\u201d\n\nBobby on the other end of the phone is silent, but you think you hear sniffling. Of course this makes your eyes water too.\n\n\u201cI think\u2026 (sniffle) I think I\u2019m always going to love you Suzy.\u201d Bobby says. \u201cI have to go\u2026.bye.\u201d Bobby says and abruptly hangs up.\n\nNow you\u2019re really upset. You knew you shouldn\u2019t have called. You almost think it was better when you parted thinking he was a complete asshole. He sounded so sad, you wonder if maybe, just MAYBE you could convince him if you went and saw him one more time.\n\nYou get the idea. You\u2019re going to do it, because what you had with Bobby is worth fighting for!\n\nYou leave your room and start shouting to Julie as you go down the basement stairs\n\n\u201cHey Julie! I know you\u2019ll probably think this is a bad idea, but I want to go talk things out with Bobby one last time. He and I have so much history, so do you know if Donna has an extra set of keys to her\u2026 Aaaaaaaahhh!\u201d you scream when you see Johnny standing over Julie\u2019s bloody body with a knife in hand.\n\nJohnny doesn\u2019t even flinch, he just smiles at you like nothing is wrong.\n\n\u201cBobby? \u2026you have a boyfriend? Your sister didn\u2019t tell me that\u2026oh well\u2026\u201d he says flatly.\n\nPanic and fear fill every inch of your body and you instantly turn and run back upstairs.\n\nYou get to the top step and open the door just before you feel a sharp pain strike hard into your back. You manage to keep from falling backwards and instead fall forward so that you\u2019re half way on the basement steps and half on the ground floor.\n\nTrying to fight through the pain, you attempt to stand back up and stumble in the process. Attempting to grab the knife in your back doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nYou manage to get partially down the hallway before Johnny catches up to you again. You are grabbed roughly and then thrown face first into the floor as he twists the knife in your back. You scream out for help, but there is none to be had.\n\n\u201cStop screaming you fucking bitch! Why do you always scream!? I\u2019m doing this for your own good! I can be your boyfriend! I can be a better boyfriend!\u201d Johnny shouts as he attempts to strip off your clothes. The only consolation to your final fate is that you struggle so much that Johnny cuts your throat before he can rape you.\n\nNot that it stops him from doing so after you\u2019re already dead of course.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Ask Julie to search with you", "result": "\u201cMaybe we could look together.\u201d You say.\n\nJulie looks a bit hesitant at your proposal.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I dunno\u2026I\u2019m just not in the mood right now...\u201d\n\u201cCome on Julie, I\u2019ll help. The cleaning can wait.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess it would be good to know what to do and where to start at least. Why don\u2019t you grab your laptop and come back up here and we can get to it.\u201d\n\nYou head downstairs and back to your room where you pick up your laptop. Upon exiting the room, you scream out when you literally bump into Johnny.\n\n\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d you scream and nearly drop your laptop in the process. Johnny doesn\u2019t do anything except stand there.\n\n\u201cSUZY! What\u2019s going on down there?!\u201d you hear Julie shout.\n\n\u201cJohnny what the fuck are you doing creeping around like that?! You scared the shit out of me!\u201d you exclaim backing away into the living room still in a bit of a panic. Johnny doesn\u2019t move he just continues to stand there in the hallway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not creeping. I just finished cleaning the basement, it was a real mess down there.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cI called your name earlier and you never answered!\u201d you say.\n\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t hear you. What\u2019re you getting so excited about?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re fucking creeping around the house like a psycho! I think you need to leave!\u201d you say with authority, but you\u2019re really scared deep down inside.\n\nAt this point Julie has come down the stairs and arrived.\n\n\u201cJohnny, I thought you left. What\u2019re you still doing here?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cNothing, I just finished cleaning your basement. You know I feel like my efforts aren\u2019t being appreciated and you\u2019re not being a good host.\u201d\n\u201cGood host? Alright fine, I thank you for your help, but you\u2019re obviously scaring my friend and the party\u2019s long been over anyway, so get the fuck out.\u201d Julie orders.\n\nWhile you half expect Johnny to show some sort of anger or even get violent, fortunately it doesn\u2019t come to that. He remains completely calm. Like dead featureless expression calm. Which is almost scarier.\n\n\u201cOkay. Sorry I caused distress.\u201d He says and walks past you and Julie (you both give him a wide berth) and goes out the front door. You immediately start locking it up.\n\n\u201cJulie, go lock your back door.\u201d You say busily putting the chains on the door.\n\u201cWow, that guy really got to you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJulie, please just go check your fucking back door!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d\n\nJulie leaves to go just that, but you only end up following her anyway. The backdoor is actually already locked though Julie rechecks it just to be sure.\n\n\u201cSee, we\u2019re safe\u2026shit, Suzy, you\u2019re actually shaking.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m fucking shaking! I just had a goddamn flashback to when my Uncle Ed caught me finding the body parts of his victims! I\u2019m telling you there was something wrong with that guy!\u201d you say still looking around like Johnny is still lurking about.\n\u201cShhh\u2026it\u2019s okay now. He\u2019s gone, and if it makes you feel any better he won\u2019t be allowed in here anymore. Hell we probably won\u2019t see him again anyway.\u201d Julie says placing her hands on your arms in an effort to sooth and calm you down.\n\u201cI think I need to lie down.\u201d You say feeling wobbly and unable to catch your breath.\n\nJulie escorts you back to your room where you lay down on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the mood to look for jobs with you right now Julie.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay Suzy, I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to look for one anyway.\u201d Julie says with a smile.\n\u201cGod, my heart is really racing\u2026I feel like I\u2019m going to pass out.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to get you some water or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t go. Stay with me.\u201d You say grabbing on to Julie\u2019s hand.\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stay here. Whatever you want. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d Julie says squeezing your hand while sitting on the edge of the bed.\n\nYou slowly begin to calm down and eventually you stop hyperventilating. Julie stays with you saying nothing, but just being supportive by sticking with you like a friend should.\n\nYou start to feel safer and close your eyes since the stress has still made you a bit weary. Before you know it you\u2019ve fallen back to sleep.\n\nHours later\u2026\n\nYou wake up and find yourself alone.\n\nYou grab your cell where you left it by the bed last time and see that it\u2019s only a few hours to midnight. (Nobody has tried calling you either.) The odd thing is you don\u2019t hear any music or the sounds of people. Normally Julie would have a gathering by now, and it\u2019s odd that you\u2019re not hearing it.\n\nYou then start to worry if something has happened. Still thinking about your incident with Johnny earlier today, you rush to the desk and grab the pistol you found before and load it up. Your older brother Ben showed you how to handle a gun once, you weren\u2019t exactly very good with it, but you feel safer with it.\n\nCautiously, you open the door and slowly walk out into the hallway looking around you.\n\nYou then hear a male voice coming from the living room.\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up bitch and take it!\u201d\n\n\u201cJULIE!\u201d you scream and run into the living room with your pistol draw and pointed in front of you.\n\n\u201cHOLY FUCK SUZY!\u201d Julie shouts and falls off the couch, dropping her console controller and ducking for cover.\n\nYou then see on her TV screen the origin of the male voice. It\u2019s her character. She\u2019s playing some sort of crime simulator.\n\nNow Julie\u2019s the one with the heart palpitations!\n\n\u201cGoddamn Suzy, you scared the shit out of me! What the fuck are you doing with a gun anyway?!\u201d\n\u201cIt was in your dad\u2019s desk. Sorry. I just woke up alone and\u2026I guess I\u2019m still a little scared.\u201d\n\u201cWell I was a lot scared when I saw that shit pointed at me! Especially with the game I\u2019m playing, I thought I unlocked some sort of 3D mode for a second.\u201d Julie says with a very small chuckle.\n\nYou apologize again and sit down next to Julie who has recovered and is busily trying to get her bearings again on her game.\n\n\u201cShit, some fucker robbed me while I was distracted. Gonna have to find and chase his ass down now. Wanna help? Got another controller.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll just watch right now\u2026 so no party tonight?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNah, I mean there were some people that showed up earlier tonight, but I told them all to go back home since I cancelled it tonight. I figure after what happened earlier today with you, you could use the peace.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Julie, that was really thoughtful.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Besides, I figure this would be a good opportunity to start that life change like I mentioned before. Still didn\u2019t look for a job though.\u201d\n\u201cHah, well one day at a time\u2026so is Donna here somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cNope, still hasn\u2019t come home yet. I actually tried calling her, but no answer. I guess she\u2019s got it turned off or the battery\u2019s dead. Probably at a club or something .\u201d\n\u201cI hope so\u2026I\u2019m starting to worry now.\u201d\n\u201cI told you she\u2019s probably at a club or something. Like I said before, she doesn\u2019t always sleep here.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe so, but given that that creepy fuck said he saw he last, well it makes me a bit suspicious.\u201d\n\u201cYou still worried about him? Told ya, that guy was just an awkward aspie. Probably just didn\u2019t know how to talk to girls. Here, why don\u2019t you join my game? You\u2019re obviously already in a shooting mood, it\u2019ll take your mind off things.\u201d\n\nTrusting that it couldn\u2019t hurt, you grab a video game controller and start committing virtual homicide on a grand scale. Oddly, it does make you feel a little better and you both play a little past midnight.\n\n\u201cWell, that was fun, I think I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Julie says yawning.\n\u201cReally? Seems early for you.\u201d\n\u201cWell unlike you I haven\u2019t slept, plus I\u2019m not hopped up on designer drugs like I sometimes am when I\u2019m partying. Amazing what being clean for a whole day does to you.\u201d\n\nAs Julie gets up to go to head off to bed, you aren\u2019t exactly tired yet, but you\u2019re still a little nervous about being by yourself.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to ask this\u2026\n\n\u201cJulie?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cCan you sleep with me tonight?\u201d\n\nJulie\u2019s expression to this request says it all.\n\n\u201cWell okay, but stay on your side of the bed and if anything of yours touches anything of mine, you better respect me in the morning.\u201d She says with a big grin on her face.\n\nYou head back to your room Julie taking the pistol with you, which Julie really disapproves of, but doesn\u2019t protest too much since she\u2019s just happy you\u2019re spending yet ANOTHER night in the same bed with her.\n\nAfter locking the door and placing the pistol where you can easily reach it, you get into bed with Julie who to her credit does keep to one side of the bed and quickly fall asleep.\n\nYou\u2019re up for a little while longer, but eventually you feel safe enough to let your guard down and fall asleep as well.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n\u201cRemember, if you act today\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUgh! Shut up! I don\u2019t care about your stupid shelters!\u201d you hear Julie remark.\n\nYou open your eyes and see Julie to the left of you messing around on your laptop. (And clicking off on one of those annoying pop up audio ads)\n\n\u201cHey\u2026when did you get up?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, about an hour ago I think. Didn\u2019t really feel like leaving the bed though, so I just figured I\u2019d stay here and entertain myself on your laptop. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t mess with my bookmarks and setting though.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to accidentally delete anything. I must say though with the extensive number of porn links in your history, I think you might have a real problem.\u201d Julie mocks.\n\u201cMm, bold words coming from a woman who has popped up in several amateur videos on those sites.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHah. I don\u2019t doubt it, but that brings up the question of why would YOU be watching those?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cWho said I did? I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m browsing through the videos and suddenly your ass pops up in a still.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just my ass, how do you know it\u2019s me? Either you don\u2019t or you\u2019ve watched them enough that you know what my ass looks like without even seeing my face!\u201d\n\u201cArgh! I don\u2019t mean literally! I mean YOU pop up, and I\u2019ve seen your face in the stills though once I almost couldn\u2019t tell because it was covered in cum!\u201d you exclaim starting to get agitated.\n\u201cHmm, nice save.\u201d Julie says a little unconvinced.\n\nAlready having expended more energy than you wanted to, you start to sit up and realize you\u2019ve been wearing the same clothes for the past couple days.\n\n\u201cChrist, I really need to take a shower and change these clothes.\u201d You say and get out of the bed.\n\u201cYeah, I think I need to go do that too.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cWell you can go use your own shower. I know we\u2019ve been sleeping in the same bed for the past two days, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be re-enacting a women\u2019s prison shower scene from a movie.\u201d You say laying down boundaries again.\n\u201cHey I think you had that one bookmarked!\u201d Julie says jokingly.\n\nYou shake your head and grab some clean clothes before heading into the bathroom to take a shower.\n\nAfter washing up and changing your clothes, you feel refreshed. When you exit the bathroom, you see that Julie has left, presumably to go wash up as well. You check your phone and once again see nobody has called. You dial up your sister\u2019s number and still no answer. You certainly hope Julie is right about her just sleeping somewhere else. But surely she couldn\u2019t be so pissed at you that she\u2019s moved out could she? All her stuff is still here after all.\n\nYou then hear a loud noise or more like a voice, but you aren\u2019t sure if its coming from inside the house or outside the house. Still paranoid from yesterday, you grab the pistol and cautiously exit your room.\n\nWhen you get to the living room, you deduce the noise is indeed coming from outside.\n\nA quick peek through the window and you see several military men and a couple of military trucks and even an A.P.C.\n\n\u201cATTENTION! THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW AND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW UNDER WATCH BY THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD. A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE WILL SOON VISIT ALL OF YOU AND ASSIST IN ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY NEED DURING THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY. STAY IN YOUR HOMES. DO NOT COME OUT FOR ANY REASON. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Suzy?! You hear that noise!? You got the TV up loud?\u201d Julie shouts from somewhere up on the second floor.\n\u201cNo! The fucking National Guard is out there in force and it looks like we\u2019re under marshal law.\u201d\n\u201cNational Guard? Hold on, I\u2019m coming down\u2026\u201d Julie says.\n\nYou turn the TV on to see if there\u2019s anything about this, but you\u2019re not exactly having any luck. You\u2019re getting a lot of Ground Zero infomercials or news about shit going on elsewhere in the world. Local stations seem to be off the air with an \u201cemergency test\u201d beep but nothing more substantial than that.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\u201cYeah what the fuck IS going on?\u201d Julie asks coming down from taking her shower.\n\u201cI dunno, I might need to check the Internet, not having much luck with the TV. Do we have enough food and water?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell we certainly got some food. Dunno about water though. I mean you can get some from the taps I suppose, but as you might expect I got tons of alcohol. Why?\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cWhy? Because the National Guard just said if we try to leave we\u2019ll probably get shot on sight that\u2019s why! (Sigh) We\u2019re basically prisoners here.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you need to calm down. You\u2019ve been on edge since yesterday. You just said there isn\u2019t a whole lot we can do, so we might as well just relax in the house. I mean really how much different is the day going to be for either of us?\u201d Julie remarks.\n\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026its Donna. I mean she\u2019s still out there. I mean I HOPE she\u2019s still out there. I mean the last thing I did was argue with her. Shit, I\u2019m even a little worried about Peter and Kelly now and I never got along with them either. Still family though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou tried calling either of them?\u201d Julie asks.\n\nOddly you haven\u2019t. You didn\u2019t really have a reason before, but given what\u2019s going on right now, maybe you should.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that Julie. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure, you go check on what family you can and maybe find out more about what\u2019s going on. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to go get a drink.\u201d\n\u201cThought you were turning over a new leaf?\u201d\n\u201cYou just said we were prisoners here. Not much else for me to do is there? Besides, I\u2019m not going to get bombed out of my skull.\u201d\n\nWhile Julie goes and deals with this situation in her own way, you head back to your room to get your cell phone to start calling up your other family members. You try Peter first since you figure he might at least answer.\n\nYou start to call Peter and then you hear a loud clatter from the kitchen. What\u2019s odd to you is that you don\u2019t hear a series of cursing following it; you do think you hear a stifled yelp though.\n\nPanic wells up inside you and you once again head towards where the disturbing sound came from with your pistol pointed in front of you.\n\n\u201cStop fighting me, bitch!\u201d you hear a voice say.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a video game this time.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Julie being held captive by someone you KNEW was no good right from the start. Johnny. He\u2019s got one arm around her waist and another hand with a knife to Julie\u2019s throat. He isn\u2019t calm anymore. His face is displaying a rage and hatred you remember seeing a glimpse of in Uncle Ed when he looked at you during that horrible night with him. Julie\u2019s face is one of absolute terror and tears run from her eyes.\n\n\u201cLet her go you fucking psycho!\u201d you exclaim pointing the gun in his direction.\n\n\u201cOh look, it\u2019s your dyke lover come to rescue you! Fucking whores the pair of you! You think I\u2019m scared just because you got a gun pointed at me? Pfft! Look at you, you\u2019re so scared right now, you can barely aim that thing properly.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. Despite having the gun in your hand, you\u2019re incredibly scared.\n\n\u201cMmm, think I\u2019ll have some fun with you two after I\u2019m done cleansing you whores. Just like I did with your sister.\u201d Johnny exclaims.\n\nYour worst fears are now a reality and it shows in your face. You feel ill and start to shake a bit.\n\n\u201cGuess you two have been so busy rug munching that you haven\u2019t been in the basement lately. Told you it was a mess down there.\u201d Johnny laughs cruelly.\n\nBetween this revelation, Julie\u2019s desperate expression of wanting you to do something, and your own fear, you\u2019re having a very difficult time concentrating.\n\nYou feel like if you shoot, you\u2019re either going to miss Johnny completely and then he\u2019ll kill Julie, or worse you\u2019ll kill Julie for him by accidentally shooting her instead of him. You can\u2019t fuck this up.", "action_results": [{"action": "Just shoot now", "result": "You remember something your brother Ben said once when he was trying to teach you how to use a gun, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to shoot, don\u2019t think about it.

You shoot.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all over so quickly you didn\u2019t even have time to blink.\n\nYou hit Johnny in the forehead killing him instantly. His grip on Julie is dropped as he collapses backwards to the floor.\n\nYou\u2019re still standing there in disbelief with the pistol still in hand, but now dropped to your side. Julie stands sobbing looking at Johnny and then begins to curse at him.\n\n\u201cYou motherfucker! (Sob) You sick fuck! (Sob) Goddamn you!\u201d she exclaims.\n\nYou go up to her in an attempt to calm her down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. He\u2019s dead.\u201d You say and she stops to hug you tightly. Really you\u2019re having a hard time keeping it together yourself, this psycho just admitted to killing Donna and stuffing her body in the basement. You still need to deal with that.\n\n\u201cOh my god Suzy, (Sob) you saved my fucking life! I\u2019ll never forget this! (Sob)\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, just take it easy. (Exhale) Okay normally we\u2019d just call the cops about this, but considering we\u2019re under fucking marshal law right now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option. So we need to get rid of this body ourselves. Julie. Look at me.\u201d You say staring into her eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of most of this, but I need your help. Besides trash bags do you have any tarps or large sheets of plastic? What about a shovel?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026(sniffle) I don\u2019t know. If there is, they might be in the basement. I know there\u2019s a shovel down there.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m heading since I\u2019m going to have to go down there anyway. Julie, why don\u2019t you go lay down in your room? We\u2019re going to get through this okay?\u201d\n\nJulie seems still very shaken by this experience, but nods and believes you. She gives you another hug and then walks off to go lay down. As for you, you\u2019ve got an unpleasant trip to the basement.\n\nYou try to prepare yourself for what you know to be down there, and fortunately the adrenaline of the situation has given you the fortitude and clarity to carry out what needs to be done, but as you\u2019re walking down those stairs, it still doesn\u2019t give you an enjoyable feeling.\n\nWhen you reach the last step, you fully expect to see a floor full of blood and gore, but you don\u2019t see any of that. In fact you don\u2019t even see a body. You can only guess he must\u2019ve hid it down here somewhere.\n\nAs you proceed with the grim task of looking for your sister\u2019s body, you notice that there is an open window down here, which explains how Johnny managed to sneak in here again.\n\nYou find the shovel and take it. You don\u2019t find a tarp, but you figure you can always wrap the body using garbage bags.\n\nThen you notice the washer and dryer\u2026\n\n\u201cOh god\u2026no\u2026Donna\u2026\u201d you say looking away with tears already forming.\n\nYou can\u2019t tell without getting closer and opening them, but both of the door windows to both are covered in blood. You know he must\u2019ve mutilated her body and shoved the pieces of her in both machines. A blood stained axe is also propped up next to them.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but get sick and vomit nearby at the thought of this. You then break down and cry for a moment. You weren\u2019t the closest with her, but you just wish the last moments were at least better. You can\u2019t imagine what her real last moments were like. Or rather you have an idea, but you\u2019d rather not dwell on it.\n\nYou don\u2019t quite have the strength to proceed with the grisly task of cleaning up your sister\u2019s remains right now. You stagger back upstairs with the shovel in hand trying focus on dealing with the body of the murdering fucker who killed her.\n\nYou get back to the kitchen and just stare at Johnny\u2019s body, getting angrier and angrier about how light he got off. Who knows how many others he killed before your poor sister.\n\n\u201cSomeone should fucking chop you up.\u201d You say.\n\nRemembering that you saw some duct tape in the desk in your room, you go back and grab it and then a trash bag from the kitchen.\n\nYou put the bag over Johnny\u2019s head and then tape it around his neck, so more blood doesn\u2019t smear all over the floor when you\u2019re dragging him back to your room. From there, you take him into the bathroom and get his body into the bathtub.\n\nYou then head right back down into the basement and grab the axe.\n\nAs you\u2019re heading back to your bathroom to repay mutilation with mutilation, Julie has come back downstairs to check on you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, what are you doing with that axe?\u201d\n\u201cJulie just go back upstairs, I told you I got this.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to chop up his body? Is\u2026is he in your bathroom right now?\u201d\n\u201cJulie I said just go back upstairs, you don\u2019t need to deal with this, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, I thought you were going to just dig a hole and throw him in it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well that was before I found my sister in fucking pieces in your goddamn washer and dryer!\u201d\n\nJulie places her hand over her mouth and staggers back propping herself up against the wall.\n\n\u201cOh god\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah. This whole day sucks and maybe that dead motherfucker won\u2019t be able to feel the pain of me chopping him up alive, but it\u2019s the only satisfaction I\u2019m going to get\u2026besides with the National Guard out there right now, going outside to dig a hole probably isn\u2019t the best idea now. Better I should wait to do that at night.\u201d\n\nJulie has no words right now, but she\u2019s starting to look at you a little differently. Maybe the combination of killing someone and the emotional trauma of finding your sister chopped up has caused a bit of a snap in your personality. In any case, you\u2019re definitely taking a darker turn here.\n\nSuddenly there is a loud bang on the front door.\n\n\u201cOh shit! Who the hell is that?!\u201d Julie says.\n\n\u201cFuck. That\u2019s probably that government rep the loud speakers outside were saying was going to visit all the homes in the neighborhood. Someone probably heard the gunshot and sent someone here a lot sooner. Shit\u2026shit\u2026gotta think\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cSuzy?! What\u2019re we going to do? Maybe we should just tell them everything that happened! I mean it was self defense, surely they\u2019ll understand that!\u201d\n\u201cJulie, we\u2019re under marshal law. I got a man laying in my bathtub with a bag over his head and my sister is in pieces in the washer and dryer. At BEST we might be able to convince them of this entire outlandish series of events AFTER they arrest us, put us into whatever fucked up military cell they have, suffer hours of interrogation and god knows what else. At worst? They\u2019ll just think we\u2019re a pair of murderesses and execute us immediately without a trial.\u201d You say and then exhale.\n\n\u201cOr\u2026we could try to cover this up and get them the hell out of here as quickly as possible.\u201d You add.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think they\u2019re going to search the house?!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to try to prevent that from happening. Distract them some how so they don\u2019t bother. I mean I suppose we could try to run out the backdoor and over the fence, but I don\u2019t know how are chances would be with that.\u201d you say.\n\nJulie has no answer for you. At this point she\u2019s so scared that whatever you decide, she\u2019ll follow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run out the back door", "result": "There\u2019s no time to talk, you just have to get the hell out of here!\n\n\u201cJulie come on, we\u2019re going out the back and climbing over fence.\u201d You say and the pair of you make your way towards the kitchen.\n\nThe banging on the front door gets louder, but you\u2019ve already left and are in the backyard running for the fence.\n\nYou manage to get to lift yourself up, but not quite over the back fence before you hear several people shouting at you to halt. You also hear Julie screaming.\n\nYou turn your head quickly and see one soldier with his knee in Julie\u2019s back, her face in the grass and a gun pointed at her head. Several other soldiers are pointing their rifles at you and walking towards you.\n\nYou panic and see no good way for this to end if you let them capture you, so you attempt to pull yourself over the fence to continue your escape.\n\nSeveral of them fire and you land on the other side of the fence with several fatal bullet holes in your body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Talk your way out this", "result": "Even if you do run, you could easily bump into more military outside.\n\n\u201cWe need to distract them. Julie, go run up stairs and try to clean up your face a bit and then doll yourself up with make up. Put on something sexy, like lingerie.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cJust do it. I\u2019ll call you when I need you.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJulie, just trust me okay?\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Julie says with a nod and runs off back to her room.\n\nYou run into your bathroom and toss the axe and shovel in there with Johnny\u2019s body and then draw the shower curtain closed.\n\nGrabbing some scissors from the desk, you take your pants off and quickly cut the legs off of them so they resemble shorts and put them back on. You then tear your shirt and tie it up so it\u2019s really accentuating your breasts and exposing your midriff. You then grab some rubber bands and tie your hair in two ponytails on either side of your head.\n\nMore banging on the front door and you run into the kitchen.\n\nYou quickly put the pistol in a half full box of cereal, which you then put back into the cupboard. There isn\u2019t much blood on the floor, but what little there is, you easily wipe up with some water and soap.\n\n\u201cOPEN UP BY THE ORDER OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT!\u201d you hear a voice shout followed by more banging on the door.\n\u201cHold on! Hold on! I\u2019m coming! I\u2019m coming!\u201d you shout, running to the front door.\n\nLooking through the peephole, you see two soldiers and a man dressed in a business suit.\n\n\u201cI really hope these guys are straight.\u201d You say and open the door.\n\nYou open the door and you lean forward a bit and to the side hoping you look seductive rather than ridiculous (It isn\u2019t like you do this a lot). Judging by the brief pause and the stares, you gather that you achieved seductive rather than ridiculous.\n\n\u201cMiss, didn\u2019t you hear us knocking on the door?\u201d the man in the suit asks.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t answer right away, I was just so busy with something and I had to make myself presentable. So how can I help you today?\u201d\n\u201cYou can start by letting us in; we heard a gunshot coming from this direction. Granted that hasn\u2019t been an uncommon sound in other parts of this town, but this neighborhood has been fairly quiet and peaceful otherwise, so we\u2019d like to know if you know anything about it. We already got soldiers searching around your backyard and the immediate area.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I see. Well, you boys come on in and I\u2019ll try to serve you in any way I can. My name is Suzy by the way.\u201d\n\nYou turn around and attempt to put a little swing into your walk. You then you\u2019re your head to look back at them and flutter your eyes a bit. You actually feel really silly doing so, but the grinning expressions you see on the two soldiers suggest that you seem to be doing better than you\u2019d believe.\n\nThe man in the suit tells the two soldiers to stand by the door and he sits down on couch. You then sit close to him.\n\n\u201cOkay, Suzy. You may refer to me as Mr. Zoll. Now you\u2019re aware this town is under marshal law correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we heard loudspeakers outside earlier. It sounded so frightening\u2026 should we be worried?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you specifics about such things, however I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that this town has experienced a vast increase in criminal activity and rioting. More than your police force can handle. So until we get the situation under control again, we\u2019re here to stay.\u201d\n\nActually you weren\u2019t really aware of that, or at least not to the great extent that it was bad enough to call in the National Guard, but you nod and cross your legs and rub your hand over one of them in a manner that catches the attention of Mr. Zoll.\n\n\u201cSo um\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were saying Mr. Zoll?\u201d you ask.\n\u201c\u2026 yeah anyway\u2026so while this is a state of emergency, we don\u2019t want the citizens to feel uncomfortable. We don\u2019t want to just send in soldiers here to search every house for potential troublemakers. I mean this is still a free country and contrary to popular belief, the government is here to help. At least that\u2019s how I have always approached these situations. Much better to work with people than forcing them against their will. Still, as I said, gunfire was heard from this house and we have to investigate. So I\u2019d like to at least ask you questions before deciding if we need to search this house further, you understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, of course I understand. You have such a difficult job trying to keep our wonderful country safe, I will comply will all your wishes and desires.\u201d You say and then place your hand on Mr. Zoll\u2019s knee in the process.\n\nThis is enough to cause him to smile nervously, but takes your hand off at which point you smile and giggle in return.\n\n\u201cOkay first of all you keep using the term \u2018we\u2019 is there someone else here?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. I\u2019ll call her down. Julie! Could you come down here? There is a man that wants to ask us some questions about the gunshot earlier.\u201d you say standing up from the couch.\n\nJulie appears and thankfully the girl has pulled out all the stops. She\u2019s wearing purple lingerie underneath and her legs are covered by purple stocking with garters. She\u2019s also wearing all the usual makeup that makes her look like a cheap whore and that\u2019s definitely a plus right now since everyone is looking at her. Julie walks down the stairs in such a manner that continues to keep their eyes on her. While she probably knows what some of your plan is by now, the rest of it is probably going to surprise her.\n\n\u201cMr. Zoll, this is Julie, my life partner of many years. Come over here and sit sweetie.\u201d You say taking a seat in a chair.\n\nJulie is indeed surprised by this, but quickly knows to play along. The two soldiers meanwhile can barely keep their mouths from hanging open. Mr. Zoll is better at keeping it together, but he\u2019s unsure of whether to stare at you or Julie and where!\n\n\u201cJulie. Don\u2019t sit all the way over there baby. Come over here.\u201d You say and pat you hands on your lap. Julie now has a bigger smile than anyone as she hops into your lap and puts her arms around you. You then give Julie a kiss on the lips; Julie however gets a bit overzealous by slipping you the tongue and grabbing one of your breasts.\n\n\u201cNow, now, honey, we have company.\u201d You say smiling and putting her hand back. \u201cI apologize Mr. Zoll, but we plan on finally getting officially married soon, now that it\u2019s become legal and we were sort of celebrating before you knocked on the door. We\u2019ve been friends and lovers for so long that its so liberating to long at last have the freedom to do what everyone else does. Did you know we came out to each other when we were sixteen? It was almost magical how we just knew it was so right in that high school shower room\u2026 \u201c\n\nNow Mr. Zoll crosses his legs because he\u2019s probably hiding a big boner. The soldiers at this point are unsubtly \u201crearranging\u201d but it looks more like they just want to whip it out and start whacking it. Zoll manages to get back on track.\n\n\u201cLadies, I really need to ask about this gunshot so let\u2019s get to it.\u201d\n\nYou and Julie say you heard a gunshot behind the house and not much else. Julie then mentions that she saw someone through the window jumping over the back fence, but couldn\u2019t make out what they looked like. Then she describes what they look like they were wearing from the back.\n\n\u201cAll I know is I was so scared that I hopped right back into bed and held on to my Suzy.\u201d Julie says and hugs you a little tighter.\n\u201cThere, there, it\u2019s over now. These big strong men are here to protect us from lawless scum like that.\u201d You say looking at Julie and rubbing her legs.\n\nYou turn back to Mr. Zoll.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s all we know Mr. Zoll. I hope it was helpful. As I said if you must search this house we understand, but I as a law abiding citizen of this country I do hope it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d You say to Mr. Zoll who looks like he\u2019s trying to scan you for deception.\n\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think that will be necessary. You two seem like a nice couple that just wants to live your lives and be free to do\u2026 whatever you want to each other in the privacy of your own home. Whoever is dumb enough to run around in this neighborhood firing off guns is bound to fuck up soon and we at least know a partial description now. Okay anyway, onto the second reason for my visit. Do you need anything? We\u2019re not just here to keep order, but to help out as well. While you\u2019re quite aware that you can\u2019t leave your home, we could bring some basic supplies like food to you. So anything?\u201d\n\nAny other time you might take them up on the offer, but right now you just want them gone.\n\n\u201cPerhaps another time. Nothing right now thanks.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell hopefully for all of us, this will all be over soon. Okay, I leave you two ladies.\u201d\n\nMr. Zoll tells his men that they\u2019re leaving (who seem very disappointed). A few more glances back at you and Julie and soon they\u2019re out the door. It\u2019s over and you\u2019re safe.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe we pulled that off.\u201d You say slumping a bit in your chair and breathing a sigh of relief.\n\u201cOh Suzy, that was fucking genius!\u201d Julie says who is still in your lap and hugging and kissing on your face.\n\u201cStop, it\u2019s over now, get off my lap. I still got a body to chop up and to dispose of.\u201d\n\nJulie ceases her affection and gets off your lap, though she looks a little hurt. Not wishing to cause more distress for her you apologize.\n\n\u201cLook, sorry. I just\u2026I still lost a sister and that\u2019s been going through my head since I found out today.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I understand. She was my friend. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even processed her death fully due to my own near death experience and the National Guard coming in here. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nJulie heads back upstairs and you return to your bathroom where Johnny\u2019s body still awaits your destruction.\n\nThe thing is now; you don\u2019t feel like it anymore. The rage and sadness are still there of course, but what is chopping his body up really going to do for you? Nothing except more work and you refuse to expend any more energy than you have to on this scum.\n\nYou get more trash bags and cover his upper half with one and his lower half with another. Then you duct tape them around him until he\u2019s wrapped pretty tightly.\n\nYou then wait until dark and head outside in the backyard with the shovel. Luckily Julie\u2019s fences are high enough that nobody is going to immediately see you. (It\u2019s a big yard anyway and the neighbors aren\u2019t very close either) The night is actually pretty quiet, though you do hear the occasional rumble of what sounds like trucks or some sort of military vehicles driving on the nearby roads.\n\nIt isn\u2019t exactly the easiest thing in the world digging in the ground at night, but luckily Julie\u2019s yard also has some pretty soft soil and it only takes most of the night as opposed to all of it. You then return back to retrieve Johnny\u2019s body and see Julie waiting nearby.\n\n\u201cYou could probably use the help in carrying this asshole right?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cIt would welcome.\u201d You say.\n\nThe pair of you lifts Johnny and carrying him outside and dump him into the hole you dug and then proceed to fill up. You and Julie then return inside the house.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s that.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cYep. And I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy?\u201d\n\u201cJulie, I know. Donna still needs to be taken care of. I just don\u2019t have any more energy today. I can\u2019t deal with it now, I\u2019m so drained it\u2019s taken all my energy not to just break down and cry.\u201d\n\u201cI know today has been rough for you and I wasn\u2019t talking about Donna. I just wanted to say I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you hadn\u2019t been here to take care of all this. You really went above and beyond today Suzy. I\u2019m never going to forget it.\u201d\n\nJulie says and goes to hug you and kisses you on the cheek. She then faintly smiles and walks away.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, and honestly you\u2019re too tired to sort out all the cocktail of emotions you\u2019ve been bombarded with lately, but right now you do know Julie doesn\u2019t really want to be alone.\n\n\u201cJulie, you don\u2019t need to got to you room, come on into my room.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d hate for the National Guard to suddenly show up and expose us as liars.\u201d You manage to joke which causes a bit of a smile from Julie.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep all you can think is \u201cHow can this week get any worse?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and find that Julie is still fast asleep with her head nestled against your body and one arm draped over you. The funny thing is this sort of thing doesn\u2019t even bother you anymore.\n\nBut your increasingly odd relationship with Julie isn\u2019t excessively important at this time. Right now you\u2019re dwelling more on the grim situation you\u2019re still in and the event less pleasant task you still have ahead of you. Not quite disturbing Julie yet, you reach over and grab your cell phone to check the time. Slept most of the day as usual. Just as well, since you won\u2019t have long to wait for nightfall again when you have to dig another hole out back.\n\n\u201cJulie, get up I have to go.\u201d You say tapping Julie on the head.\n\u201cHgm,.. no\u2026\u201d she utters.\n\u201cHave to, I\u2019ve got to take care of something and I think you know what it is.\u201d\n\nJulie slowly and reluctantly moves off of you and repositions herself on a pillow.\n\n\u201cI wish you could just stay in bed with me all day.\u201d She says.\n\u201cAt this point, I wish that too.\u201d You say and get up to leave to go get your sister out of the washer and dryer.\n\nYou grab your seemingly never-ending supply of garbage bags, cleaning products, some towels, a bucket of water, some rubber gloves and go down into the basement.\n\nOnce again approaching the washer and dryer you open up them up and are bombarded by a horrible smell. You end up coughing and hacking up again.\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026(pant) ugh\u2026goddamn it, I can get through this\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nYou empty the washing machine first, putting Donna\u2019s dismembered legs and arms in trash bags. You then dump some cleaning products into the washing machine and turn it on figuring that it will least wash most of the blood out.\n\nThe dryer on the other hand is not going to be as easy to clean. Johnny threw Donna\u2019s torso and head in there. While he didn\u2019t exactly eviscerate her, there are definitely some or her insides coming out. It\u2019s a horrible task (You try not to stare at her head for too long), but between the gagging you manage to get through it. Her body, her left over innards and her head all up into bags and tied up.\n\nYou then spend time trying to clean the dryer. Even with using bleach, you can\u2019t get rid of that horrible smell. You wonder if it\u2019ll ever go away.\n\n\u201cUgh, that\u2019s a really horrible smell.\u201d Julie says causing you to turn your head and see that she\u2019s come down to check on you.\n\u201cWhat are you doing down here? I told you I\u2019d take care of this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou were down here awhile and I decided to check on you. Besides, your brother Peter called.\u201d\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d\n\u201cYep, he was returning your call from yesterday. Didn\u2019t realize you called him.\u201d\n\u201cI was in the middle of calling him when that psycho attacked. Anyway, you talked to him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t tell him about what happened here, save for the National Guard coming in and telling us to stay indoors. I didn\u2019t want to tell him about Donna, I figured you\u2019d want to do that.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. Peter and Donna weren\u2019t exactly the closest either, but I think he\u2019d be pretty upset to hear about her death. So he didn\u2019t want to talk to me?\u201d\n\u201cWell I told him you were really busy cleaning up an awful mess elsewhere in the house. He actually said he didn\u2019t want to talk long though because he was worried that the government was monitoring the phone call what with the marshal law and all.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, sounds almost like something my brother Ben would\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the other thing. He mentioned he was busily trying to locate Ben\u2019s old hidden bunker in your backyard. He said he wants to wait this out in there because he\u2019s scared shitless and feels vulnerable just being stuck in your house by himself.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can see him being scared since this isn\u2019t the most relaxed of situations.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but he said its more than just the National Guard. He said he saw a few of your neighbors acting nuttier than a shithouse rat in the streets for no apparent reason. Like they were rabid animals. He mentioned some of them was trying to bite someone.\u201d\n\nYou stop cleaning for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhat? Crazy people trying to bite others? That almost sounds like something out of a horror movie. You sure he wasn\u2019t exaggerating?\u201d\n\u201cHe sure didn\u2019t sound like it, I mean it sort of makes sense. People have become more aggressive and hostile. The crime rate in this town has gone up so bad that the National Guard had to come in. I mean maybe everyone in town is going crazy from some sort of secret military experiment!\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then how come we aren\u2019t running around biting people?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell maybe it hasn\u2019t affected us yet, maybe we\u2019re immune, I don\u2019t know! Maybe it spreads by bite like in a zombie movie! I\u2019m just saying maybe we should start blocking the windows and doors.\u201d\n\u201cJulie its entirely possible Peter saw some people just high on bath salts! I mean the people who live in my neighborhood aren\u2019t exactly the most morally upstanding. Let\u2019s wait and see for a moment. I mean I\u2019m still cleaning up here, so it\u2019ll be awhile and\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly several machine gun shots are heard.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Julie says and instinctively ducks. You on the other hand get up off your knees from cleaning and start to head upstairs.\n\n\u201cAre you insane, where are you going?!\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cJulie, while at one time it would\u2019ve been unthinkable for me to head TOWARDS the sound of gunfire, I\u2019ve left a pistol and an axe upstairs. If nothing else I\u2019d like to retrieve to viable weapons if an impending zombie apocalypse is indeed coming.\u201d\n\u201cWell hold on I\u2019m coming with you, I don\u2019t want to be by myself!\u201d Julie says.\n\nAnd like that you\u2019re cautiously going upstairs towards potential danger with Julie touching one of your arms and hiding behind you. Now you really do feel like you\u2019re in a horror movie.\n\nWhen you get upstairs, you and Julie keep your heads down. The gunfire doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s immediately out in front of the house, but it\u2019s definitely nearby. You go and get the pistol first.\n\n\u201cWhy is the gun in the cereal box?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cBecause I was desperately trying to find a place to hide it yesterday. Julie, I think you better go put something a little more protective on. If we need to suddenly leave in a hurry you\u2019re not going to want to be running around in your underwear.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Where are you going to be?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going back to my room to retrieve the axe from the bathroom, wash this blood off and change my clothes as well since I obviously ruined these by cutting and ripping them yesterday in the first place.\u201d\n\nYou and Julie part ways briefly to go take care of your short-term goals. After washing up and changing your clothes again you start to ponder what your next move might be. You don\u2019t quite get to do that since once again you\u2019re interrupted by the breaking of glass coming from the kitchen followed by snarling and grunting.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you exclaim and run to the kitchen to see a bloody arm through the window of the backdoor attempting to unlock it. The thing on the other side gets more excited when it sees you and starts pounding the glass with its other hand cracking more of it. It seems completely oblivious to the fact that it\u2019s severely cutting itself in the process.\n\nIt looks like a regular (if a bit wild) human. It doesn\u2019t look rotten (Could be fresh though) and maybe it isn\u2019t a zombie, but you know damn well you can\u2019t let it get in! You shoot at it through the glass completely shattering the rest of the window. The bullet hits it in the face and the thing falls backwards making one last death growl.\n\nYou cautiously move to look through the broken window and see that you\u2019ve killed it. Meanwhile Julie has come running to see if you\u2019re okay.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Oh thank god! Are you okay?!\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cYeah, but I apologize for doubting you and Peter. One of those\u2026 things, guess I\u2019ll call them the rabid just attacked. Look what one did to this door, I\u2019d hate to think what more of them might do in a group.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh shit! We need to start blocking the doors and windows!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if we shouldn\u2019t just get the hell out of here while we can.\u201d\n\u201cI really think we we\u2019d be safer if we stayed put! I mean we have more than enough furniture and items to barricade ourselves in here. If we leave, we run the risk of bumping into hordes of them and that\u2019s not counting the military who are still shooting people on sight, maybe even more so now. Where would we go anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI admit, I haven\u2019t figured that part out yet, but I think you\u2019re hoping to ride this thing out until shit gets back to normal and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s even going to happen. We aren\u2019t exactly well supplied here for a long-term stay even if we do barricade this place. Now I\u2019ll give you that it\u2019s probably going to be dangerous out there, but at least we\u2019ll have more freedom to move around.\u201d\n\nJulie of course will follow you no matter what you decide, but she really wants to stay in. As much as you think it might be better to leave now, you probably would be safe if you barricaded yourselves in the house properly. Things do sound hectic out there right now with all the gunfire, it might even be best if you waited until things died down a bit and sneak out later.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave now", "result": "Things aren\u2019t going to \u201ccalm down\u201d, they\u2019re just going to get worse if anything. You\u2019ve already had too many intruders inside this house, staying here obviously isn\u2019t safe even if you do barricade it. You need to get out now.\n\n\u201cJulie get some bags and start packing items like flashlights and the like because we\u2019re getting the hell out of here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut again, where are we going to go?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cAnd I still don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m thinking we need to at least get out of this town though. From there I guess we\u2019ll play it by ear. Your car is still at the shop so we\u2019re going to have to use Donna\u2019s. Do you know if Donna had a spare set of car keys? When I had to\u2026clean up, it wasn\u2019t like she was clothed at the time so there wasn\u2019t anything on her.\u201d\n\u201cShe probably left her keys on a dresser in her room when she first stormed in the house on Monday. I\u2019ll check. Speaking of Donna, what are you going to do about her? I mean you were going to bury her, but now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sort of wishing I\u2019d buried her first instead of the asshole that killed her now. I dunno, I mean there just isn\u2019t time. (Sigh) Fuck it, she\u2019s just an empty shell now, the person that she was is gone and we need to make haste if we don\u2019t want to end up like her, so let\u2019s start getting a move on.\u201d\n\nJulie and you both split up to pack your bags. One of your bags that you brought hasn\u2019t even been opened and is still full of clothing. You fill your other bags with more useful items like some of the non-perishable snack food Julie has, the duct tape you were using, a few of the bigger kitchen knives, loose batteries, some of the medicine in the bathroom, etc.\n\nYou then finish up with packing a few more of your personal items and are ready to go.\n\n\u201cJulie, are you ready yet and did you find the keys?!\u201d you call up to her.\n\u201cYeah, yeah I\u2019m just making sure I got everything!\u201d she calls back.\n\nYou hear more gunfire coming from outside which sounds like its right outside the front door. A quick look out the window and you do see several guardsmen firing on those crazy people running at them. It looks like the National Guard have set up a bit of a \u201cbase\u201d in one of the houses further up the street. You just hope you can drive off without too much problem. You\u2019re going to have to be quick that\u2019s for sure.\n\nJulie comes running down the stairs with two bags and a big luggage case.\n\n\u201cJulie, what the hell, I told you to just focus on the essentials!\u201d\n\u201cI did! I need all this\u2026shit!\u201d Julie says and trips down the stairs due to all the stuff she\u2019s trying to lug around and going at a fast pace. You attempt to keep her from breaking her neck by getting in the way of her fall. You\u2019re partially successful though getting crushed by a tumbling body and heavy bags isn\u2019t fun.\n\n\u201cFuck\u2026shit\u2026goddamn\u2026\u201d you utter as you feel the pain. Surprisingly Julie doesn\u2019t seem any worse for wear.\n\u201cWow. That was lucky. Thanks Suzy.\u201d She says in a bit of an animated tone. You look at her eyes and see that her pupils dilated.\n\u201cJulie are you fucking high right now?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit Julie, really?\u201d\n\u201cI needed a little to take the edge off! I mean I\u2019ve been practically sober for the past few days and I needed something to keep myself from breaking down completely! I\u2019ve already proven I\u2019m no good in these high stress situations and now we\u2019re going to enter a whole new level of fucked upness by leaving this house! I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not as strong as you!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really have time to argue with Julie about this right now, but she might have a point. If drugs are going to keep her from melting down into a quivering mess then maybe it is for the best that she\u2019s a little high. The funny thing is before all this happened you were the one that was a bit more of a worrywart and Julie tended to have a more laid back approach to life. Just goes to show how one can never tell how people will react in an emergency situation.\n\n\u201cAlright fine, but we\u2019re going to deal with this later and where are the car keys? I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let you drive in your condition.\u201d\n\nGrabbing the keys from Julie, you pick yourself up and grab your own bags and cautiously open the front door.\n\n\u201cAlright we need to throw these bags in the back of car as quick as possible and then drive off equally as fast. These weekend warriors are patrolling all over this neighborhood and who knows where those rabid things are.\u201d\n\nYou and Julie run over to the car and open up the doors and start throwing in your bags. Takes a moment for Julie to shove in her big luggage case, but she gets it in. The pair of you then get in the front seats of the car and you start up the car.\n\nYou actually manage to swing the car out into the street before you hear shouting and then fired upon. Julie screams as the sounds of glass shatter behind you from the bullets. You keep it together and just drive hoping that there aren\u2019t too many of the guard in front of you.\n\nIt\u2019s a false hope as you do indeed bump into more than a couple patrols with itchy trigger fingers. Some you try to avoid by going down other streets. Others are actually busy fighting off others. How you and Julie aren\u2019t hit by any that do shoot at you is something of a minor miracle, but the car certainly doesn\u2019t come through unscathed since by the time you manage to make out of Julie\u2019s neighborhood, it\u2019s making rattling sounds.\n\n\u201cOh god! I knew we shouldn\u2019t have left! The car\u2019s gonna die and then so will we!\u201d Julie shouts.\n\u201cJulie take some more of your happy pills or calm the fuck down, I\u2019m trying to think! Shit! There\u2019s some of those things!\u201d you say as you smash the car into two insane looking individuals that just jumped out of nowhere. One goes flying off to the side and the other falls backwards in front of your car, which then promptly runs over him entirely.\n\nYou continue to drive and try to keep off the main streets though with your car now making several clattering sounds you\u2019re not exactly keeping a low profile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to make it out of this town! Not with the car in this condition! We need to go back!\u201d Julie exclaims.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back now Julie! I told you to take some more of\u2026 whatever it is you take and let me try to fucking think!\u201d you say while trying to keep an eye on your immediate surroundings.\n\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re currently not too far from my house. I suppose we could go there and try to help Peter look for my brother\u2019s shelter and hold up in there. At the very least we could exchange cars there. I\u2019m sure Peter isn\u2019t going to have any intention on using his.\n\nJulie doesn\u2019t really answer you, she\u2019s too busy digging in her pockets for pills. You decide to just go ahead and head to your house.\n\nYour drive there isn\u2019t quite as eventful as your escape from Julie\u2019s house, but it isn\u2019t without peril. The National Guard isn\u2019t quite as in control in your part of the town and there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses. Most of them don\u2019t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don\u2019t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn\u2019t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but instead your only major concern is herding Julie\u2019s high ass to the front door and getting inside with all the bags you\u2019re both carrying.\n\n\u201cPETER?! Are you here?!\u201d you call out when you get in the door since you saw his vehicle in the driveway. There is no answer though. You dump all your bags on the floor while Julie practically just collapses on the floor with her bags.\n\nYou help her up and lay her down on the sofa and see that she\u2019s feeling quite numb now, though she still tries to grip on to you when you pull away.\n\n\u201cSuzy, don\u2019t leave me\u2026please\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJulie, I have to see if Peter\u2019s in the house or if it\u2019s just us. I won\u2019t be that far away.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy\u2026I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so fucked up\u2026I don\u2019t know what\u2026I would\u2019ve done if you weren\u2019t around\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJulie, just rest right now.\u201d\n\nWith this last bit of reassurance Julie faintly smiles and closes her eyes.\n\nThe first thing you do is search the ground floor. Amazingly it doesn\u2019t look like your house has been attacked at all. Even looking out into the backyard things look fairly untouched.\n\nThen you search the connected garage and that\u2019s when you wish you hadn\u2019t.\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn\u2019t the disturbing part. The fact that they\u2019re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\nThe garage itself is a bit of a mess, like there was definitely a struggle, and your brother\u2019s body and the body of who you presume is his lover or client both show signs of blunt trauma. Looks like their necks were both broken to ultimately kill them though.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what to think. You feel like you should be more upset than you are, but given what you\u2019ve already experienced you\u2019ve become desensitized. You\u2019re actually more concerned with how this happened. There isn\u2019t anyone else here to your knowledge and if it had been one of those things, the bodies would probably have bite marks. You suppose it could\u2019ve been regular bandits or robbers, but you\u2019d expect gunshot or even knife wounds and neither have that.\n\nAlso if it was bandits that killed them, you wonder why they wouldn\u2019t take Peter\u2019s car since his keys are still sitting on a dresser nearby. Whether Peter was planning on leaving himself or still looking for Ben\u2019s hidden shelter (And if he found it or not) you\u2019ll never know you suppose.\n\nIn any event you have the means to leave immediately if you so desire which given the uneasiness of this situation might not be a bad idea, but then again it\u2019s starting to get dark so it still might be best to bunk here for the night at least.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave in Peter\u2019s car", "result": "After pondering it several times over, you think it would be best to just get the hell out of this town. You\u2019re not wasting your time looking for Ben\u2019s hidden shelter, and after finding your brother\u2019s body in here, you don\u2019t think this would be a safe place to stay the night.\n\n\u201cJulie, come on get up, we\u2019re not staying here.\u201d You say jostling her.\n\u201cMgh, can\u2019t we just rest here? I\u2019m so tired and it\u2019s safe here.\u201d She says.\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t, I just found my dead brother in the fucking garage along with his boyfriend or whoever that guy is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, seriously?\u201d Julie says waking up a bit.\n\u201cYeah, so let\u2019s get the hell out of here! Come on, grab your bags.\u201d\n\nWith some effort, Julie rouses herself from her drug induced exhaustion and grabs her bags. You get your own and make your way to Peter\u2019s car.\n\nAfter loading it up as quickly as possible, Julie slumps into the passenger seat and you get into the driver\u2019s seat and start it up. So far nothing has come running to attack you, but certainly don\u2019t want to stick around for it happen.\n\nYou make your way towards what you believe is going to be the quickest way out of town, but instead you come across more National Guard barricades. Naturally they tell you to stop, but you don\u2019t and once again you\u2019re making U-Turns under a hail of fire.\n\n\u201cHoly shit Julie! We just got out of being shot at once before, do we really have to do this again?! Can\u2019t we just go back\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJULIE SHUT THE FUCK UP I\u2019M TRYING TO GET US THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!\u201d you scream and serve down a side street. Julie of course starts crying.\n\nYou\u2019re so harried and frustrated that you barely even know where you are. This town might not be the largest, but it seems like a maze when you barely leave the house for years.\n\nYou drive into an area that is literally swarming with the rabid. From the abandoned military vehicles it looks like the National Guard lost its battle here. A crowd of rabid see and hear your car and start immediately running towards you.\n\n\u201cJulie we can\u2019t run them all over! The car will overturn! Turn back! Turn back!\u201d Julie screams, but you don\u2019t listen.\n\nYou slam the gas pedal and go full speed ahead.\n\nYou run over several of them and then their bodies begin to get stuck in the wheels causing the car to skid and spin. You attempt to maintain control, but you fail to do so and the car flips over lands against the wall of a building upside down.\n\nYou\u2019re hurt, but since you had your seatbelt on, you\u2019re still able to move, but unfortunately, you can\u2019t open the door on your side because it\u2019s crushed against a wall.\n\nYou look over to Julie and she\u2019s not moving. In fact she\u2019s half way through the windshield. She\u2019s obviously dead, but that isn\u2019t what concerns you at the moment. What concerns you is the rest of the rabid running over to the car.\n\nAfter a few moments of struggling, the rabid eventually pull you out of the car and sink their teeth into you and gnaw straight through your bones. You die screaming as they eat you alive.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay", "result": "Chances are, you\u2019d not only have drag Julie\u2019s ass to Peter\u2019s car, but you\u2019d also have to load up all the bags yourself as well. Since you don\u2019t particularly want to spend much time outside at night, you figure you\u2019ll stay here, rest and figure out exactly what you\u2019re going to do tomorrow.\n\nBesides if you still want to leave, you\u2019ll have time to pack more supplies you can get from here too.\n\nIn the meantime, you still have to search the rest of the house because it\u2019s still entirely possible that it isn\u2019t safe here.\n\nYou exit the garage and check on Julie again. She\u2019s not quite asleep yet, but is heading in that direction. Fortunately you don\u2019t have as many windows in this house and your doors are a lot stronger so you\u2019re confident that if something tries to break in, you\u2019ll hear it and be able to react in time.\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with your pistol drawn. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn\u2019t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly\u2019s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever returned here. You get the idea to call her up, but predictably there isn\u2019t any answer. Who knows what\u2019s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn\u2019t anyone down here either. Your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\nStill, there is a part of you that realizes that it\u2019s probably best that you did break your habit of hiding out in the basement. Chances are you wouldn\u2019t have developed the courage to do some of the things you are able to do now. You also saved Julie\u2019s life and while she\u2019s certainly been needy and a bit of a wreck during all this, you\u2019re a little glad you don\u2019t have to go through this crisis entirely by yourself.\n\nAfter a bit more perusal of your room, you head back upstairs to secure the ground floor as much as possible. Still not risking turning the lights on, you put chairs in front of the front and back doors. (As well as the one leading to the garage)\n\nYou also move a bookcase in front of some of the windows. It\u2019s not the most fun thing to do in the dark and you bump and bang knees and elbows in the process, but it\u2019s secure enough that you\u2019re confident that if someone does try to get it, they\u2019ll make such a loud noise in the process that you\u2019ll at least wake up first.\n\n\u201cSuzy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d you hear Julie ask in a sleepy tone. You figured she\u2019d be fast asleep by now.\n\u201cNothing, just securing the area. Nothing for you to worry about, go to sleep.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to, but I want you with me on this sofa.\n\u201cJulie\u2026(sigh). Look I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s room for both of us to stretch out on that sofa. I\u2019ll be right here you know. I\u2019ll be in the recliner.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll move over as far as I can, and you can squeeze in next to me. Please, I just want your body next to mine. You make me feel so safe.\u201d Julie says.\n\nYou put your hand to your head and start to wonder why you\u2019re becoming more comfortable in even entertaining ideas like this especially with all that\u2019s going on right now.\n\nThough maybe that\u2019s the reason. This is the end of the goddamn world for all you know and at this point you\u2019ve lost everyone that\u2019s been remotely close to you. All of your family is dead (or in Kelly\u2019s case missing). Your boyfriend is also gone. They were all dysfunctional, but it\u2019s what you knew and you still miss it.\n\nSo maybe even as dysfunctional as Julie is, you still feel that need for her companionship because it\u2019s familiar. You have no one else close to you except Julie and she\u2019s going to be \u201cit\u201d if the dark future is any indication.\n\n\u201cOkay, Julie, scoot over.\u201d You say placing your pistol on the table in front of the sofa and start to squeeze in on the edge of it.\n\nThere actually is enough room, it\u2019s snug, but you aren\u2019t quite in danger of falling off the edge. Julie puts one arm and leg over your body almost in an attempt to make sure you don\u2019t fall off, but it\u2019s just her being affectionate as usual.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026\u201d she says and she starts to drift off.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you say still trying to get comfortable.\n\u201cI love you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know Julie. I know.\u201d You answer in a non-committal way.\n\nYou sort of wonder exactly when she began to feel that way. Adulthood? High school? Middle School? Whenever it was, you guess it makes sense since even when you were little you were helping her out of trouble when you could. You probably were the one constant in her life that was genuinely a friend and also not looking to fuck her.\n\nYou still haven\u2019t quite sorted out all your \u201cfeelings\u201d yet on this, but you do realize that if you didn\u2019t care somewhat about Julie, you wouldn\u2019t have been making the effort to save her as much as you have.\n\nYou guess at least someone is appreciating you and that\u2019s definitely been a rarity in your life.\n\nYou\u2019re up for a little while longer so you just lie there in the dark going over in your head some of your possible choices of what to do tomorrow. The more you think about it, the more you think that probably leaving is the best solution. You\u2019ll gather some more items from here and load up Peter\u2019s car and tomorrow you and Julie will be heading somewhere else. You still aren\u2019t entirely sure where though.\n\nYou eventually do get sleepy and slowly drift off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201cI got your call. Wakey wakey sis.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it\u2019s your sister Kelly.\n\nUnfortunately it looks like not all your family is dead after all and of course it had to be Kelly that survived. Judging by the fact she\u2019s pointing a shotgun at you she\u2019s still hostile as well. You don\u2019t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at the pistol on the table and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you wouldn\u2019t make it sis. I suggest you don\u2019t even try\u2026heh I doubt you\u2019d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d\n\nAt this point Julie wakes up.\n\n\u201cSuzy what\u2019s going\u2026oh my god\u2026\u201d she says upon seeing Kelly.\n\u201cShhh, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d You say trying to reassure Julie.\n\u201cSo when did you turn dyke Suzy? Always sort of figured you might be down for the rug munching. Guess that\u2019s why things didn\u2019t work out with Bobby eh? Still though, Julie? I have to say even I think you could do better than some used up party whore. Now the pair of you lesbos sit up.\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Julie move and shift on the couch until you\u2019re both sitting upright. In the meantime Kelly grabs your pistol from the table and places it in the front of her pants. She continues to focus the shotgun on you.\n\nGiven that you barricaded all the doors and searched the entire house last night you wonder how the hell Kelly got in. If she had been lurking inside, she definitely would\u2019ve made her presence known and ambushed you yesterday and if she broke in, you definitely would\u2019ve heard something before now.\n\nYou\u2019re also a little concerned not just because Kelly\u2019s pointing a shotgun at you, but you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man\u2019s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly\u2019s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one\u2026\n\n\u201cKelly, our siblings Peter and Donna are dead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cPeter\u2019s dead?\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cOh? Didn\u2019t know that about Donna. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll shed any tears. The spoiled little whore wasn\u2019t much better than your girlfriend here.\u201d\n\u201cShe was fucking chopped up by a goddamn serial killer, you bitch!\u201d Julie exclaims.\n\u201cHm, interesting. So how did you two survive?\u201d\n\u201cI shot him.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s a little taken back.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m impressed. Guess you would have the balls to use this pistol then. Tell me, was that the only person you killed this week little sister?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 I shot one of those rabid people too. Ran over a couple as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, well aren\u2019t you the bad ass now? Heh. Funny what an extreme situation like this can do to folks isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026so I\u2019m guessing if you know about Peter, you\u2019ve probably figured out by now what happened or at least have a strong suspicion. You\u2019re a lot of things Suzy, but I\u2019d never call you an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that. So why\u2019d you do it?\u201d\n\nKelly chuckles a bit before answering.\n\n\u201cThat little faggot found out where Ben\u2019s old shelter was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn\u2019t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.\u201d\n\u201cSo you know where Ben\u2019s old shelter is then.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah. I\u2019ve always known where it was. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I\u2019m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would\u2019ve been sleeping in the damn thing.\u201d\n\nWell that explains how Kelly got in without alerting you. Still, if she\u2019s actually admitting the entrance to the shelter is somewhere in the basement and what she did to Peter, then that pretty much confirms she has no intention of sharing.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s next Kelly? You gonna kill us too?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know sis\u2026don\u2019t know\u2026severely thinking about it. I\u2019ve never like you. You\u2019ve been a thorn in my side since you crawled out of mom\u2019s vagina. Always having to be compared to how good and pretty you were and how bad and rotten I was despite the fact I was the one who was shouldering most of the responsibility in this fucked up family. What did you ever do except hide in the goddamn basement? Even now you left the house only to come crawling back here. Yep, I\u2019ve thought about killing you on many, many, MANY occasions.\u201d\n\u201cActually that wasn\u2019t my initial intention. My initial plan was to drive out of this forsaken town. I only stopped here because our own car was badly damaged and I had hoped to maybe get Peter\u2019s car and some extra supplies before heading out again.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Hmm, you\u2019re just full of surprises today aren\u2019t you? Well if that is true, you may have just bought yourself a bit of a reprieve sis\u2026okay. What the hell, I\u2019m in a good mood. I\u2019m gonna let you and your whore walk outta here alive and you\u2019re going to be thankful.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll allow us to gather our bags or give me the gun back will you?\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, no I don\u2019t think so. Wouldn\u2019t want you getting any ideas of attempting to come back here. Leave with what you got on you or die, those are your choices sis. I\u2019m being very generous here. Take my offer.\u201d\n\nYou stare at Kelly, but it\u2019s not with fear. It\u2019s with anger. Anger at all the past abuse you\u2019ve had to endure from her. While she may have a minor point that you were the favorite and she did a lot for the family, she still had no right to bully and torment you for the majority of your life and she certainly had no right to murder Peter.\n\n\u201cCome on Suzy, let\u2019s go\u2026\u201d Julie says wanting for the both of you to be out of danger.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave now", "result": "As angry as you are, making some foolish attempt to stand up to Kelly while she\u2019s holding all the advantages is not going to help anyone.

You got all the advantages and you win.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDamn straight I win.\u201d Kelly snorts.\n\nJulie removes the barricades the front door and cautiously looks around.\n\n\u201cCome on, come on, if any of those crazy fuckers were out there, they would\u2019ve been beating down the doors and windows by now.\u201d Kelly says motioning the pair of you to leave quicker.\n\nJulie exits and when you step up to the entryway, Kelly speaks up.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you answer turning around.\n\u201cChanged my mind. I fucking hate you too much.\u201d\n\nAnd with those words Kelly blasts you in the chest with the shotgun.

I can hardly believe you\u2019re the same Suzy that spent hiding from the rest of the world. Guess you\u2019ve finally learned to stand up and be a woman.\u201d Kelly says with a smirk.\n\n\u201cBut so what? You think because you\u2019ve survived some of the horrors out there, you think standing up to me is going to suddenly change the situation? Got news for ya, it ain\u2019t. I can blow your fucking head off with one twitch of my finger. Last chance to get the fuck out of my house!\u201d Kelly adds.\n\u201cFuck you Kelly. I know you. You already made up your mind to kill me as soon as I woke up. I turn my back and you\u2019ll probably shoot me for the hell of it as I walk out the door.\u201d\n\nKelly starts laughing.\n\n\u201cWell like I said, you always were a smart one. Too bad you did something incredibly stupid by walking in here in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cKelly, please! Just let us go! We won\u2019t come back! We\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d Julie starts to plead\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP YOU DUMB BITCH OR YOU\u2019LL BE FIRST!\u201d Kelly shouts before turning her attention back to you.\n\nJulie at this point starts sobbing uncontrollably. You continue to stare down the barrel of the shotgun like you\u2019re fearless, but that isn\u2019t true at all and Kelly knows it.\n\n\u201cYou can give me the hard looks all you want, but deep down I know you\u2019re ready to shit your panties. Which I imagine you\u2019ll do after you\u2019re dead anyway. You ready to die little sister?\u201d\n\u201cSure, just a little surprised you\u2019d choose this method. Guess you\u2019re more intimidated by me than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kelly snorts.\n\u201cYou\u2019re intimidated by me. You always have been. I really should\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy. I\u2019ve never been intimidated by you.\u201d\n\u201cSure you have, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve bullied me all these years. You\u2019ve said yourself on many occasions on how pretty I am so I know you\u2019re jealous of my looks. You\u2019ve just admitted that I\u2019m smart. The only thing that I always lacked in was self-confidence and now that I have that, well I\u2019m pretty much better than you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck you Suzy!\u201d Kelly says.\n\u201cNo, I get it, you want to play it safe and shoot me, because hey if I gained self-confidence, who knows I might just be able to kick your ass in a fair fight.\u201d\n\u201cHah, not fuckin\u2019 likely\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll never know, because you\u2019ll shoot me and Julie and then go down and hide in the fucking basement\u2026well what do you know\u2026we\u2019re more alike than you thought. Imagine that.\u201d\n\nAnd with that taunt it\u2019s the last straw. Kelly flies into a rage. It\u2019s the kind of rage she flies into when she\u2019s participating in her underground fight club. She abandons all rational thought, drops the shotgun to the side and lunges at you with both of her hands going straight for your neck.\n\nJulie is knocked to one side and you fall backward on the couch. You attempt to roll and scramble to escape, but Kelly grabs you by the hair.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, beating your scrawny ass to death WILL be more enjoyable.\u201d Kelly exclaims.\n\u201cJulie, grab the shotgun!\u201d you manage to shout before Kelly throws you face first into the bookcase. Kelly then stops Julie from scrambling on the floor for the shotgun by kicking her in the side and then stomping on her back.\n\nStill struggling to recover you grab some of the heavier books that have fallen near you and start throwing them at Kelly. A couple hit her in the head and she ceases abusing Julie and returns to attack you.\n\nYou manage to throw one more book at her face, but it doesn\u2019t even slow her down. She punches you in the stomach causing you to collapse as you feel the air leave all your body and feel like you can\u2019t breathe. As you wheeze, Kelly leans down and grabs the back of your neck with one of her hands. It feels like a fucking vice.\n\n\u201cA hit to the gut, fucks you all up doesn\u2019t it? Feels like you\u2019re suffocating, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t do much of anything really. It\u2019s how Houdini died you know. I\u2019m gonna hurt you so badly Suzy, you don\u2019t even know\u2026but you soon will.\u201d\n\nKelly with her other hand smashes a fist into the side of your face. You feel your eye almost close immediately as the rest of you hits the floor. If you could catch your breath, you probably would\u2019ve cried out from the pain though you\u2019re a little dizzy more than anything right now.\n\n\u201cThought you could kick my ass. Bitch please, what the fuck were you thinking? This isn\u2019t a goddamn comic book or movie\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s body lands on top of yours with crushing weight. You then hear a shotgun blast and some debris of the bookcase consisting of paper and cheap wood fall on you and Kelly.\n\n\u201cLEAVE HER ALONE YOU FUCKING CUNT!\u201d you hear Julie scream.\n\nYou still aren\u2019t in any condition to do anything, but Kelly certainly is. She scrambles for the pistol still in the front of her pants and gets up while yanking you up with one hand to use you as a human shield.\n\nJulie takes cover around a corner when Kelly starts shooting. Four shots are fired before clicking follows.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Kelly exclaims and drops the pistol.\n\nYou\u2019re practically deaf from the proximity of a pistol going off near your head along with being disorientated. Kelly positions herself behind the couch to give herself some extra cover. She also tightens her grip around your neck with her forearm and puts her other hand on your head ready to break your neck in a second if need be.\n\nJulie comes back out from around the corner weeping, but unsteadily pointing the shotgun at Kelly.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026Suzy\u2026(Sob) Let her go!\u201d\n\n\u201cJulie, you\u2019re not in any position to give orders. Now granted with a shotgun and you don\u2019t need perfect aim at this range, but your precious girlfriend here is BOUND to get hit in the process. Never mind the fact I could break her neck before you get the courage to pull the trigger anyway.\u201d\n\u201cLET HER GO!\u201d Julie screams again.\n\u201cNot gonna happen whore. You got two choices. You try to do the impossible by trying to hit me or you walk out the door and go on with your life. Either way one thing is certain, Suzy here isn\u2019t going anywhere. Her fate is sealed and there isn\u2019t anything you can do about it. Think about it Julie. Do you really want to be the one that kills her? Just walk away now taking solace in the fact that you never had a choice.\u201d Kelly says.\n\nEven with one blurring eye open right now, you can see Julie just standing there sobbing and looking so helpless, despite wielding a shotgun.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 (sob)\u201d Julie cries.\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re going to pass out with Kelly\u2019s big meaty arm wrapped around your neck right now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell Julie to take the shot", "result": "At this point you\u2019ve come close to death so many times that you\u2019re not scared of dying anymore.

She\u2019s scared of a lot of things and if this week is any indication of how shitty the world is going to become, well she\u2019s not going to last very long in it.\n\nIf she walks out that door without even the supplies you came in with, it\u2019ll be like killing her and you can\u2019t let that happen. It is a sad thing that in this late stage you realize you do have feelings for Julie, and it\u2019ll be even sadder for her when she loses you, but hopefully it\u2019ll make her a bit tougher in the long run.\n\n\u201cJulie, take the shot.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWha\u2026what?!\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cNice, bluff sis, but it\u2019s not gonna save your ass.\u201d Kelly snorts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fucking bluff, you roid rage bitch.

I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Julie cries.\n\u201cI\u2019m already dead Julie. Just take the shot.

Julie continues to struggle with the morality of all this.\n\n\u201cJULIE TAKE THE FUCKING SHOT!\u201d you manage to shout despite Kelly crushing your throat.\n\nAnd those are the last words you utter as the sound of a shotgun blast follows.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Tell Julie to leave", "result": "\u201cJulie, go\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cSuzy!

FUCK!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re successful and the piece of metal sinks deep into the orb.\n\nKelly releases her grip just enough for you to slip from her clutches and drop to the floor.\n\n\u201cSHOOT HER NOW!\u201d you yell.\n\nYou see Julie pull the shotgun back up to her shoulder and point it at Kelly. A loud booming noise fills the room when she fires followed by a sickening squishy sound. Blood splatters on you from over head and the slumping of a body falls partially on you.\n\nJulie drops the shotgun and rushes over to help you up.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Oh my god, I was so\u2026\u201d Julie starts to say in between the sobbing.\n\u201cJulie, don\u2019t fuss right now, I\u2019m fine. But right now the pair of us need to get our asses into the basement and look for that shelter entrance. With all the gunfire that went off in here, I\u2019d hate to think what kind of crowd we may have attracted.\u201d\n\nJulie helps you up, but in reality, she\u2019s hurting just as much as you, so you basically prop each other up. You stumble down into the basement and fortunately you don\u2019t even need to search. You see a hatch in the floor that you\u2019ve never seen before wide open and a fluorescent glow of lighting coming from within it. Apparently Kelly didn\u2019t even bother to close up the hidden door.\n\nYou take a look inside and see a long ladder down leading to another floor, which you imagine that\u2019s the main shelter. You can\u2019t believe how close it was to your room and how you never knew about it!\n\n\u201cHow the hell did you brother do this with you hearing or knowing about it?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cI dunno. I mean he managed to routinely change the entrance all the damn time too. Ben had a gift I guess.\u201d you say and you and Julie start climbing down the ladder and you close up the hatch.\n\nEventually you get to the bottom and you and Julie open up a metal door, which is fortunately not locked.\n\nAnd there it is, you\u2019re in the shelter proper. Before you is a dimly lit living area with various furniture and even a TV. Other rooms include a bathroom, kitchen area, a couple of bedrooms and A LOT of storage rooms. One such room is huge, as rows and rows of canned food and bottled water are found.\n\n\u201cWell looks like we\u2019ll be fine for sustenance for awhile. Doesn\u2019t even look like Kelly put a dent in the supplies.\u201d You say.\n\nAnother storage room contains a goodly amount of ammo and weapons of all kinds. Mostly rifles. Medical supplies are in another.\n\nOne thing that stands out is that Ben\u2019s shelter has solid steel walls. You have no idea how the hell he did this and you guess you never will. You do notice on several of the walls something has been repeatedly scratched out though not entirely successfully everywhere.\n\nAt one point you make out most of it.\n\nPr-p---- o- th- Gr--n- -er- Cor---at-o-\n\n\u201cWell Julie, guess we didn\u2019t have to spend a bunch of money like those fucking commercials always said.

Guess I\u2019m not very pretty right now.\u201d You laugh.\n\nJulie holds your hand and looks into your one good eye.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be pretty to me.\u201d She says and strokes your hair with her other hand.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence between the pair of you.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026 when Kelly was holding you hostage, I know you said what you said to trick her into letting down her guard, but\u2026 was it really true? I mean it\u2019s fine but I just\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t answer her, you instead just grab the back of her head with your other hand and bring her lips directly to your own and kiss her passionately. And this time this isn\u2019t one of those fake kisses to trick the National Guard; you genuinely mean it, because you do have deep feelings for Julie.\n\nWhen you and Julie stop kissing, her eyes are closed and she exhales like a wave of euphoria has just washed over her.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess that answers my question.\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cOw. Ow. Get up, get up.\u201d You say feeling another wave of pain exacerbated by the fact that Julie is partially on top of you right now.\n\u201cOh. Sorry! Sorry! You okay?\u201d Julie says getting off of you.\n\u201cYeah, just still really hurt.\u201d You groan.\n\u201cYeah so am I actually. Why don\u2019t I try to go find a compress or something for your eye?\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Maybe bring back some painkillers while you\u2019re at it. I\u2019ll just lay here and hurt.\u201d\n\nJulie leaves and you\u2019re left in the room alone. You mainly just lie there, but you do occasionally have the brief thoughts of just how fucked up this week has been. At least you\u2019ve sorted out your feelings for Julie though. Despite the pain, you\u2019re also tired. Really you haven\u2019t even been up that long today in the scheme of things, but being held hostage and getting the shit kicked out of you is enough for you to want to go back to sleep.\n\nBesides, it isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve got anything else to do immediately. You\u2019re safe down here and you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what to do next after some rest.\n\nYou drift off\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to total silence for once.

She\u2019s right next to you on the bed as you sort of figured she would be when you woke up.\n\nYou instinctively reach for your cell phone to check the time, but you don\u2019t currently have it on you. Fortunately there is a large clock on the wall in the room that you\u2019re guessing is accurate.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, why the hell am I up this early?\u201d you say to yourself, but then you remember you fell asleep pretty early yesterday. Really you\u2019re sort of surprised you didn\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nYou get up and you\u2019re still hurting, but you\u2019re compelled to go wash yourself since your clothes are caked with dried blood at this point and you\u2019ve been wearing them for a couple days.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to go test the shower, Julie stirs from her sleep.\n\n\u201cSuzy, what\u2019re doing? You shouldn\u2019t be up and around.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m stinking like a dog here, I need to wash up.\u201d\n\u201cYou smell fine, I like the way you stink.\u201d Julie says.\n\nYou start laughing.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you do, but I really feel like I should\u2026 (Sigh) shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t have a change of clothes. We got just about everything in this thing except clothing.\u201d\n\u201cSo? You don\u2019t need clothing, just go all natural, it\u2019s just us after all. I\u2019ll even join you.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, while I\u2019m sure that kiss from yesterday has got you all revved up, we still need to talk about us in more detail before we start taking it to that level. In the meantime I guess I\u2019m going to have go upstairs to get some clean clothes.\u201d\n\u201cWait, are you serious?! Those things could be up there!\u201d Julie exclaims.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be taking some weapons with me.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re wounded! You really shouldn\u2019t be going out there!\u201d\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true I ache, I can at least see out both eyes clearly again. Surprisingly I\u2019m feeling slightly energetic. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\u201cOh Suzy, (Sigh) I can\u2019t let you go by yourself! I\u2019ll come with you!\u201d\n\nYou and Julie grab a couple of the lighter assault rifles and some ammo and head up the ladder. Really the most nerve-racking part is going to be the initial opening of the hatch since anything could be lurking around ready to attack as soon as you pop your head up.\n\nYou open up the hatch and scramble to the basement floor, looking around in all directions.\n\n\u201cSuzy? Is it safe?\u201d Julie whispers from the ladder.\n\u201cWell if it wasn\u2019t I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve attacked by now. I don\u2019t even hear any noise from upstairs.\u201d\n\u201cGood, Now your room is right there, just get your clothes and let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, come on up, I need someone to watch out.\u201d\n\nYou head into your room and Julie climbs up and keeps a nervous eye out. You start going through and grabbing clothing.\n\n\u201cHey Julie, what about you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat about me what?\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cAll your clothes are still in your bags upstairs, what are you going to wear?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I\u2019ll wear your clothes or go naked! I\u2019m not heading up there!\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t even hear any noise and I had quite a few favorite belongings in one of the bags. Fuck it, I\u2019m going up there, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Kelly\u2019s body anyway.\u201d You say and pass Julie to head upstairs.\n\nOnce again Julie follows reluctantly.\n\nYou go up the stairs cautiously, once again expecting something to pop out at you. When you finally get up stairs, you expect the same thing, but after checking a bit, nothing is out of place from when you left it yesterday. No broken windows, no kicked in doors, and your bags are still in the same place where you dropped them when you got here.\n\nThen you lay your eyes on Kelly\u2019s body which hasn\u2019t been disturbed in anyway. You didn\u2019t see it when Julie did it since your back was turned, but part of Kelly\u2019s head is splattered on the wall and the rest of it is all over the floor.\n\n\u201cHeh, you blew her fucking head off.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really gross. Let\u2019s get our bags and head back, I\u2019m still worried that something might try to break in and I also don\u2019t want to dwell on what almost happened to you in this room. It\u2019s upsetting.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I just think I needed the closure of seeing her corpse. I know that probably sounds fucked up of me, but then again this whole week has been.\u201d You say grabbing one of your bags.\n\nBefore you or Julie can say anything else a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can\u2019t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n\u201c\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh shit! We need to get down into the shelter NOW!\u201d Julie exclaims.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get our asses moving then.\u201d\n\nYou and Julie grab your remaining bags and head back into the basement. You don\u2019t stop the haste until you\u2019re safely inside the shelter, though Julie\u2019s still a really stressed.\n\n\u201cOh shit! Oh shit! We were out there when that bomb went off! What if we\u2019ve experienced a lethal dose of radiation!? I don\u2019t want my hair and teeth to start falling out and coughing up blood! Oh fuck!\u201d Julie starts to say while pacing back and forth.\n\u201cJulie will you relax? First of all if it had been that close the impact should\u2019ve at least shattered the windows of the house. From the direction I saw the cloud, I\u2019d say it probably hit Security City and you know how far away that is. It probably wasn\u2019t even a large one.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re safe?\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019re safe from what you\u2019re worrying about yes. But I mean if nukes are going off, that means the end of civilization, as we know it at best. The world is going to become a lot more dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re in this shelter! We\u2019ve got supplies for years!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, if we\u2019re smart about conservation we probably can stretch out our supplies for I dare say a decade, but the thing is we\u2019re going to HAVE to explore the surface eventually, if only to gather more food and water. And if we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to need to prepare ourselves. I foresee a lot of use of that small exercise room in the future unfortunately.\u201d\n\nJulie sits down as if this hard reality is finally hitting her.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to survive this new world. I mean if what you\u2019re saying is true, and this week was just an indication of how bad its going to really be, then how useful am I going to be? I mean other than killing your psycho sister; I\u2019ve been completely useless in this crisis. Even with your sister, you came up with the plan to distract her; my dumb ass thought you were being serious at first when you told me to leave. You\u2019ve come up with all the plans and taken all the action. It\u2019s actually very impressive of how you\u2019ve managed to cope with all this\u2026I\u2019m just not as strong as you.\u201d\n\nYou sit down next to Julie and hold her hands.\n\n\u201cJulie, I didn\u2019t say this was going to be easy, but WE can do this. You have to have more faith in yourself Julie. And whether I come up with the plans or not doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been useless. I mean you still needed the courage to pull the trigger to kill Kelly right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t brave, I didn\u2019t want her to kill you.\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be tons of people wanting to do that to me in the future. So you\u2019ve already proven you\u2019ve got motivation to kill when necessary. And just think you also helped in tricking the National Guard without killing anyone.\u201d\n\u201cOh sure, just shaking my tits and ass at them. That\u2019s about all I AM actually good at.\u201d\n\u201cHey whatever works for your survival, but look we\u2019re together now. I need you just as much as you need me. We\u2019re not just friends anymore we have a stronger bond now, one that I want to last for a very very long time. I want to survive to enjoy your company and love for as long as I can. Would you really give up on that so easily?\u201d\n\nJulie smiles.\n\n\u201cNo I suppose I can\u2019t. You\u2019re right Suzy. You\u2019re always right.\u201d Julie says and hugs you. She then kisses you on the lips.\n\n\u201cI love you Suzy.\u201d She says.\n\u201cI love you too Julie.\u201d You answer.\n\nA brief pause of you both looking into each other\u2019s eyes and savoring the moment.\n\nWhile the next few moments are going to be filled with possibly the most fun you\u2019ve had this week, you are still thinking about how difficult things are going to be in the near future. Already now, you\u2019re thinking that the first order of business is going to be to get Julie to dry out from her drug abuse. (You can\u2019t afford for her to go through your supply of medical supplies after all) She\u2019s going to probably hate you while she\u2019s detoxing, but it\u2019s going to be for her own good.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just going to be one hurdle you\u2019ll have to jump, but you\u2019re not that \u201cgood girl\u201d that hid out in the basement from the rest of the world anymore.

He\u2019s surprisingly reasonable as well. Besides, they got enough problems ever since the Cult of Tiamat launched a full raid on them.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s another reason I don\u2019t like going out nowadays, the entire fucking town is a war zone between those two.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, I\u2019m just glad we don\u2019t live where the fighting has gotten the heaviest. It\u2019s almost like how it was when all those people were running around like rabid animals. Still never learned what caused that, weird that some people just suddenly went back to normal though.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of the cult, do you really believe they won\u2019t attack us anymore?\u201d Julie says.\n\u201cWell like with anything in this shitty world, nothing is certain, but Bobby has always been a true believer so when he came to us that night saying that Tiamat spoke to him in a dream saying that we were off limits due to recent losses, I\u2019m inclined to believe we don\u2019t need to worry about them for now. Personally I think it was that bitch Diana that kept targeting us specifically for sacrifice. She never did like me. Anyway Diana\u2019s dead and Bobby isn\u2019t under her influence anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about his new first wife though?\u201d\n\u201cHis sister Helen? I only met her a few times back when I was dating Bobby, but she was always okay to me. Seemed to almost want me in the fold as it were. Probably wanted an ally because her older sister Diana was a bully to her\u2026hmm might\u2019ve had something common I suppose.\u201d\n\nAs you get ready to relax for the night, Julie ceases talking for a moment and then speaks up again.\n\n\u201cHey, do you ever wonder what your life would\u2019ve been like if you\u2019d stayed with Bobby?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just asking do you think it would\u2019ve been easier?\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see how being the member of an insane cult would\u2019ve been easier and that\u2019s not even factoring in Diana who probably would\u2019ve been trying to kill me at every turn.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I think you would\u2019ve been okay. You would\u2019ve found a way to get over on her. Just think you would\u2019ve been a high priestess with followers or something!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I still would\u2019ve had to have shared Bobby with Helen and whatever other sisters he choose as a damn wife. Nope, I\u2019m not into polygamy.\u201d\n\u201cBut you weren\u2019t into girls either at one time and we wound up together.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little different Julie, we had a long history. I mean I don\u2019t even see you as a female. I mean I do, but (Sigh) \u2026you know what I mean! I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m not the sharing type when it comes to these things. What brought all this weird line of questioning all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I guess sometimes I play what if and I come up with all sorts of weird scenarios.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell okay for example, I can picture you still doing okay even if you made different choices in your life. Like I can picture you surviving and even thriving in this harsh world regardless of what you did. Me? I would\u2019ve been dead without you around. I just wonder sometimes if your life would\u2019ve been better without me. Silly I suppose for me to dwell on stuff like that.\u201d\n\nYou know Julie can still get a little self-conscious at times and would seem tonight is one of those nights. It was annoying at first, but as time has gone on, you\u2019ve actually grown to find it a little endearing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it\u2019s silly, because how could my life be better without you? I mean I have everything I want with you, what more could I want? To be a leader of one of the many dysfunctional groups out there? No thanks, I was already part of one dysfunctional group, I don\u2019t need to be part of another, let alone trying to lead them. I\u2019m perfectly happy down here in our shelter with ample supplies and spending the rest of my years with you. Now come over here.\u201d\n\nJulie walks over to you a bit demurely and you passionately kiss her and grab her ass in the process.\n\n\u201cMmm. Tell you what, since the town has become rather dangerous lately, why don\u2019t we stay in for a month or two? Maybe by that time, those idiots will have stopped or killed each off by then. You know we still have lots of supplies left, we can afford a nice romantic vacation of sorts from the world.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSee, you always have the good ideas.\u201d Julie says with a smile.\n\nAs the two of you embrace in the way lovers do, you realize Julie is right, you do have all the good ideas.\n\nAnd your best one was choosing to be with your best friend.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Barricade the house", "result": "Things are too hot out there right now.

Those shots might have the National Guard over here again, but at least we can point to a viable target this time.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat about your\u2026 um sister?\u201d Julie asks.\n\u201c(Sigh) Shit. I dunno. She\u2019s all wrapped up in bags right now, I guess I\u2019ll just throw her in the garbage can out in your backyard. It\u2019s near the door, so I won\u2019t have to linger too long.\u201d\n\u201cYou really want to throw her away like that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t fucking want to throw away my sister like she was just day old meatloaf, but I don\u2019t have many other options right now and if we are going to be stuck in this house for who knows how many days on end, I don\u2019t want my sister\u2019s chopped up corpse sharing it with us!

It takes two trips and a lot of paranoia, but you manage to get her all in the trash can without anything else attacking you or the military coming to check up on you again. You do hear a lot more shooting though, so you\u2019re guessing that maybe they\u2019re too occupied with something else. You finish up by shoving the refrigerator in front of the back door.\n\nJulie meanwhile is trying her best. She\u2019s got the front door barricaded well enough, but the windows leave something to be desired.\n\n\u201cJulie, anyone could crash through those windows right now. Don\u2019t you have like hammer and nails or something laying around?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t have a bunch of wooden planks either. Why the hell would I have that shit? I don\u2019t sit around thinking about how to best protect my home against a possible zombie attack!\u201d Julie answers.

Why don\u2019t you take a break and I\u2019ll handle this. I\u2019ll try to figure out a way to better barricade this place.\u201d\n\nJulie doesn\u2019t need you to say anymore and she immediately runs upstairs. You imagine she\u2019s probably going to pop some pills or something to mellow her out. At this point as long as she stays out of your way, you\u2019ll be able to get what you need to do accomplished.\n\nYou spend a good amount of time shoving as much furniture as you can in front of most of the ground floor windows. Something could definitely still break them and with enough force they\u2019d probably eventually knock through the furniture, but you\u2019re confident that you\u2019d at least have enough time to do something about it before they got in completely.\n\nStill, the gunfire and yelling from outside hasn\u2019t stopped the whole time you\u2019re doing this, there are a couple points where you hear some explosions too, so you\u2019re not exactly feeling completely relaxed about this situation.\n\nYou then start packing \u201cget a away\u201d bags with as many useful items as you can, just in case you need to leave in a hurry. One of your bags that you brought hasn\u2019t even been opened and is still full of clothing. You fill your other bags with more useful items like some of the non-perishable snack food Julie has, the duct tape you were using, a few of the bigger kitchen knives, loose batteries, some of the medicine in the bathroom, etc.\n\nYou then finish up with packing a few more of your personal items and then think if you do need to leave in a hurry, it probably would be best if you could drive out of here.\n\nYou head upstairs and start calling for Julie, but when you find her, she\u2019s laying on her bed in a semi-conscious state. She took something to calm herself just as you figured.\n\n\u201cJulie! Julie! Does Donna have a spare set of car keys?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMgh\u2026huh\u2026come to bed\u2026\u201d she says.\n\u201cJulie!

You\u2019re a little tired from all the running around and other activity you\u2019ve been doing to today, not to mention you\u2019re still wearing the clothing that you cleaned your sister up in. As much as you\u2019re hesitant to let your guard down, you absolutely feel the need to clean up.\n\nAfter a quick shower, you return to being on guard for something to happen. Anything. Julie of course is peacefully asleep and oblivious to anything that\u2019s going on at this time.\n\nYou peek out one of the second floor windows and see Guardsmen still patrolling, but it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s as many any more and you see a pile of what are probably bodies a little up the block. It does look like things have quieted down a bit, around here anyway. Who knows about the rest of the town.\n\nYou wonder if you shouldn\u2019t sneak out and leave while things are quieter, but Julie\u2019s not in any condition to leave now. And as inept as she\u2019s been today, you can\u2019t just abandon her. You\u2019ve just lost your sister, you\u2019re not going to lose your best friend as well.\n\nYou stay up late past midnight staying alert, but nothing happens.

The sight of this scares the shit out of you and it doesn\u2019t help that Johnny also gave her a little shove directly at you after he did it, which causes a nervous reaction of firing your pistol.\n\nYou don\u2019t hit Johnny though, you instead hit Julie and cut what little remained of her life even shorter. Her body falls on you and you scream when all the blood squirts all over you.\n\nYou attempt to push her off of you, but when you see Johnny looming over you, you try to bring your arm back up to shoot at him again, but this time he\u2019s got the advantage and he grabs your wrist, breaks it and takes the gun out of your hand before pistol whipping you in the face with it twice. Your head hits the floor as you lie there now with a broken nose.\n\n\u201cStupid bitch. You all are stupid bitches. I don\u2019t know why I ever think I\u2019m going to run into anything different. (Sigh) Still, I thought after your sister told me about you\u2026I thought you might be\u2026bah better get this over with, the fucking Guard probably heard those shots.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nYour last moments are seeing Johnny\u2019s knife coming down several times on your face.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Help Johnny", "result": "You decide that keeping a bit of distance from Julie might be for the best for now. After last night you don\u2019t want her to think you\u2019re lingering around her because there is something there between you two.\n\nJohnny seems a bit odd, but then you\u2019re certainly used to odd people. You grab a trash bag and start cleaning up left over beer cans.\n\n\u201cThanks, but you don\u2019t need to help me. Your girlfriend probably could use the help more than I do.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cWell I do live here now, so it\u2019s gotta get clean or I\u2019m living in a pig pen! And Julie isn\u2019t my girlfriend.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Sorry, I just assumed that you two coming out of the same room together\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEh, long story. But she\u2019s just my friend and I consoled her on a troubling topic. It got emotional and she slept in my room, though I\u2019m fairly certain Julie wishes it had gone farther.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I see. Well your sister didn\u2019t mention you had a girlfriend when she spoke about you last night, so I was sort of wondering.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I must\u2019ve really pissed my sister off yesterday if she was talking about me to a stranger. Would\u2019ve thought she would\u2019ve been focusing on other things during a party. What exactly did she say?\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t going to be anything I haven\u2019t already heard before from her, so go ahead.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026she was sort of drunk when she started talking to me. I was actually surprised, since a girl like her doesn\u2019t normally just go up and talk to a guy like me, well at least not when there are other guys around. Anyway, she at first propositioned me to go into the basement with her. When I declined, she got more hostile and started calling me a faggot and said I didn\u2019t know how to have fun just like her sister Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when she went on a tirade?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was about to leave her since it isn\u2019t my idea of a good time to be ranted at and insulted, but she grabbed my arm and practically forced me to listen. She went on about you being good and perfect and never doing anything wrong. Basically she said all this stuff about you as if they were supposed to be bad things, but I didn\u2019t see it. I guess that just made her even madder so she eventually told me to fuck off and later on I saw her leave with that group I mentioned earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYeah sounds like her. (Sigh) I jut hope she hasn\u2019t gone and done anything more stupid than usual. Family. What can ya do?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHeh, don\u2019t need to tell me. I had an older sister just like your younger one. Partied all the time, lot of sex, lot of drugs, pissed my mom off something fierce when we were still living with her.\u201d Johnny says continuing to pick up cans and placing them in a bag.\n\u201cOh I got an older sister too, but she\u2019s even worse than Donna.\u201d\n\u201cParty girl too huh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s just a fucking sadistic bully. Had to put up with her abuse for years.\u201d\n\u201cYour older sister sounds like my mother.\u201d\n\nWhile the tone of his voice reflects no anger though, you notice when Johnny mentions that, his hand crushes one of the beer cans he has. He looks at it briefly and then tosses it in the bag.\n\nYou wonder if you should stop talking altogether, but Johnny has already noticed that you\u2019ve been staring at what he\u2019s done.\n\n\u201cSorry, bad memories. I didn\u2019t meant to scare you there.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t scared, just more surprised. We can get off the topic of families.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, actually I was thinking we were kind of bonding a bit. Sounds like both of us come from fucked up families. Probably made us stronger right?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I mean I suppose I\u2019ve survived, not sure if that\u2019s the same thing. I mean this is like the second day I\u2019ve spent away from home. I only moved out yesterday and only then due to being under duress from my sister Kelly. I\u2019ve always been a bit introverted and spent most of my life avoiding the outside world.\u201d\n\u201cEh, you\u2019re not missing much. To be honest, I\u2019m almost jealous you managed to do it for so long. I\u2019m a bit of an introvert too, but occasionally I to mix with the crowd as it were. Just to see if I feel any different. Hence one of the reasons why I came to your friend\u2019s party last night.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd, I don\u2019t feel any different. Just like I figured. It\u2019s like I spoke with several other people last night even before your sister and everyone was just\u2026dull\u2026boring\u2026like they were just empty shells. Like they weren\u2019t even real people to me. To be quite honest before your sister started complaining about you to me, I was getting bored and nearly left the party.\u201d Johnny says as he motions over to a few of the sleeping lumps still in the living room.\n\u201cWhat about your friend that you came with?\u201d\n\u201cOh him? I came here independently of him. Hell, he didn\u2019t even show up. Really, he\u2019s more of an acquaintance than a friend anyway\u2026\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s eyes sort of glaze over when he says this and he breaks in the middle of his sentence. Almost like he\u2019s in a different \u201cplace.\u201d \u2018\n\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHrm? Sorry, I just kind of spaced out there. Anyway as I was saying, you haven\u2019t missed much by not being a social butterfly, I think this group here is proof of that. And as far as not being strong, you\u2019re stronger than you think. Despite coming from a dysfunctional family, you haven\u2019t succumbed to drug and sex filled escapism like your younger sister and you obviously haven\u2019t grown to become a mean bully like your older sister. The fact that you told me you spent the night consoling your best friend rather than indulging in some sort of meaningless hedonistic pleasure tells me that you\u2019re a kind and gentle soul. That\u2019s a rarity in this shitty world.\u201d\n\nYou have to admit, as strange as this Johnny is, you do get the sense he\u2019s being genuine when he says this to you.\n\n\u201cWell thank you Johnny.\u201d You say.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to converse more with him, you hear some loud noise coming from the second floor. You hear a man\u2019s voice and a female voice, and then a very familiar voice. Sounds like Julie and it sounds like she\u2019s gone back to distracting herself from last night\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cOh yes! Ohhhh yeah! Give it to me daddy!\u201d you hear Julie scream.\n\nA little disturbing choice of words considering what you both talked about last night.\n\nSome of the people sleeping in the living room are even awakened by this. One of them looks at his watch and immediately runs out the front door like he\u2019s late for something. A couple of others return to sleep.\n\n\u201cSounds like your friend is feeling better.\u201d Johnny says a little disdainfully.\n\u201cMm, well she always was one to get over things quickly. Well looks like we\u2019re all done in this room anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, hey why don\u2019t you take a break? I mean obviously we don\u2019t need to clean this place spotlessly. Your friend Julie is just going to have another party tonight right?\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cTrue. Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right. No point in me cleaning especially if Julie isn\u2019t even going to be helping anymore, but what about you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMe? Well I\u2019m just going to dump out the trash and maybe pick up a few more of the bottles in the kitchen on the way. I\u2019ll probably also take another pursue down in the basement. It was a mess down there, but I think I cleaned most of it. Nearly tripped on a bad step down there though. Anyway then I guess I\u2019ll head home, I need the sleep anyway seeing as I haven\u2019t been yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep here?\u201d\n\u201cNope. I\u2019ve been awake the whole time, but I find I\u2019m more of a night owl and don\u2019t sleep much anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWell I understand that, but I\u2019m just surprised you stayed. You told me you were getting bored with the party and were about to go home at one point.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but I also mentioned that after your sister complained about you to me, my interest was increased.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nYou pause because you almost can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s implying.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. Are you saying you just stayed at the party through the night AND this morning just to meet me at some point? Just solely based on what my sister bitched about to you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? You sounded interesting and after speaking with you I can see I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d\n\nJohnny smiles and you smile with a nervous laugh. On one hand it\u2019s a little stalkerish and combined with Johnny\u2019s oddness, he\u2019s starting to come off a lot creepier.\n\nOn the other hand, in a strange way you\u2019re sort of flattered. You always did attract the weird ones Suzy.\n\n\u201cWow\u2026I\u2019m not exactly sure what to say to that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo need to say anything. The pleasure of speaking with you is all mine. Oh but one more thing, did you want me to get rid of these useless sloths still sleeping in the living room before I leave?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re probably just going to be here for tonight\u2019s party, so might as well just leave \u2018em I suppose. No need to trouble yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, as I said, it was nice talking with you Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cIt was\u2026interesting talking with you too Johnny.\u201d You reply back and head towards your room as Johnny starts taking a couple of garbage bags to the kitchen.\n\nWhat a strange person. Even stranger is that your self-esteem has been a little boosted by Johnny\u2019s stalkerish behavior.\n\nBefore Johnny\u2019s praising of you, in the back of your mind you were still a little upset about Bobby and starting to realize you were alone again. Not that you had any major problems with being alone and you\u2019re certainly used to it, but it still was nice to have a boyfriend every now and then.\n\nAfter Johnny going on about how most people suck and putting you on a minor pedestal you don\u2019t feel as bad anymore about Bobby. Screw him right? He\u2019s the one missing out.\n\nYou enter your room and lock your door fully content on tuning out the rest of the world like you always do. You go back to fucking around on the Internet, playing games and when the mood strikes you, getting out your mechanical \u201cboyfriend\u201d who never disappoints you.\n\nHours pass\u2026\n\nEventually the silence from outside your door becomes less silent. Looks like Julie\u2019s party is getting started or at least getting louder.\n\nYou don\u2019t really pay it too much mind as you pretty much managed to block it somewhat yesterday, but then you get a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cJulie?\u201d you ask instinctively.\n\u201cUm, no it\u2019s me.\u201d A familiar voice answers.\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d you say and then slowly get up to answer the door.\n\nYou open it up a little and see Johnny standing before you (Along with some party people passing by in the hallway).\n\n\u201cHi again.\u201d He says with a brief smile.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Did you even go home?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yeah, I did, but just as I was finishing up in the kitchen, your friend Julie had come in to get some more booze. She mentioned that she appreciated my cleaning up and invited me back for tonight\u2019s party. So I came back.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cWell technically she also invited me to come join her and the couple up in her room, but I declined as you might aspect. Not an orgy guy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, which is why I\u2019m really wondering why you came back at all. I mean I have to live here, but this really isn\u2019t your thing. You said as much earlier today.\u201d\n\u201cI know what I said\u2026but I also said\u2026\u201d\nJohnny\u2019s expression becomes\u2026 not quite flustered, not quite angry, but more like he\u2019s having a hard time and you\u2019ve just put him on the spot.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Look. This is really difficult for me. I\u2019m probably coming off like a creepy stalker and god knows you probably get a lot of guys hitting on you\u2026but I like you. I know that sounds like third grade shit, but there it is. I really like you and I\u2019d like to get to know you better. That\u2019s why I came back tonight.\u201d\n\nOddly that was honest enough to actually be kind of charming. Lot better than the \u201cShow us your tits\u201d pick up line that you\u2019ve heard before.\n\nThen again, Johnny is still pretty damn weird and much like how you didn\u2019t want to lead on Julie; you don\u2019t necessarily want to lead Johnny on either.", "action_results": [{"action": "Invite Johnny in", "result": "What the hell, you weren\u2019t doing anything important with your time and you were thinking about making the first move yourself earlier today.\n\n\u201cJohnny, could you hold on one moment?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, okay.\u201d He replies.\n\nYou close the door again and hastily clean up your room a bit just so you don\u2019t have your underwear just lying around, let alone your vibrator. Feeling that your room and yourself are presentable, you open the door.\n\n\u201cCome on in Johnny.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re inviting me into your room? Are you sure?\u201d Johnny asks a bit surprised.\n\u201cWell if we\u2019re going to get to know each other better to see if we\u2019ve got potential, then I\u2019d rather do it in here one on one rather than out there with drunks possibly butting into our conversation. Besides, if I leave this room, its very well possible people will wander in and have sex in it.\u201d\n\nJohnny chuckles a bit at your remark as he walks in.\n\n\u201cWell I suppose all that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\n\nYou make your first move by putting your arms around Johnny\u2019s shoulders and kissing Johnny squarely on the lips. He\u2019s really surprised. To be quite honest, you\u2019re a little surprised at yourself as well since you aren\u2019t usually the forward type, but maybe Julie\u2019s party spirit has gotten a hold of you a little bit along with wanting to put more distance between yourself and any more lingering feelings you might have for Bobby.\n\nBesides, you get the impression for all his praising and stalkerish behavior; Johnny would still be too shy to make the first move.\n\nJohnny\u2019s reaction says that your instinct about that was entirely correct.\n\nHe pulls away fairly quickly after you\u2019re finished, he blushes a bit and then gives you a weird stare.\n\n\u201cWhat? I thought we were going to get to know each other.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this.\u201d Johnny remarks and starts backing away.\n\u201cWait, hold on. We weren\u2019t going to have sex! We don\u2019t even have to kiss anymore, I was just\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you can even finish, Johnny\u2019s already run out the door.\n\n\u201cGreat, Suzy. Some seductress you are. (Sigh)\u201d you say to yourself and close your door.\n\nIn any case, you go back to your laptop to help shut yourself out from the real world again. which wouldn\u2019t be that bad, but Johnny just flat out running away from you doesn\u2019t exactly put you in that great of a mood. You got dumped by a murderer and now you\u2019ve run off a stalker. What does that say about you?\n\nOh well at least things with batteries don\u2019t judge.\n\nA couple hours later you get another knock on the door.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSuzy, it\u2019s me Johnny. I need to talk.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not exactly sure if this is going to be a good idea, but you decide to at least hear him out.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Hold on.\u201d You say and get up to open the door. Johnny stands before you wearing a jacket and looking slightly more disheveled from the last time.\n\n\u201cWell? Are you coming in, I don\u2019t feel like keeping the door open for all the partying assholes to peer into.\u201d You ask.\n\nJohnny enters the room and you shut the door and walk back to your sofa.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I just want to apologize. I\u2019ve been thinking about this long and hard and I realize that I did the wrong thing.\u201d Johnny says pacing back and forth, rubbing his hands through hair.\n\u201cWell, maybe I did come on a little strong. I suppose if the roles had been reversed I would\u2019ve run away as well.\u201d\n\u201cNo, stop talking I need to get all this out. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I obviously have wasted my time and that I shouldn\u2019t have pursued you. I guess I just built you up in my head so much that I\u2026dunno\u2026I always do this\u2026fuck! Shit! WHY!?!\u201d Johnny says and hits himself in the head a couple times. He\u2019s starting to worry you.\n\n\u201cHey Johnny, you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP WHORE!\u201d Johnny screams and before you even can react he\u2019s already run up and physically assaulted you. You try to scream out, but punches you your face and another tight grip around your throat prevent that from happening. The loud music from the party and indifference of the shallow partiers from any potential noise you could\u2019ve made probably would\u2019ve been lost to those two factors anyway.\n\nWhen you\u2019re nearly unconscious and so dazed that you can no longer fight back, Johnny ceases his punches and reaches for something inside his jacket.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be quick, because even though you\u2019re a whore like the rest\u2026I still like you.\u201d Johnny whispers. \u201cI\u2026really wish this could\u2019ve worked out\u2026you were so beautiful\u2026\u201d\n\nYour last feeling is the blade of a sharp knife slitting your throat.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline", "result": "As charmingly strange as Johnny\u2019s awkwardness is you\u2019re still not quite ready to go jumping into a relationship with another guy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet Johnny. Really it is. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m not looking for another relationship right now. I just broke up with my boyfriend and I think I need to be by myself for a while.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBoyfriend? I see. I suppose a pretty girl like you would have a lot of them.\u201d Johnny says. You notice his tone sort of becomes \u201cflat\u201d when he says this.\n\u201cPfft hardly. He was my first and only one.\u201d You say.\n\nAnd as quickly as his demeanor changed before, it changes AGAIN just as quickly. Before you got the impression he was almost pissed upon hearing you even HAD a boyfriend despite the fact he was your ex. After your additional information, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s perked up again.\n\n\u201cAh, okay\u2026I understand. First love and lost. Been there before. Say no more, I\u2019ll leave you be. It was a long shot anyway.\u201d\n\nJust as Johnny is about to leave, you sort of feel like you should say something helpful.\n\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good guy Johnny, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some girl out there for you.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but she probably killed herself when she found out I was the guy for her.\u201d Johnny says with a small chuckle.\n\n\u201cAnyway, thank you for being upfront and trying to be encouraging. I must say though, whoever your ex was, he must\u2019ve been an idiot to let you get away.\u201d\n\nYou watch as Johnny disappears into the crowd and you shut your door.\n\nHaving dealt with your momentary break up of your usual routine, you briefly check your phone for the time and to see if maybe your sister tried to call (You still think she probably got hauled in by the cops) but nobody has called.\n\nHaving little else to do, you go back to what you were doing before.\n\nHours pass and you start to get hungry which unfortunately means you\u2019re going to have to brave going out there and raiding the kitchen assuming there\u2019s even anything in there.\n\nYou exit your room and find that the party is still as lively as ever. Nobody pays too much attention to you as you creep through the crowd.\n\nThe kitchen is a complete wreck. You don\u2019t exactly know what went on in here, but there is some guy lying face down on a broken kitchen table. His head is bleeding and there are several broken beer bottles all over the floor. You almost hesitate to step inside the room, though there are a couple of other people just standing around in the kitchen drinking as if nothing was wrong.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d You say. \u201cDoes that guy need an ambulance?\u201d you ask.\n\nEventually one of the people in the kitchen realizes you were asking them.\n\n\u201cHrm? Oh him? Yeah he\u2019s fine. Just got drunk, got into a fight and then well as you can see he wasn\u2019t the winner. He does this all the time.\u201d A girl says in a bored tone.\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019d appreciate it, if he and whoever else was involved hadn\u2019t wrecked the goddamn kitchen in the process!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal and what concern is it of yours? It\u2019s Julie\u2019s kitchen and she won\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cI happen to live here so it actually is somewhat of my concern, and where is Julie anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Probably getting fucked as usual. Still don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried about it. Besides some weird guy said he was getting something to clean up the mess anyway.\u201d The girl says and goes back to talking with the guy she was previously talking to.\n\n\u201cWeird guy?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\u201cHey, Suzy.\u201d\n\nYou turn around and see Johnny behind you with a broom, a dustpan and some sort of cleaning product.\n\n\u201cJohnny, what are you still doing\u2026wait, have you been lingering all night around hoping that I might come out of my room?\u201d\n\nJohnny looks away a bit as if you hit the nail on the head.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026actually at first I was kind of hoping that maybe you\u2019d change your mind and come running out of your room to find me. A silly storybook fantasy really\u2026but then after about an hour of indulging in that delusion I realized I needed to accept reality. I was going to leave, but then I suddenly got offered a video game controller from a guy that stopped playing, so I started playing. I ended up getting sort of wrapped up in the game, shooting people in the face, murdering hookers and such. Sort of fun, and made me feel better.\u201d\n\nJohnny passes you by and starts sweeping up broken glass and continues talking.\n\n\u201cAfter my escapism with virtual violence then I decided to go home, but then I heard about a fight going on in the kitchen so I decided to be a spectator, but by the time I got here, it was already over and the winner went out the back door. I didn\u2019t think it was right to just leave your kitchen like this even if nobody else cared, so I tried to find your friend Julie because I didn\u2019t want to bother you again since you made your feelings quite clear to me and I didn\u2019t want to look like a stalker.\u201d\n\u201cA little late for that, Johnny.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, well anyway I couldn\u2019t find her. I asked around and someone said she left wit ha couple guys. So not knowing what else to do, I just decided to clean up the mess myself before I left.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute, are you telling me Julie isn\u2019t here for her own fucking party?\u201d\n\u201cUh, no it appears she isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have to put up with the parties when she\u2019s actually here, but if she\u2019s not even going to be here then why the hell do you have to still put up with it? So much for Julie\u2019s sob story about going to turn over a new leaf after your talk. You\u2019re annoyed and to top it off you\u2019re still really hungry.\n\n\u201cGoddamnit all I wanted to do is get some food from the fucking kitchen\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cDid you want me to order a pizza for you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\n\u201cSo? I got some money, I\u2019ll be happy to buy you a pizza, I\u2019ll get you a drink too.\u201d\n\nActually you don\u2019t have anything against Johnny\u2019s offer, but you\u2019re hesitant to accept.\n\n\u201cJohnny, I\u2019ll accept your offer, BUT I don\u2019t want YOU to get it in your head that I owe you something because of it.\u201d\n\u201cThought never crossed my mind.\u201d Johnny says. He doesn\u2019t even seem hurt by your implication.\n\u201cOkay. Sorry, I got a little authoritative there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I get it. It\u2019s smart for you to lay that out there immediately. Anyway I\u2019ll call up the place and I\u2019ll get it to you when it\u2019s here. In the meantime you can go back and relax in your room if you wish.\u201d Johnny says continuing to sweep.\n\n\u201cOh. Um okay. Thanks. Hey, do you think we should call an ambulance for that guy on the floor?\u201d you ask Johnny.\n\u201cHim? Nah, he\u2019s fine. I actually checked him soon after I came in here. Really I would\u2019ve rolled him over on his back, but with all the broken glass on the floor I probably would\u2019ve done more harm. Anyway I got this, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nWell he might be a weird guy who seems creepy at times and is definitely stalking you a bit, but at least he\u2019s helpful which is more that can be said for Julie who has seemingly just abandoned her own party. You try to call her up, but you get no answer, but you weren\u2019t really expecting one anyway.\n\nStill it is weird that she left. Julie\u2019s always been irresponsible, but she\u2019s like you in that she barely ever leaves the house. After all, why would she go get fucked, drunk and high elsewhere when she can do it right here?\n\nIn any case, she\u2019ll probably be back, and you go back to wasting your time on the Internet. After a half hour passes and there\u2019s a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cPizza delivery.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You answer and get up to open the door.\n\u201cHere you go. I ordered a standard pepperoni and cheese pizza and got you Coke. Hope that\u2019s okay, since I forgot to ask what you like.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll leave you be.\u201d Johnny says starting to leave.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what it is about this guy but\u2026\n\n\u201cHey Johnny, did you want some pizza?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh, nah. I\u2019m good. I ate a little earlier. I don\u2019t tend to eat much anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHm, don\u2019t eat much, don\u2019t sleep much. You sure you\u2019re human?\u201d you half joke.\n\nThis causes an unusual guffaw of laughter that you didn\u2019t expect from him.\n\n\u201cI sometimes wonder that myself.\u201d He says still chuckling. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your evening Suzy.\u201d\n\nJohnny once again disappears into the crowd in the living room and you lock your door.\n\nThe rest of your night is pretty much eating your pizza, drinking your coke, taking a quick shower and then eventually settling in for the night. You have no idea if the part is still going on outside, but the noise has decreased a little, so maybe it\u2019s starting to wind down.\n\nWell at least you don\u2019t need to share your bed this time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the hum of a vacuum passing the outside your door. You shake your head, because you know who that probably is.\n\nYou check your phone for the time and see that you\u2019ve slept through the morning as usual and nobody has called.\n\nAs you go through your bathroom routine of brushing your teeth and such, you ponder on whether or not you should check how trashed the house is or just stay in your room and not deal with it.\n\nUltimately you decide to check despite not really wanting to. Besides Johnny is obviously out there and you\u2019re going to have to do something about him.\n\nYou exit your room and find that the hallway is fairly clean and the hum of the vacuum is now coming from the living room.\n\n\u201cAt it again are you Johnny?\u201d you say walking into the living room. The living room is spotless and you notice that unlike the last time you don\u2019t see anyone flopped out on the floor or sofa.\n\n\u201cHi Suzy, did you sleep well last night?\u201d Johnny asks while turning off the vacuum.\n\u201cYeah. So did Julie ever come back?\u201d\n\u201cNope, I never saw her again. Guess she might\u2019ve stayed the night somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) I see. Is there anyone else here?\u201d\n\u201cNope, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that I eventually managed to kick everyone out of the house, of course some just left anyway, but I figured you\u2019d be glad to not have your home resemble a flophouse when you woke up.\u201d\n\u201cWait, so are you telling me there\u2019s nobody else here?\u201d\n\u201cNope, except me of course.\u201d\n\nThat makes you feel a little uneasy.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026okay\u2026\u201d you say and start backing away a bit. You briefly wonder how fast you could run to the back door and escape and then you wonder if you could run into your room and grab that pistol that\u2019s still in Julie\u2019s dad\u2019s desk.\n\nJohnny already senses your distress.\n\n\u201cShit. I\u2019ve done it again. I\u2019ve made you uncomfortable. I\u2019m sorry Suzy, I just\u2026I dunno. I don\u2019t mean to be creepy, I just wanted to make things nice for you.\u201d Johnny says and actually starts walking backwards from you in an effort to put you more at ease.\n\n\u201cJohnny, I know you mean well and I know that you like me, but like I said, I\u2019m just not ready for anyone right now.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know, I know you said so before\u2026but how can I win your heart if I don\u2019t continue to try? Couldn\u2019t we at least just talk more? I mean we really haven\u2019t gotten to talk a lot one on one with just us around.\u201d Johnny says.\n\n\u201cJohnny\u2026\u201d you start to say, but then you\u2019re interrupted from something loud outside.\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d Johnny says and walks over to one of the windows to peek.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, there\u2019s a bunch of military guys, a couple of military trucks and even an A.P.C. coming down the street!\u201d Johnny remarks.\n\nAt first you can\u2019t believe him, but that soon disappears when a loudspeaker is heard.\n\n\u201cATTENTION! THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW AND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW UNDER WATCH BY THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD. A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE WILL SOON VISIT ALL OF YOU AND ASSIST IN ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY NEED DURING THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY. STAY IN YOUR HOMES. DO NOT COME OUT FOR ANY REASON. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE.\u201d\n\nWell that is certainly something you didn\u2019t expect. You also don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do. Why is this town under marshal law? What the hell is going on?\n\nWhile you\u2019re not sure of why this is happening, Johnny has some thoughts on the matter though.\n\n\u201cWow, I really hope this isn\u2019t something serious, like some biological weapon or something\u2026but then I\u2019ve been watching the news while vacuuming and there\u2019s been no emergency broadcast about such a thing or anything. Just those Ground Zero infomercials, which have been increasing as of late.\u201d\n\nJohnny turns back to you.\n\n\u201cWell anyway, I suppose one upside to all this. With us being stuck inside, we can talk and get to know each other better like I was suggesting before.\u201d Johnny remarks.\n\nWhile Johnny has been just slightly on the side of creepy there actually is no proof that he isn\u2019t just someone that lacks proper social skills and is a bit head over heels for you. And considering your last boyfriend was going around sacrificing people and could be very outwardly charming and charismatic, the way someone acts isn\u2019t necessarily who they really are deep down inside.\n\nMaybe if you did get to know Johnny a bit better, you might feel different. Not ready to spread your legs different, but if you like what you hear he might actually make that step towards \u201cwinning your heart\u201d as he put it. (Something about that phrase sounded so quaint that it actually was endearing)\n\n\u201cOh\u2026all right. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything better to do at this point, but I\u2019m warning you, don\u2019t get the wrong impression. This isn\u2019t a date or anything.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, no, I got it. I just want a chance that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAfter you sit on the living room couch and motion that he sit in the chair you begin.\n\u201cOkay then\u2026well what should we talk about first? It isn\u2019t like I\u2019m usually that much of a conversationalist myself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell what do you like?\u201d Johhny asks.\n\nA general question, but a perfectly reasonable one for getting straight to the point on wanting to know more about someone.\n\nThe funny thing is there isn\u2019t much about you to know. Since you don\u2019t get out much, you don\u2019t DO much. The only time you did get out a little more was when you were with Bobby, and you can\u2019t very well talk about shit you did with your ex.\n\nSo you mention hobbies such as watching movies, playing games, and reading shit on the Internet. (You leave out masturbation) Sounds like a pretty dull life to the average person, but Johnny doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find what I said boring?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSimple perhaps, but I wouldn\u2019t say boring. Are you happy?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was happier when I could live in my basement and not have to deal with the rest of the world, and it would\u2019ve been nicer to not have to put up with Kelly, but yeah I suppose I was happy just living like that.\u201d\n\u201cThen that\u2019s all that matters. Me? I\u2019ve been sort of drifting from place to place ever since I left home. To be honest it would be nice to have some place to call a permanent home, but something always happens and I end up having to move on again. As you might aspect I\u2019ve had several lines of employment, I\u2019m not rich but I suppose I at least know a little bit of everything to make a living.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve had way more luck in that department at least. I\u2019m flat broke and can\u2019t even get a job. So why did you leave home in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cIt was time. Really don\u2019t want to go back either. Not fond of the memories\u2026 so hey did you hear from your sister? I mean did she call or leave a message or something?\u201d Johnny asks, changing the topic.\n\u201cNope, and now with this marshal law thing going on, I\u2019m a little concerned about her. Julie too. Who knows where the hell either of them are. I\u2019m even wondering if I should call my brother Peter to see if things are all right with him, though I imagine he\u2019s probably fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a brother too? Wow, two sisters and a brother. You have a big family.\u201d\n\u201cI actually had an older brother Ben as well, but he died.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Sorry to hear that. Should I ask how?\u201d\n\u201cHe killed his family and then blew his brains out in our house.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait\u2026what? Why?\u201d Johnny says a bit off guard.\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t there for the final show, but he apparently thought the government was coming to get him and that it would be better if he killed his wife and son rather than they get captured and brainwashed. Something like that. He always was paranoid and just got worse as he got older.\u201d\n\u201cI see. And you say there was no truth to his stories about the government?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? I mean just because you\u2019re paranoid, doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t still trying to get you.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure if he was that much of a threat to the government they would\u2019ve assassinated him long before he killed himself. And even if they were out to get him, there wasn\u2019t any need for him to kill his wife and kid.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess I can just see it from his point of view. He genuinely believed in his mind that the government was going to get him and seeing it as a losing battle and not wanting to lose those he loved to the enemy, his act of killing them was out of love. Kind of romantic really.\u201d\n\nJohnny is so deadpan, you think he\u2019s attempting some sort of dark humor, but you realize he\u2019s being completely serious. Somehow you\u2019re not really surprised.\n\n\u201c\u2026yeah well I\u2019m just glad he didn\u2019t love me then\u2026\u201d you remark.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s the case too.\u201d Johnny says with a smile.\n\u201cSo what about you? You said you had a mother and an older sister.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cOh them. Eh, not much to tell I suppose. Like I said yesterday, your younger sister sounds very much like my older one, and your older sister sounds very much like my mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou mother participated in illegal underground fight clubs and roller derby races?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Wait, your sister really does all that?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cYeah, so what makes your mom so bad?\u201d\n\u201cVery domineering. Verbally abusive, sometimes physically. Emotionally too I guess.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d\n\u201cDunno, never knew him. Took off before I was born. My sister is only one year older than me, so she doesn\u2019t remember him either. Just know that my mom hated his guts. Didn\u2019t keep any pictures of him. What about yours?\u201d\n\u201cEh, he was a travelling lightning rod salesman, so it was like he was never home. When mom died of the flesh-eating virus though he was practically home all the time and just gradually drank himself to death over the years. Still wasn\u2019t really there for any of us.\u201d\n\nJohnny nods and continues the conversation.\n\n\u201cAfter hearing about your family\u2026I\u2019m starting to wonder if I really had it all that bad and perhaps I just think I did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell like I said, my mother was very domineering, but I pretty much did what my mom said. I mean I hate to say I was a mama\u2019s boy, but I didn\u2019t really step out of line compared to my sister.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, sounds a little like me. Did pretty much what my mom told me too though she was the nicest one in my family. She probably was a little too sheltering of me though.\u201d\n\nYou go on a bit more about your mother since you\u2019re actually enjoying remembering the good times you did have with her. Johnny listens intently. Most of the time he looks like he\u2019s displaying happiness because you\u2019re mentioning positive memories, but sometimes you catch a glimpse of him looking away from you as if he\u2019s in another place.\n\n\u201cShe sounds like a very nice person and I can see where you get your kind qualities from. Sorry to hear that she died in such an awful way\u2026just yet another example of how you\u2019ve overcome so much hardship in your life.\u201d\n\nNow Johnny looks as if he\u2019s completely gone to another place. He stares downward vacantly, if he was staring in your direction, you\u2019d feel like he would be staring through you.\n\n\u201cJohnny? Johnny? You with me?\u201d you say.\n\nTakes him a few moments, but eventually he answers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling\u2026myself\u2026 I should go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Go? Where are you going to go? Are you sick?\u201d\n\nOnce again Johnny doesn\u2019t answer right away.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He answers.\n\nThe monotone voice he answers with, isn\u2019t exactly relaxing and you get the strong impression when he acknowledged that he\u2019s sick, he didn\u2019t mean physically.\n\nHe starts to get up, and he wobbles a bit. At first you think maybe he is physically sick, but then he also said he was tired. Considering he was cleaning up earlier, he probably never went home and stayed up all night again.\n\n\u201cJohnny you can\u2019t go out there, especially in your condition. The National Guard is out there, remember?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about some weekend warriors, I can be stealthy when I want to be. I\u2019m just glad you gave me a chance Suzy, but I fear I\u2019ve wasted your time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Johnny says and then attempts to walk out the front door, but his balance isn\u2019t the best.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s going on with Johnny right now, but it\u2019s even weirder than usual.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let him leave", "result": "As much you don\u2019t necessarily relish the idea of possibly sending a man to his death, he\u2019s not your responsibility and it\u2019s already weird he\u2019s been sticking around when there isn\u2019t anyone else here maybe it would be best if you let him leave especially if he\u2019s implying that he\u2019s mentally ill.\n\nBesides if he claims he can sneak past the National Guard, then who are you to disbelieve him.\n\n\u201cOkay, but you probably should go out the backdoor at least.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, good idea. You\u2019re so thoughtful to look out for my well being. I just wish\u2026things could\u2019ve been different\u2026\u201d Johhny says and starts stumbling back towards the kitchen.\n\nYou follow Johnny just to make sure he doesn\u2019t fall or something similar. When you reach the kitchen you\u2019re impressed with how clean it is. You\u2019d never know there was a drunk fool lying on a broken table yesterday.\n\n\u201cHow the hell did you get this so clean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m very (yawn) good at cleaning. Always have been. There\u2019s also some pizza and another drink for you in the fridge. I got an (yawn) extra one yesterday in case you got hungry today. Don\u2019t worry, I made sure nobody touched it.\u201d\n\u201cWow Johnny, that was pretty thoughtful. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. I just hope someone will be as good to you as you deserve. Goodbye Suzy.\u201d Johnny says and walks out the backdoor.\n\nYou walk to the door and peer out the window to see if he\u2019s going to jump the fence, but you see him walk around the house. You hope he isn\u2019t going to try to go through the front gate again and is just going to cut through a neighbor\u2019s yard.\n\nYou run back to a couple of other rooms peering out windows, but you don\u2019t see him anymore. You look out one of the front windows and he\u2019s not out there either. He must\u2019ve already made his escape you guess or at least you hope so.\n\nLacking any other ideas of what to do at this particular time, you grab the pizza and drink from the fridge and head back to your room. You also attempt to call up Donna, Julie and even Peter to see if you can find out more information on their situations, but you get no answer from any of them.\n\nAfter passing some time on your laptop, you suddenly hear a loud banging on a door.\nNot the door to your room, but somewhere in the house. Upon exiting your room, it sounds like its coming from the front door.\n\nYou remember that the loudspeaker from earlier did say there was going to be a government representative coming to visit the houses in the neighborhood.\n\nYou head to the living room and look through the door window and see a well-dressed man and one soldier at the door.\n\nSince you get the impression the government will most likely just break the door down if you don\u2019t answer the best thing you can do is be polite and accommodating.\n\nYou grab the handle\u2026\n\n\u201cGreetings miss. I\u2019m Mr. Zoll and I\u2019ve been assigned to be the government representative for this area. May we come in?\u201d Mr. Zoll asks, though it\u2019s pretty obvious that this is more of a polite formality rather than asking permission.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You answer and let Mr. Zoll and his soldier companion in.\n\nMr. Zoll sits on the chair while his soldier buddy stands nearby and you sit on the other side of the couch and ask what all this is about.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Suzy, so how can we help exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, before we start I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation. You\u2019re probably already concerned about what\u2019s going on and why this town is under marshal law in the first place.\u201d Mr. Zoll answers.\n\u201cIt is all a bit worrying.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. Unfortunately I can\u2019t talk about it too much, however I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that this town has experienced a vast increase in criminal activity and rioting. More than your police force can handle. So until we get the situation under control again, we\u2019re here to stay.\u201d\n\u201cWell I certainly can understand that. I haven\u2019t experienced any criminal activity in this neighborhood though, well at least not to my knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes this is one of the quieter ones. Some places I\u2019m hearing about are pretty bad. Anyway I\u2019d like to ask a few questions before deciding if we need to search this house further.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, okay then. I have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\u201cGood glad to\u2026 hear it.\u201d Mr. Zoll says.\n\u201cSo do you own this place?\u201d\n\u201cMy friend Julie does.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You\u2019re not the owner? Where is this Julie?\u201d\n\u201cUh, don\u2019t know. She skipped out on her own party yesterday and never came back home. She\u2019s a bit of a free spirit.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Mr. Zoll says and begins to write something down.\n\u201cWhy are you writing? Did I say something wrong? I mean not that I meant to say anything is wrong, that is. Everything is just fine! Ha ha.\u201d\n\nMr. Zoll\u2019s staring and questioning makes you nervous and now Mr. Zoll is looking at you a bit mistrustfully. He thinks something is wrong and now that you\u2019re shifting a bit uncomfortably, he starts to think you\u2019re covering up something even though you aren\u2019t!\n\n\u201cOkay, you know what. I think it\u2019ll be easier to just give a brief search of the house.\u201d Mr. Zoll says standing up to say.\n\u201cUm, all right then. I have nothing to hide as I said.\u201d You say.\n\nMr. Zoll tells his man to go take a quick look through all the rooms while the two of you stay in the living room. The soldier nods and follows his orders. He first goes upstairs and looks through. You half expect him to find a stash of drugs in Julie or Donna\u2019s room, but he either doesn\u2019t or that isn\u2019t their primary concern.\n\nNext the soldier comes back downstairs and searches the ground floor, but once again finds nothing that is going to get you into trouble.\n\n\u201cSearched everywhere sir, well except the basement.\u201d The soldier says when he comes back.\n\u201cWell you might as well search that too.\u201d Mr. Zoll remarks.\n\nThe soldier nods and heads back towards the hallway. You hear the door open to the basement and then a few footsteps going down and then nothing.\n\nYou and Mr. Zoll sit in silence for a while. You don\u2019t say anything, in fact you don\u2019t even look in his direction for fear of giving Mr. Zoll an excuse to do something else which might not be as pleasant as a simple search.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell is he\u2026shouldn\u2019t be taking this long\u2026 Jacobs! Jacobs! Did you find anything?! Because if not, we\u2019ve got other houses to go to!\u201d Mr. Zoll shouts.\n\nThere is no answer. Mr. Zoll calls again and still nothing. Mr. Zoll looks at you as if it\u2019s your fault.\n\n\u201cIs there someone down there?\u201d Mr. Zoll asks.\n\u201cWhat? No! I mean isn\u2019t your man Jacobs the only one down there?\u201d you say nervously.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you\u2026let\u2019s go find out shall we?\u201d Mr. Zoll says and then turns your nervousness into flat out fear by suddenly pulling out a pistol from his suit pocket.\n\nYou put up your hands and attempt to say you have no idea what\u2019s going on, but Mr. Zoll won\u2019t hear it, he\u2019s convinced you\u2019re hiding someone in the basement and you\u2019re going first down there. He also tells you to be completely quiet and not make any fuss or else he\u2019s just going to shoot you on the spot and have a squad come in and burn this place to the ground.\n\nMeekly you comply and you head towards the basement with Mr. Zoll pointing his gun at you from behind.\n\nYou reach the bottom of the stairs and you notice blood on the floor nearby and then suddenly a knife is plunged into your throat from an arm around the corner.\n\nYou fall to the floor in what almost feels like slow motion as you gurgle your last words and breathe your last breaths.\n\nWith your last vision from the cold basement floor, you think you see Johnny standing over you. You can\u2019t hear him, but he\u2019s obvious upset when he sees you. Then you see a burst of blood come out of his head and then you feel the heavy weight of his body collapse on top of you before the darkness envelopes your world.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Insist that he stay", "result": "Weird or not, you\u2019re not going to just let him potentially get shot.\n\n\u201cJohnny! You can\u2019t go out the front door! Look, just lie down on the couch okay? You can sleep here. It\u2019ll be all right.\u201d You say getting up and grabbing his arm.\n\nJohnny stares at your hand and then at your face.\n\n\u201cDo you mean it?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t let you go out there and get shot. I mean if you still want to leave then at least wait until its night and you\u2019ve had some sleep.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026so perfect\u2026\u201d Johnny remarks and starts to head back towards the couch.\n\nYou help Johnny back to the couch, and when he lies down he falls asleep almost immediately.\n\n\u201cI\u2026love you Suzy\u2026\u201d he says as he drifts off.\n\nWell there was nothing ambiguous about that. You start wondering if you should have your head examined for possibly enabling a possibly mentally unstable guy who\u2019s more than a little obsessed with you.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) What the hell is wrong with you Suzy? First it was a cultist, now it\u2019s this stalker. Are you deliberately picking crazy people as potential boyfriend material?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nYou stand over Johnny watching him sleep for more than a few minutes trying to figure out where you actually stand with this guy. As you do so you never noticed how cute he really is before. It\u2019s true that he\u2019s somewhat average looking, but maybe it\u2019s due to him being in a more vulnerable position that he\u2019s coming off as more attractive and not creepy.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, you turn down the TV (Which is blaring a Ground Zero infomercial as usual) and leave Johnny to sleep. You stop in the kitchen first in the hopes of maybe finding food before returning to your own room.\n\n\u201cWow, this place was a mess last night. How the hell did he get it so clean?\u201d you say as the kitchen is indeed much tidier without drunken fools and broken tables lying on the floor.\n\nWhen you open up the refrigerator, you surprisingly find another pizza box, which has been marked with a note saying \u201cProperty of Suzy, don\u2019t touch!\u201d Johnny must\u2019ve ordered another one for you last night in case you got hungry later. That was pretty thoughtful, but what surprises you even more is its completely intact.\n\n\u201cHe probably was acting like a guard dog all night near the refrigerator in case someone tried to eat it.\u201d You laugh to yourself.\n\nGrabbing cold pizza and an unopened drink you head back to your room and lock the door.\n\nStill wondering about them, you call up Julie, Donna and even Peter, but you get no answer from any of them.\n\nJust as you briefly pondering about calling Kelly too, you hear a loud banging on a door. Not the door to your room, but somewhere in the house. Upon exiting your room, it sounds like its coming from the front door.\n\nYou remember that the loudspeaker from earlier did say there was going to be a government representative coming to visit the houses in the neighborhood.\n\nYou enter the living room and find Johnny awake again. He still looks pretty tired.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the government rep.\u201d you say, then you run over to the door and check through a window and see a well dressed man and one soldier at the door. You grab the handle\u2026\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re just going to let them in?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cWell I doubt if they\u2019re going to just go away. What can we do? Barricade ourselves in until they bash the door down? I don\u2019t like it either, but it isn\u2019t like we have too many options. Besides I don\u2019t have anything to hide, do you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Johnny replies.\n\u201cWell there you go then, we might even be able to find out some answers too.\u201d\n\nYou open up the door.\n\n\u201cGreetings miss. I\u2019m Mr. Zoll and I\u2019ve been assigned to be the government representative for this area. May we come in?\u201d Mr. Zoll asks, though it\u2019s pretty obvious that this is more of a polite formality rather than asking permission.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You answer and let Mr. Zoll and his soldier companion in.\n\nWhen you turn around you see that Johnny is sitting up on the couch, but is propping his head up on the armrest. He\u2019s still really sleepy so you\u2019re not surprised to see a bit of a scowl from him. You just hope the others don\u2019t take it the wrong way, but you figure as long as you\u2019re polite and upfront, you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems.\n\nMr. Zoll sits on the chair while his soldier buddy stands nearby (eyeing Johnny mostly) you sit on the other side of the couch with a space between you and Johnny and ask what all this is about.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Suzy, and that\u2019s Johnny over there. So how can we help exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, before we start I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation. You\u2019re probably already concerned about what\u2019s going on and why this town is under marshal law in the first place.\u201d Mr. Zoll answers.\n\u201cIt is all a bit worrying.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. Unfortunately I can\u2019t talk about it too much, however I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that this town has experienced a vast increase in criminal activity and rioting. More than your police force can handle. So until we get the situation under control again, we\u2019re here to stay.\u201d\n\u201cWell we certainly can understand that. We haven\u2019t experienced any criminal activity in this neighborhood though, well at least not to my knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes this is one of the quieter ones. Some places I\u2019m hearing about are pretty bad. Anyway I\u2019d like to ask a few questions before deciding if we need to search this house further.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, okay then. We have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\u201cGood glad to\u2026 hear it.\u201d Mr. Zoll says glancing over at Johnny who is still alternating between being sleepy and unhappy about being awake.\n\u201cSo which one of you owns this place?\u201d\n\u201cMy friend Julie.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Neither of you are the owner? Where is this Julie?\u201d\n\u201cUh, don\u2019t know. She skipped out on her own party yesterday and never came back home. Isn\u2019t that what you said Johnny?\u201d\n\u201cHrm. Yeah.\u201d Johnny mumbles.\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Mr. Zoll says studying Johnny though you don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s making you nervous though.\n\n\u201cIs this man your boyfriend?\u201d Mr. Zoll suddenly asks.\n\u201cUm\u2026yes! Yes he is. He hasn\u2019t had much sleep. You see we had a party last night and he stayed up late cleaning up. He really shouldn\u2019t have, but that\u2019s just how he is!\u201d you nervously laugh being completely caught off guard by the question.\n\nIn your mind you already are regretting saying that since you\u2019ve sent out more than enough mixed messages to Johnny. Though when you look over at Johnny he doesn\u2019t make any facial signs of a positive or negative nature, he\u2019s too busy on struggling to stay awake.\n\nMr. Zoll is now looking at you a bit mistrustfully. He thinks something is wrong and now that you\u2019re shifting a bit uncomfortably, he starts to think you\u2019re covering up something even though you aren\u2019t!\n\n\u201cOkay, you know what. I think it\u2019ll be easier to just give a brief search of the house.\u201d Mr. Zoll says standing up to say.\n\u201cUm, all right then. We have nothing to hide as I said.\u201d You say. Johnny slightly awakens a bit at this remark, but otherwise he continues to say nothing.\n\nMr. Zoll tells his man to go take a quick look through all the rooms while the three of you stay in the living room. The soldier nods and follows his orders. He first goes upstairs and looks through. You half expect him to find a stash of drugs in Julie or Donna\u2019s room, but he either doesn\u2019t or that isn\u2019t their primary concern.\n\nNext the soldier comes back downstairs and searches the ground floor, but once again finds nothing that is going to get you into trouble. Johnny briefly turns his head to watch the soldier as he moves back and forth up and down the hallway.\n\n\u201cSearched everywhere sir, well except the basement.\u201d The soldier says when he comes back.\n\u201cWell you might as well search that too.\u201d Mr. Zoll remarks.\n\nThe soldier nods and heads back towards the hallway. Johnny doesn\u2019t look at the soldier this time, he just closes his eyes.\n\nYou hear the door open to the basement and then a few footsteps going down, then all of a sudden\u2026\n\n\u201cOh shit! That basement has a bad step!\u201d Johnny exclaims and goes running down the hallway and shouts at the soldier.\n\nMr. Zoll gets up and starts to yell at Johnny to come back and you call out to him as well. This is soon followed by both the soldier and Johnny yelling and then the sound of someone falling down the stairs.\n\nAt this point you and Mr. Zoll both run towards the basement and there you see Johnny in the stairwell and the soldier crumpled in a heap at the bottom. His neck doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s supposed to be twisted that way.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I tried to stop him from falling\u2026\u201d Johnny exclaims looking distressed.\n\u201cHis fucking neck is broken! I can see it from here! You killed him!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t! I tried to save him! I shouted about the step!\u201d\n\u201cBullshit! And YOU\u2019RE lying too!\u201d Mr. Zoll says pointing to you as well. \u201cSomething fishy is going on here and I dunno what it is, but BOTH of you are going to pay for it!\u201d\n\nMr. Zoll reaches for something in his suit pocket\u2026\n\nPanic washes over you and it\u2019s in situations like this that sometimes people either freeze up or make a rash decision.", "action_results": [{"action": "Do nothing", "result": "The panic is overwhelming and you completely freeze up. Even when Mr. Zoll pulls a pistol out of his pocket you still do nothing. It\u2019s like the next few moments are in slow motion to you.\n\nYou watch Johnny attempt to run up the stairs, but Mr. Zoll turns quickly and fires two shots, one in Johnny\u2019s chest and another in his head. Johnny falls backwards down the stairs and his body falls in heap on top of the dead soldier.\n\nYou don\u2019t even scream when seeing this, but your crippling frozen panic ends and you instantly make a run for it. Mr. Zoll attempt to grab you, but you\u2019re too fast.\n\nYou actually get to the front door before you hear Mr. Zoll tell you to halt or he\u2019ll fire. You can\u2019t stop though, you\u2019re too afraid for your life.\n\nUpon opening the door, you feel a piece of hot lead going into your back and then another.\n\nYou slump face first onto the front porch. Tears in your eyes and screaming from the pain you attempt to drag yourself forward, but it\u2019s all for naught. Mr. Zoll casually walks up to you and ends your suffering with a final bullet to the head.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Do something", "result": "Seeing that Mr. Zoll is threatening you and going for something in his pocket you do the only thing that you can think of that comes to mind.\n\nYou shove him as hard as you can towards the stairs. With one hand in his suit pocket he can\u2019t quite catch his balance and he goes tumbling backwards down the steps.\n\nJohnny just manages to get out of the way of Mr. Zoll\u2019s tumbling body and soon it hits the bottom just like his buddy did. Mr. Zoll however starts groaning in pain indicating that he\u2019s only hurt. He isn\u2019t dead\u2026well at least not yet.\n\nStill in shock from what you have done, you stand motionless as you see Johnny take advantage of Zoll\u2019s prone condition and begins stomping on his head. Several times. Then he grabs the soldier\u2019s rifle and begins smashing the butt of it into Zoll\u2019s face. You\u2019re not right up front for this gruesome display; you can still see the blood flying from where you\u2019re standing.\n\n\u201cDie! Die motherfucker! Fucking piece of shit!\u201d Johnny starts muttering as he continues to destroy Zoll\u2019s skull structure.\n\nAfter a few seconds of watching this, you snap out of it.\n\n\u201cJohnny! Stop! He\u2019s dead! He\u2019s dead\u2026(sob) he\u2019s\u2026dead\u2026\u201d you say and break down. You feel sick and run into your bathroom. You cough and vomit into the toilet, but it isn\u2019t so much your contributing to Mr. Zoll\u2019s death or watching it unfold, it\u2019s mainly because you\u2019re sick with worry right now about the repercussions of such actions.\n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026oh god\u2026what did I do\u2026\u201d you say in between heaving and crying.\n\nAt this point Johnny has come up from upstairs to check on you. As you look over from hovering over the toilet, you see him standing before you in your bathroom doorway and blood on his clothes.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026Suzy\u2026calm yourself. You did what you had to do. The guy didn\u2019t give you much of a choice. I checked his pocket and he was definitely packing a pistol in it. If you hadn\u2019t pushed him, he might\u2019ve very well shot you and me both.\u201d Johnny says in an attempt to console you, but it\u2019s not working very well.\n\n\u201cThey\u2026they\u2019re going to send more people to look for him\u2026they\u2019re going to find out\u2026we can\u2019t even run. There\u2019s military everywhere!\u201d you say before heaving some more, but you\u2019ve nothing left. You\u2019re just shaking.\n\nJohnny steps towards you.\n\n\u201cSuzy. Suzy. We\u2019re going to be fine. Remember WE didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. These assholes came invading our space and then acted in a threatening manner even after we both tried to be accommodating to them.\u201d\n\nYou stand before Johnny who now has grabbed a small washcloth and is approaching you with it. You just continue to tremble.\n\n\u201cSuzy. Listen to me. I can clean up the mess in the basement. I\u2019ll make it so nobody will ever know. Okay? If more weekend warriors show up at our door asking about their boss or whoever that dickhead was to them, we\u2019ll just say he left and that they can search the damn house if they want. They won\u2019t find his body. They won\u2019t find ANY body. Trust me on that.\u201d\n\nJohnny dabs the sides of your mouth with the washcloth. You at him with a mixture of fear and hopefulness. All you can think about right now is how you wish all of this would go away.\n\n\u201cCan\u2026can you really make all this go away?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, I can. And in the event that we have to run, we DO have that option. We aren\u2019t prisoners here despite what the government wants us to think. We\u2019re free to go anywhere we wish.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I want to go home\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s where we\u2019ll go then.\u201d\n\nJohnny now holds both of your hand in his and looks into your eyes.\n\n\u201cSuzy. I love you and I\u2019ll never let any harm come to you. If the worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll take all the blame for what happened today. I don\u2019t want you to worry about this any more. You\u2019ve been brave enough for one day.\u201d\n\nHis eyes they\u2019re so piercing right now. They give off an almost commanding stare. His voice is so soothing though and it\u2019s actually making you feel slightly at ease.\n\nThe combination of you having a minor breakdown and the stress of all that\u2019s going on\u2026well it\u2019s all enough for you to just accept Johnny\u2019s willingness to step up and solve all your troubles like some sort of white knight.\n\nAt least right now at any rate.\n\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to your bed. You need to rest.\u201d Johnny says and starts to guide you back to your room. You don\u2019t resist. You just go with it. Johnny is a perfect gentleman though; he doesn\u2019t attempt to touch you in any manner that might be inappropriate.\n\nAs you lay down the bed, you allow yourself to start giving into the wave of sleep that\u2019s hitting you from all the mental exhaustion you\u2019re going through.\n\n\u201cOkay, Suzy, I\u2019m going to get to work. Now I\u2019ll close your door and leave you be, but if you need anything at all, just call me of course. Just don\u2019t get up, you don\u2019t need to put yourself through anymore trouble.\u201d\n\nYou nod at Johnny\u2019s remark as you start to close your eyes. It\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago he was the one exhausted and you were still relatively lively. You have no idea where he gets his energy from.\n\nJust as Johnny is about to leave. You call out.\n\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nYour eyes are still closed so you don\u2019t see Johnny smile at you before exiting your room.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou are suddenly awakened by the sound of your phone.\n\nYou don\u2019t think, you don\u2019t look, you just instinctively grab it and answer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d you answer still slightly groggy.\n\u201cSuzy? It\u2019s Peter.\u201d\n\u201cPeter?\u201d you say a little surprised he returned your call as well still shaking the cobwebs out from coming out of your sleep.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. You called me yesterday, but I was busy with, well a bunch of shit really. It\u2019s sort of crazy around here, the National Guard is shooting people in the street\u2026well at least I think they\u2019re still people.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that I\u2019ve been seeing some weird shit. Like several people running around trying to bite other people.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026what? You mean literally trying to bite people?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I mean bite, as in I saw one guy that lived down the street from us chase another neighbor and start chewing on him like he was out of a goddamn zombie movie!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026are you saying this guy was a zombie?\u201d\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t know. I mean maybe he was just rabid or something, but this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Maybe it\u2019s a disease outbreak, or bio-weapon accident or something. I mean that would explain why the National Guard is here. I\u2019m just glad they or any of those freaks haven\u2019t beat down the door to this house yet, but I\u2019m not taking any chances that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been trying to find Ben\u2019s shelter.\u201d\n\u201cBen\u2019s shelter?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know the one he was always working on and changing the fucking entrance all the time on? I figure it\u2019s probably still well stocked and I intend on riding this whole fucked up situation in the safety of that thing until everything is back to normal. We haven\u2019t had much luck in finding it though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe? Is Kelly there helping you?\u201d\n\u201cKelly? Nah, I haven\u2019t seen that Amazon cunt since she left for work on Monday night. Don\u2019t know where she is. I\u2019m here with one of my\u2026clients. Anyway how are you and Donna?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Donna is. She left Julie\u2019s on Monday night and never came back, then Julie left on fucking Tuesday night and SHE never came back. Then on Wednesday\u2026(sniff)\u2026\u201d\n\nYou begin to feel a wave of emotion hit you as the thought of what happened yesterday catch up to you again.\n\n\u201cSuzy?\u201d Peter asks.\n\u201c(Sob) I think\u2026I think I\u2019m gonna be in a lot of trouble Peter\u2026(Sob) Something terrible happened\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t continue and you begin to cry.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026 look I\u2026\u201d Peter is unsure of what to say for a moment and then he continues.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over there, but I really need to let you go. I was actually hesitant to call you since I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to talk on the phone long right now anyway. I mean who knows if the government is listening\u2026so\u2026\u201d\n\nYou stop crying immediately and just stare at your phone in disbelief.\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait. Just fucking wait a minute. Granted we\u2019ve never been close Peter, but I have been genuinely concerned about you as soon as the National Guard rolled up in this town. Why the hell do you think I called? I\u2019m obviously distressed about my current situation and you don\u2019t even offer a sympathetic ear? After all the fucking times you\u2019ve stolen my clothes? After all the goddamn times I had to put up with your old loser junkie friend Kevin perving on me when you thought you were some sort of film maker? You can\u2019t even make the fucking effort to even PRETEND to care a little? You can\u2019t even do THAT for me?\u201d you shout.\n\u201cSuzy, what the fuck do you want me to do? You\u2019re over there and I\u2019m over here. I mean I got my own shit to worry about. And you how this family operates, when the shit goes down, you fucking look out for yourself first.\u201d Peter says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to jump in your car and save me, I just wanted a little\u2026fuck it\u2026you know what just fuck you Peter!\u201d you shout and hang up\n\n\u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d you shout and throw your phone against the wall just as Johnny comes walking in.\n\u201cI heard you shouting, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cMy fucking brother is a goddamn selfish bastard that\u2019s what\u2019s going on! I\u2019m fucking nervous, I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m afraid. And what does he do? Does he even make an effort to console me in any way? No of course not he worries about himself. It\u2019s what my family does, out for number one as usual. Fuck all of them, I don\u2019t even care what happens to ANY of them any more!\u201d say sobbing.\n\nJohhny approaches you, but still keeps a respectable distance.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you don\u2019t need to worry about them any more. They aren\u2019t even worth getting mad about okay? Look I\u2019m here and I\u2019ll take care of everything. Speaking of which, that thing yesterday\u2026.\u201d\n\nYou wipe your eyes and try to compose yourself.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to hear anymore about it\u2026 I just don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI understand. I understand. I just wanted you to know that it\u2019s all been taken care of.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, until they send someone to find out what happened to him.\u201d You say.\n\nJohnny now steps in a bit closer.\n\n\u201cWell, they haven\u2019t yet and I doubt if they\u2019re going to right now. You\u2019ve been asleep for most of the day and you\u2019re probably not aware, but there\u2019s been some problems going on around the neighborhood I guess. In fact I actually went upstairs to check from one of the windows to get a better view and I saw them shoot a couple people a few houses down. Well I assume they were still people on some level, but they certainly weren\u2019t acting right. Like they were rabid or something. One got killed by multiple chest shots though so I think we can at least assume they aren\u2019t the living dead.\u201d\n\u201cHrm. Peter mentioned something like that happening in my neighborhood. He thinks it\u2019s a disease or biological weapon.\u201d\n\u201cWell he might be right on that somewhat. Seems like the Guardsmen would be equipped with gasmasks or something if it was something like though. I dunno. Anyway, as I was saying for all they know they might think that Zoll guy and his soldier buddy got bushwacked by one of those things yesterday. Besides, he went to several houses, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re automatically going to know it was us.\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s attempts at making you feel better don\u2019t really work, since it just replaces one concern of getting executed by the military for murder for another concern of getting possibly infected by whatever disease is turning people into \u201czombies.\u201d\n\nStill, he\u2019s the only one trying and actually here for you, and that\u2019s the sad part.\n\n\u201cJohnny, is that a uniform you\u2019re wearing?\u201d you say noticing he\u2019s changed his clothes.\n\u201cYeah. They\u2019re from that poor soldier that broke his neck on the stairs. I know it\u2019s a bit ghoulish, but my own clothes were shall I say, very\u2026 soiled after taking care of that business. Fortunately, the uniform seems to be a perfect fit. I was also thinking maybe it could also be a disguise in case we need to get the hell out of here.\u201d Johnny remarks.\n\u201cHm, could work, but I don\u2019t have a uniform.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI could always say you\u2019re a prisoner or survivor I found. In any case it might be...\u201d\n\nBefore Johnny can finish, he\u2019s interrupted by the breaking of glass coming from the kitchen followed by snarling and grunting.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Johnny exclaims and runs out of your room. You\u2019re not quite as eager to run towards the sound of danger, at least not until you grab the pistol out of the desk first.\n\nYou haven\u2019t gotten a few steps out of your room and you hear the sounds of a multiple shots being fired, followed by more glass breaking and an awful sound of anguish.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Johnny standing there with an assault rifle pointed at the bullet hole ridden back door. Must be the same rifle the soldier had. He turns around.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things. More of them must be wandering this way\u2026 where did that pistol come from?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cIt was in a desk. So you think more of those things are coming?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, just a hunch, but the gunfire outside doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s letting up. We could easily barricade ourselves in here, but who knows how long this thing is going to last.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think we could make it out of here ?\u201d\n\u201cI believe we could, but it does sound like a warzone out there right now.\u201d\n\u201cWell I hope my sister has another set of car keys because that\u2019s the only vehicle out there right now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHmm, well even if we did, I\u2019m fairly certain as soon as we drove out in it, we\u2019d be getting fired upon on. Even if we made it, there\u2019s going to be more military areas to drive through. Nevermind the fact that your sister\u2019s car isn\u2019t exactly sturdy looking enough to survive such an attack, there is also always the possibility of a bunch of those things gathering together to overturn the vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you saying we should go by foot?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, if it were just me, I might do that, but since your safety is a priority to me, I feel like we\u2019d have a better chance however if I stole one of those military jeeps I\u2019ve seen patrolling around.\u201d Johnny replies.\n\u201cAre you nuts? How the hell are we supposed to get one of those?\u201d\n\u201cNot we, me. I believe I could steal one. I have to admit I\u2019m a little tired though. Still haven\u2019t had a lot of sleeps, especially with\u2026 well you know. If I could just catch a little rest, I\u2019d probably be able to do it better under the cover of the night.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Johnny seems so sure that he can just steal a military vehicle is a little scary. Did he also serve in the military or something? He\u2019s never said. Come to think of it, he\u2019s still never revealed too much about himself. In any case that isn\u2019t quite your primary concern right now.\n\n\u201cWell if you really believe you can steal a jeep, I guess that\u2019s our best shot.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell we still should pack some bags with useful supplies first. I\u2019ll get some things from the basement since I\u2019m pretty sure I saw quite few things down there. You can check this floor and check the upstairs.\u201d\n\nJohnny heads back into the basement and you check upstairs first. You search Donna\u2019s room and you do find some keys. You\u2019re fairly sure that they are probably a spare set to Donna\u2019s car. After grabbing the practical pharmacy from the bathroom (Julie and Donna sure didn\u2019t reserve their drugs to just the illegal kind) you return to your own room and start repacking some of your clothes and some other personal items. A quick trip to the kitchen finds you a few bags of snacks and batteries. (And you looking over your shoulder constantly thinking that something is going to try to break in through the backdoor again)\n\nJohnny eventually comes up from the basement with an old looking bag of stuff. He\u2019s looking really tired now.\n\n\u201cJohnny are you going to be okay to do this? I mean I just found Donna\u2019s car keys. We could leave in that and I\u2019d drive.\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, our best chance is the jeep. We\u2019ll be riddled with bullets in that car. I\u2019ll be fine. Just need a few hours of shuteye. After that, I\u2019ll be ready to go. I guess I\u2019ll sleep on the sofa in the living room.\u201d Johnny says while walking off towards the living room with the bag and rifle.\n\n\u201cWell I suppose we should wait before leaving anyway, I\u2019d rather have you alert while we\u2019re on the road. Hold on a moment you look a little wobbly.\u201d You say and help him the rest of the way, which isn\u2019t far of course, but you feel like it\u2019s a nice gesture. Johnny certainly thinks so\u2026but then he tends to think everything you do is wonderful.\n\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m so tired. Even that gunfire going on isn\u2019t going to keep me awake.\u201d Johnny says, flopping down on the couch.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be awake, so even if something unexpected happens and you\u2019re still snoozing, I can wake you up.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Johnny says looking up at you. He almost reaches his hand out to touch your face, but quickly stops himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you had to call me your boyfriend yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You ask.\n\u201cYesterday, when you tried to lie to Mr. Zoll. You said I was your boyfriend. I know you were just saying that.\u201d Johnny says as he starts to close his eyes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t worry about that right now. Just rest like you should have been able to yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026God\u2026you\u2019re so perfect. You\u2019re so much better than me. I\u2019ve done a lot of bad things Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cI think after yesterday we\u2019ve both done a lot of bad things.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cNo\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d Johnny starts to say, but then he trails off.\n\nLeaving Johnny to sleep, you stay in the living room if only because you\u2019re a bit nervous to be by yourself right now. You turn the TV on and keep it on low, but as usual nothing of importance is on save for Ground Zero infomercials.\n\nLacking anything better to do (Other than being on edge a bit) you start to contemplate that if Johnny is successful WHERE you should go. You don\u2019t really have any good ideas either. You\u2019ve never been anywhere in your life, so why would you have any ideas on where to go now? And given how fucked up everything is right now, where would it even be safe to go?\n\nNo, the only place you\u2019ve ever felt safe and at home is your basement. How you wish you could return. Then as you watch the GZ salesman obnoxiously go on about their product, it hits you\u2026 why shouldn\u2019t you return?\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant thought, but who knows if Peter already found the hidden entrance to the shelter yet. He might very well be already be enjoying the shelter with his boyfriend or whoever he\u2019s got over there. You\u2019re fairly certain if that\u2019s the case, he isn\u2019t going to let you in to share it. That was clear when you spoke to him on the phone.\n\nSo where does that leave you? Leaving town to parts unknown? If that\u2019s the case, you imagine you\u2019ll have to leave that in Johnny\u2019s hands since he\u2019s mentioned he\u2019s drifted from place to place and probably knows more about possible locations to go to in an emergency than you do.\n\nOn top of all this, you still aren\u2019t quite sure what to do with Johnny. He\u2019s definitely gone a long way in trying to prove himself to you. He has possibly saved your life and is obviously willing to risk his for you. The only other person who has done that was Bobby. In some ways Johnny sort of reminds you of Bobby\u2026and that\u2019s also another reason why you continue to be leery of him.\n\nOther than his stalker behavior since you\u2019ve met him, you\u2019ve already come to the conclusion that Johnny probably has some sort of shady history. When you saw him finishing off Mr. Zoll\u2026well it wasn\u2019t exactly a normal reaction. He didn\u2019t just react out of a panic like you did when you pushed Zoll down the stairs, Johnny got frothing mad. An anger you\u2019ve never seen him display so outwardly before.\n\nBetween that and his mumblings of \u201cdoing bad things\u201d and you\u2019re inclined to believe that whatever his past might be, that Johnny HAS killed before.\n\nAnd probably the more fucked up thing is that it doesn\u2019t exactly bother you, or rather it doesn\u2019t bother you like it should a normal person. Bobby used to kill people on a regular basis and while it took a little time for you to build complete trust in him, you did it and you had a relationship out of it. (And the funniest thing is that it didn\u2019t even end in bloodshed)\n\nThe question is, do you want to possibly put yourself through it all again? The unstable nature? The paranoia of wondering is he ever going to hurt you? Even the \u201cnormal\u201d part of wondering if you\u2019re just going to just eventually break up is a concern for you. Part of you still is upset about Bobby after all.\n\nYou must have a thing for murderers at this point, because it\u2019s the only explanation to why you\u2019re contemplating all this. Maybe that whole incident with your Uncle Ed fucked you up even more than you realized.\n\nYou do have Donna\u2019s car keys. You could just leave now while Johnny sleeps.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Johnny", "result": "You can\u2019t stay with Johnny, he\u2019s obviously unstable no matter how nice he is to you. You\u2019re not going through it again.\n\nPlus you\u2019re also worried about staying here any longer than you have to since you\u2019re still paranoid that the National Guard will be sending someone here to search for their missing in action comrades.\n\nYou go back to your room and grab your bags. You start to make your way towards the living room, but then you think that perhaps maybe going out the back door would be better since you don\u2019t have to sneak past Johnny to do so.\n\nThe back door is still a wreck from today\u2019s earlier attack. When you open it up you finally see the thing that was trying to get in. Looks human enough minus the bullet holes and the slightly feral facial features. You just hope there aren\u2019t anymore currently lurking about though the nearby gunfire isn\u2019t encouraging.\n\nYou make your way through the backyard and then go around the house and finally reach Donna\u2019s car. You quickly load your bags in, worrying the whole time you\u2019re going to get attacked by one of those things or Johnny suddenly waking up and running out the front door. You get the impression he\u2019s not going to be happy to find you gone when he wakes up.\n\nYou get in the car and you actually manage to swing the car out into the street before you hear shouting and then fired upon. Despite the sounds of glass shattering behind you. You keep it together and just drive hoping that there aren\u2019t too many of the guard in front of you.\n\nIt\u2019s a false hope as you do indeed bump into more than a couple patrols with itchy trigger fingers. Some you try to avoid by going down other streets. Others are actually busy fighting off others. How you aren\u2019t hit by any that do shoot at you is something of a minor miracle, but the car certainly doesn\u2019t come through unscathed since by the time you manage to make out of Julie\u2019s neighborhood, it\u2019s making rattling sounds.\n\nYou continue to drive and try to keep off the main streets though with your car now making several clattering sounds you\u2019re not exactly keeping a low profile.\n\n\u201cJust gotta make it home. I\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d You mumble to yourself.\n\nYour drive there isn\u2019t quite as eventful as your escape from Julie\u2019s house, but it isn\u2019t without peril. The National Guard isn\u2019t quite as in control in your part of the town and there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses. Most of them don\u2019t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don\u2019t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn\u2019t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but you manage to get in the house with your bags.\n\n\u201cPETER?! Are you here?!\u201d you call out when you get in the door and dump your bags on the floor. There is no answer, but then again maybe he\u2019s already found the shelter.\n\nThe first thing you do is search the ground floor. Amazingly it doesn\u2019t look like your house has been attacked at all. Even looking out into the backyard things look fairly untouched.\n\nThen you search the connected garage and that\u2019s when you make an unexpected discovery.\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn\u2019t the disturbing part. The fact that they\u2019re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\nThe garage itself is a bit of a mess, like there was definitely a struggle, and your brother\u2019s body and the body of who you presume is his lover or client both show signs of blunt trauma. Looks like their necks were both broken to ultimately kill them though.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what to think. You feel like you should be more upset than you are, but given what an asshole he was towards you earlier and what you\u2019ve already had to experience, you\u2019re not having feelings of sorrow. You\u2019re actually more concerned with how this happened. There isn\u2019t anyone else here to your knowledge and if it had been one of those things, the bodies would probably have bite marks. You suppose it could\u2019ve been regular bandits or robbers, but you\u2019d expect gunshot or even knife wounds and neither have that.\n\nAlso if it was bandits that killed them, you wonder why they wouldn\u2019t take Peter\u2019s car since his keys are still sitting on a dresser nearby. Whether Peter was planning on leaving himself or still looking for Ben\u2019s hidden shelter (And if he found it or not) you\u2019ll never know you suppose.\n\nFeeling the fear of potential intruders in the house, you pull your pistol out and begin to search the rest of the house.\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with your pistol drawn. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn\u2019t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly\u2019s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever returned here. You get the idea to call her up, but predictably there isn\u2019t any answer. Who knows what\u2019s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn\u2019t anyone down here either. Your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\nAfter a bit more perusal of your room, you head back upstairs to secure the ground floor as much as possible. You put chairs in front of the front and back doors. (As well as the one leading to the garage)\n\nYou also move a bookcase in front of some of the windows. It\u2019s not the most fun thing to do and you bump and bang knees and elbows in the process, but it\u2019s secure enough that you\u2019re confident that if someone does try to get it, they\u2019ll make such a loud noise in the process that you\u2019ll at least wake up first.\n\nAs it starts to get darker, you decide to take your belongings to your old room in the basement where you figure you can turn on the lights without fear of someone potentially seeing them from the outside.\n\nAs you get resettled into your old room, you start to feel safer already. It\u2019s odd that you should feel that way, but then this has always been your sanctuary. You do briefly worry about Johnny and if he\u2019s going to try to track you down.\n\nWell if he does show up, you\u2019ll be ready for him. You aren\u2019t completely defenseless after all. Besides, he\u2019ll have to get through the military and those things never mind the fact that he doesn\u2019t know where you live in the first place. (At least you don\u2019t think he does)\n\nDespite that, you\u2019re going to try to remain positive. You make a plan to search for the shelter entrance in the backyard tomorrow and you figure if all else fails you can always take Peter\u2019s car and try to make it out of town.\n\nFor now though, you\u2019re going to enjoy a good night\u2019s sleep in the safety of your own room.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201cWakey wakey sis.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Your first instinct is that it\u2019s Johnny, but then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it\u2019s your sister Kelly.\n\nLooks like she\u2019s still hostile to you as well considering she\u2019s pointing a shotgun at you. You don\u2019t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at your pistol on the floor near the couch you\u2019re sleeping on and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you wouldn\u2019t make it sis. I suggest you don\u2019t even try\u2026heh I doubt you\u2019d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn\u2019t expect to glance over this way and see you sleeping here.\u201d\n\nUp? Where the hell would she come \u201cup\u201d from? You\u2019re in the basement now. Kelly\u2019s blocking your doorway, but you think you can make out a glowing light source coming from the basement floor beyond. And then it hits you.\n\n\u201c\u2026he moved the fucking shelter entrance in the house? And it\u2019s been right near my goddamn room all this time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHey hey! It\u2019s about time you used that blonde head of yours other than taking up space!\u201d Kelly mocks.\n\nWell you know where the entrance is, but unfortunately you\u2019ve got bigger issues now. Kelly pointing a shotgun at you is concerning to be sure and makes you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man\u2019s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly\u2019s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen did you find out? When you killed Peter?\u201d\n\u201cPfft. I\u2019ve always known. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I\u2019m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would\u2019ve been sleeping in the damn thing.\u201d\n\nKelly continues to address you while briefly looking over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cAs for Peter, that little faggot managed to find out where it was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn\u2019t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.\u201d\n\nKelly briefly shifts a bit in your doorway, but still holding the shotgun firmly on you of course.\n\n\u201cSo where\u2019s that little whore Donna? Heard you moved in with her. She come with you? Julie maybe? Both? How the fuck did any of you survive the week?\u201d Kelly asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m here by myself Kelly. I have no idea what happened to Donna, or Julie for that matter. I\u2026I think they\u2019re probably dead.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMmm, well you\u2019ll soon be joining them.\u201d Kelly remarks and raises the shotgun as if she\u2019s trying to get a more precise aim.\n\nTerror wells up inside you.\n\n\u201cWait! Can\u2019t you let me go? I mean I\u2019ll take Peter\u2019s car and leave! You\u2019ll never have to see me again! I mean you can\u2019t have mercy on me just this once?\u201d you exclaim and tears forming in your eyes.\n\nKelly smiles sadistically and laughs.\n\n\u201cGod, you really are as stupid as you are pathetic. You know that? If I let you leave, do you really think you could survive out there with no supplies? How long would you be able to last without resorting to trading your own ass for safety? Not long I\u2019d wager and that\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t just get raped and killed first or ripped apart by those freaks. I\u2019m doing you a favor sis.\u201d Kelly remarks.\n\nYou start to cry as you realize that this is it. You\u2019re going to die.\n\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, will you stop crying and be fucking brave for once in your life? (Sigh) Fine, you want me to show you mercy? Here.\u201d Kelly leans her shotgun against the wall nearby.\n\nAt first you think she\u2019s going to spare your life, but you soon learn it\u2019s just another sick game.\n\n\u201cOkay sis, despite my undying hatred for you, I\u2019m going to give you ONE chance just because out of all our siblings, I still think you were the one with the most potential. It\u2019s just too bad you wasted it. So, here\u2019s your second chance. Try to grab your pistol before I can grab my shotgun.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026(sniff) you\u2019re right next to your shotgun, you can grab it a lot easier than I can grab the pistol. You\u2019ll kill me before I even can reach it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo what have you got to lose? You\u2019re going to die anyway, so try to stop me.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything. You just quietly weep a bit at your situation. You thought you were safe, but how wrong you were. You really wish Johnny was here, but there\u2019s not going to be a rescue this time.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it Suzy, if you don\u2019t make a move, I\u2019m gonna just\u2026shit!\u201d\n\nYou react while Kelly is in the middle of her sentence. You scramble for the weapon and you actually manage to touch it and then a loud blast is the last thing you hear.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Stay with him", "result": "You\u2019re still not quite sure if any of this is going to lead anywhere, but fucked up or not, Johnny\u2019s still been there for you. To abandon him without even an explanation is just something you\u2019re not willing to do.\n\nBesides, if you\u2019re right about Johnny\u2019s past, having someone like that around might be necessary given how crazy things are right now. Other than pushing someone down the stairs out of panic, it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re a fighter.\n\nLooking a nearby clock on the wall, you figure it\u2019ll be getting dark in a few hours. Johnny didn\u2019t tell you when to wake him, but you figure you should give him a few extra hours after it goes dark if only so he\u2019ll be more rested. Then you\u2019ll try to convince him to just leave in Donna\u2019s car again since you still think it would be safer than trying to steal a military jeep.\n\nStill feeling a little uncomfortable about the back door windows now being broken and thus your safety more compromised, you head back into the kitchen to fix the problem. As you get close to the backdoor, you briefly see the thing still lying dead with several holes in its body and head on the back porch. Looks human, but even dead it does look a bit feral.\n\nWith great effort you manage to push the refrigerator in front of the back door. Nothing is getting in now, well at least not easily anyway.\n\nYou return to your room and check to see if your phone isn\u2019t quite as damaged, as it appeared when you threw it against the wall, but of course it is. Hardly matters, you don\u2019t have anyone to keep in contact with any more anyway.\n\nWith the gunfire still going on outside, you flop down on your couch-bed and realize that barring something trying to break in again, there\u2019s nothing to do. You re-open your laptop and lose yourself in a game because it\u2019s way better than reality right now.\n\nHours pass\u2026\n\nYou look at the time on your laptop and realize you\u2019ve been playing much longer than you intended to. You immediately get up to go wake up Johnny. It actually sounds like the gunfire has died down outside as well.\n\n\u201cHey Johnny wake up! It\u2019s time to go. I know you said you had plans to steal a jeep, but I really think we should\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen you get to the living room though, Johnny is gone. You call out to him a couple times figuring that maybe he\u2019s upstairs or even in the basement, but you get no answer.\n\nYou do see a note placed on the nearby end table in such a way that you\u2019d notice it. You almost hesitate to pick it up, but of course you do anyway.\n\nTo my dearest Suzy,\n\nI\u2019ve left to go get that jeep. I know you probably still want to use your sister\u2019s car, but I still think our best shot is with a military vehicle. I figure we can blend in a whole lot better in one of those and not look suspicious while driving around at a casual glance by soldiers. Probably better at running over those rabid people too. We might even be able to get out of this forsaken town.\n\nAnyway, I left this note since I didn\u2019t want to disturb you or cause any unpleasant arguments on this matter.\n\nI also know you didn\u2019t leave while I slept, even though you could have. This means so much to me, I don\u2019t think you know how much.\n\nI know I haven\u2019t exactly given you much reason to not be distrustful of me, but the very fact that you didn\u2019t leave tells me that you believe in me on some level. You know I\u2019ll try to come through for you and that you\u2019re willing to wait.\n\nI knew when I first heard your drunken whore of a sister talk about you; I thought you sounded like you were the one.\n\nThen when I saw and spoke with you, I was sure of it.\n\nI will come back tonight as planned, however if the situation becomes dangerous over there, then by all means escape in your sister\u2019s car. It would never be my wish for you to stay in danger.\n\nForever my love,\nJohnny\n\nWhen the hell did he leave and write this? And how did you not hear him? He wasn\u2019t joking about being stealthy you guess.\n\nOf course you probably would have known all this a lot sooner had you not got wrapped up in your game and actually left your room.\n\nAs for the note itself, well\u2026it\u2019s standard Johnny in the short term you\u2019ve known him. The \u201cwhore\u201d description of your sister is a bit of a standout from the rest of letter which is fairly white knightish.\n\nOf course you know damn well Johnny is far from being a \u201cwhite knight\u201d.\n\nSuddenly you hear the basement door opening. You tense up in fear since you\u2019ve left not only the car keys but also your pistol in your room. You think at first you\u2019re going to have to risk just running out the front door, but\u2026\n\n\u201cHey Suzy! Suzy? I got the jeep, come on let\u2019s get ready to go!\u201d you hear Johnny\u2019s voice call out.\n\nYou cautiously walk towards the hallway and see Johnny standing there looking into your room, then he turns his head and sees you. He\u2019s got some clothing in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh there you are. I was worried for a moment that you had to run out in a hurry!\u201d\n\u201cJohnny, what the hell\u2026didn\u2019t you hear me calling you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, I just got here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? How? I\u2019ve been in the living room for the past few minutes! You couldn\u2019t have gotten by me.\u201d\n\u201cNo I came in through the basement window. I couldn\u2019t just leave the front door unlocked when I left.\u201d\n\u201cBasement win\u2026wait I didn\u2019t hear any glass breaking.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not broken. I had it so I could easily open it. Don\u2019t worry, I thought about your safety. That window is pretty well hidden and not exactly easy to crawl through so I didn\u2019t think any of those things would see it. They would\u2019ve been more likely to just try to bash the ground floor doors or windows in.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you mess around with the basement window and why didn\u2019t you just tell me you were leaving?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you get my note? I explained why I left with bothering you in it.\u201d\n\u201cI only just finished reading it this minute.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well I assumed you would\u2019ve left your room before now. Anyway, here I got you these to wear. I think they might be a bit baggy, but they should work to help us blend in more.\u201d\n\nJohnny shoves the clothing at you as if to distract you from asking more questions. It\u2019s a uniform like what Johnny is wearing.\n\nYou almost ask Johnny how he got the uniform, but as with most things concerning Johnny you\u2019re starting to think it might better if you don\u2019t know.\n\nAs far as the basement window weirdness, you\u2019re not going to dwell on it too much because it\u2019s really not important right now.\n\n\u201cAlright, that sounds like a good idea, I\u2019ll go put these on.\u201d You say and go to your room.\n\u201cUm, don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t get those from a dead person or anything. It was a spare one I found.\u201d Johnny blurts out.\n\u201cOkay. I trust you Johnny.\u201d You say which seems to make him smile.\n\nYou lock the door and change into the military fatigues. Granted you don\u2019t see any blood or tears in the fatigues, but then he could\u2019ve just choked the person wearing it to death.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Suzy, why the hell are you attracted to this guy? Oh right, because you\u2019ve got some serious psychological issues yourself, that\u2019s why.\u201d You mumble to yourself as if being painfully aware of the situation makes everything okay.\n\nYou grab your bags and exit your room.\n\n\u201cGlad to see the fatigues aren\u2019t excessively big on you, I know you\u2019re small framed and all. You ready to go?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get out of this place. How is it out there?\u201d\n\u201cIn our immediate area? It\u2019s fairly quiet now. Haven\u2019t seen any of the rabid and the remainder of the Guard is busy burning bodies right now. I mean there are still patrols, but nobody even batted an eye when I drove this thing up to the house. Probably assumed whoever was inside was investigating or something. We shouldn\u2019t linger here though.\u201d\n\nWith both of you ready and as prepared as you\u2019re going to be, you and Johnny exit out the front door and quickly enter the jeep which is sitting right next to your sister\u2019s car. You have to admit, you do feel a little safer sitting in this thing than if you did in your sister\u2019s car.\n\nJohnny starts up the vehicle and turns to you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you know I\u2019ll take you anywhere you want to go. So is there any place you had in mind?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u2018Never been anywhere, so not really.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI remember you saying you wanted to go home before.\u201d\n\u201cWell that would be nice, but things aren\u2019t exactly normal any more. I mean the only reason for going back there would be to look for my brother\u2019s bomb shelter, which definitely would be a safe zone knowing how Ben spent so much time building and constantly modifying it. Of course my other brother Peter is currently looking for it as well and who knows if he already claimed and locked himself inside it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well it might be worth a look if you still want to try it. I mean the only other logical option I can think of is to as I suggested, leave town altogether. Should be much easier while driving around in this thing. Of course it might still be risky, if they\u2019ve set up some sort of checkpoints outside of town\u2026but maybe we can get the edge by fooling them briefly before smashing through such things.\u201d\n\nPretty risky stuff, but then these are risky times.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go home", "result": "It might be wishful thinking on your part, but you desire to be able to go home and stay there is a lot stronger than trying to find some place new. In fact it seems like every time you try something new, it turns into a clusterfuck.\n\n\u201cI want to go home and give it one more chance. If it turns out staying there isn\u2019t a viable option, then I suppose we can leave town.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, but you\u2019ll have to give me directions.\u201d Johnny says and starts pulling out of the driveway.\n\nYou pass by a few soldiers dragging a few more bodies and placing them in a large pile outside one of the homes in this area. Another large pile of bodies is burning outside yet another home. Nobody tries to flag you down or anything though, you\u2019re guessing that between the dark, the uniforms and the jeep, if anyone is actually paying attention to you driving through, they probably think you\u2019re just more soldiers patrolling around. It isn\u2019t like this is most stable of situations right now.\n\nYou continue to tell Johnny where to turn and drive and you go through another area where the National Guard has a presence. Again, you have no problems for the most part. However you then start hitting areas that are still suffering from conflict and in those cases, pretty severely. This is where some soldiers notice you a lot more and try to call out to you, presumably for help.\n\nIn one case, you see two soldiers ragged and bloody running desperately from several of those rabid people. They cry out for you to stop, but naturally you and Johnny just keep driving. You hear some faint curses and screams as you put distance between you and the unfortunate soldiers.\n\nYou eventually drive through areas that have been completely overrun by rabid. In fact you find that the military doesn\u2019t actually have that much control at all over your town and that there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses. Most of them don\u2019t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don\u2019t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn\u2019t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but fortunately that isn\u2019t the case and you manage get in the house as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t see shit, but I\u2019m sort of afraid to turn on a light.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cI know what you mean. Wouldn\u2019t want to attract those things. I got a small flashlight on this rifle. It shouldn\u2019t be too noticeable from the outside. So what\u2019s the deal with this shelter your brother built?\u201d Johhny says turning on the flashlight and briefly shining it around the room and the nearby room.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I mean all I know is the entrance is hidden and that Peter was looking for it. In fact, I\u2019m wondering if he already found it and locked himself up in it. Seems like he would\u2019ve heard us.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been that noisy. Besides, maybe he thinks we\u2019re intruders and is laying in wait to ambush us.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly. I\u2019d call out his name, but again, I don\u2019t want to make more noise\u2026ah to hell with it. PETER?! Are you here?!\u201d you said in a raised voice, trying not to shout too loudly.\n\nThere is no answer.\n\n\u201cHe could be down in the basement or upstairs.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cMaybe, I still think he would\u2019ve heard me though\u2026let\u2019s go check his room. If he did find out something about the shelter, maybe there will at least be a clue there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s his room?\u201d\n\u201cThe connected garage. It\u2019s near the kitchen up ahead.\u201d\n\nYou cautiously move about in the dark with Johnny taking the lead. You\u2019re holding on to your pistol the whole time being paranoid about something attacking you in the darkness. Johnny slowly opens the door to the garage and shines his light inside\u2026\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn\u2019t the disturbing part. The fact that they\u2019re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s Peter.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the other guy?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cDunno. Probably a client or boyfriend or something. He said he was with someone when I spoke earlier today with him.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, looks like there was a struggle. This place is obviously a mess.\u201d Johnny says shining the light all over the room.\n\nHe shines the light on Peter and the other man and then gets a closer look.\n\n\u201cHmm, looks like they both suffered quite a bit of blunt trauma before their necks got snapped. It certainly wasn\u2019t those rabid people that did this. I\u2019d wager if it was, they\u2019d have chunks bitten out of them. Bandits perhaps, but this house doesn\u2019t look ransacked.\u201d\n\nYou stand there in silence as Johnny goes on about who could\u2019ve possibly done this.\n\n\u201cSuzy? You okay?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah. It\u2019s just\u2026well sort of weird. I was pissed at Peter for the bullshit he said on the phone. Seeing him dead like this\u2026is well\u2026I dunno. I feel like I should feel something, but I don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m becoming desensitized or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, like you said, he was an asshole to you earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he was. In fact I think part of the reason why I came here was the hope that he hadn\u2019t locked himself inside the shelter yet, so I could yell at him in person and maybe even kick his ass. (Sigh) Guess that isn\u2019t necessary anymore. Also don\u2019t know if he actually found the shelter or not and now I\u2019m paranoid that whoever killed him is still in this fucking house.\u201d\n\u201cWe can find out the latter pretty quickly I should think, we can just make a quick search. As for the former, well that\u2019s up to you really.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night, you\u2019re in a town full of trigger happy military and cannibalistic crazies, you\u2019ve just found your brother and his lover dead in the garage, you\u2019re hanging around a guy who is unhealthily obsessed with you and to top it all of, you\u2019re getting tired.\n\nAt this point you don\u2019t want to risk anymore travelling.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s do what you said and check the house out. If everything is safe, let\u2019s just camp here for the rest of the night and start looking for the shelter tomorrow with fresh eyes.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Johnny answers.\n\nFirst thing you do is finish checking out the ground floor. Everything turns out okay and fairly untouched. Even the backyard doesn\u2019t have any nasty unwanted lurkers in it either. (As added protection you and Johnny shove a few chairs in front of the back and front doors just in case any DO show up)\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with Johnny. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn\u2019t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly\u2019s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever returned here. Who knows what\u2019s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn\u2019t anyone down here either. Not worrying about someone seeing a light source down here you turn the lights on and find your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026this is where you lived huh?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cYep. This was my lot in life. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was mine. I was happy here you know? (Sigh) If only things never changed\u2026Hm. Just realized you\u2019re the first person other than myself that\u2019s been in here in a long time.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat about your boyfriend?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cBobby? Not as much as you might think. We actually hung out upstairs when nobody else was really around or over his house as unpleasant as that could be at times. Honestly I sort of preferred that nobody come in here except me. This was my haven from the outside world and wanted to maintain that illusion as much as possible. Funny, but even with all the chaos going on out there, I still feel very safe here. Anyway, I guess nobody is lurking in the house.\u201d\n\u201cGuess not. Either that or they\u2019re very sneaky. So are you going to be sleeping down here then?\u201d\n\u201cI believe I will. I figure even if we can\u2019t find the shelter tomorrow, I will have at least gotten to sleep one last time in my own room before we leave.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll find it. In fact maybe I\u2019ll do a little searching while you\u2019re resting.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well good luck with that. I know it seems like an easy task since the backyard is only so big, but somehow Ben managed to hide it pretty well. Only his son Tommy used to consistently know where it was located and moved. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t want you to suddenly drawing a pack of those rabid things due to you shining a flashlight around outside. Even if there is a privacy fence around the back.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes, I imagine you would be\u2026Johnny\u2026you weren\u2019t in the military yourself at one time were you?\u201d\n\u201cNah. Following orders, regimented life, not really my thing. Had enough of that growing up with my mom. Why?\u201d\n\u201cJust wondering. Due to all the shit that\u2019s been going on, we also haven\u2019t had much time to talk. I still don\u2019t know that much about you.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well you know. Like I mentioned a few times, I\u2019ve been a bit of a drifter. Nothing really exciting though, it\u2019s just the way things have turned out for me.\u201d\n\nJohnny starts shifting his body a bit. He\u2019s trying not to look nervous about you asking deeper questions about his past, but you can tell by now when he\u2019s being evasive.\n\n\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m gonna leave you to your haven as you called it. If anything urgent comes up I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nJohnny turns and starts to leave then he stops to turn back to you.\n\n\u201cYou know I love you right?\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2026 know Johnny\u2026and we\u2019ll talk about that tomorrow as well.\u201d\n\nJohnny doesn\u2019t reply, he just turns around and heads upstairs.\n\nWell barring any unforeseen problems you\u2019ve got two big issues to tackle tomorrow. The shelter location and Johnny.\n\nBut those are issues to deal with tomorrow. Right now you\u2019re going to pretend that none of the shit that\u2019s currently happening is actually happening and enjoy your haven, if only tonight.", "action_results": [{"action": "The next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\u201cWakey wakey sis.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it\u2019s your sister Kelly.\n\nLooks like she\u2019s still hostile to you as well considering she\u2019s pointing a shotgun at you. You don\u2019t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at your pistol on the floor near the couch you\u2019re sleeping on and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you wouldn\u2019t make it sis. I suggest you don\u2019t even try\u2026heh I doubt you\u2019d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn\u2019t expect to glance over this way and see you sleeping here.\u201d\n\nUp? Where the hell would she come \u201cup\u201d from? You\u2019re in the basement now. Kelly\u2019s blocking your doorway, but you think you can make out a glowing light source coming from the basement floor beyond. And then it hits you.\n\n\u201c\u2026he moved the fucking shelter entrance in the house? And it\u2019s been right near my goddamn room all this time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHey hey! It\u2019s about time you used that blonde head of yours other than taking up space!\u201d Kelly mocks.\n\nWell you know where the entrance is, but unfortunately you\u2019ve got bigger issues now. Kelly pointing a shotgun at you is concerning to be sure and makes you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man\u2019s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly\u2019s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen did you find out? When you killed Peter?\u201d\n\u201cPfft. I\u2019ve always known. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I\u2019m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would\u2019ve been sleeping in the damn thing.\u201d\n\nKelly continues to address you while briefly looking over her shoulder. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s just being cautious or if she knows someone else is with you\u2026and where is Johnny anyway?\n\n\u201cAs for Peter, that little faggot managed to find out where it was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn\u2019t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.\u201d\n\nKelly briefly moves a bit to her left in your doorway allowing you to briefly look to see if you see Johnny coming, but you see nobody. Kelly notices you looking though.\n\n\u201cSo where\u2019s that little whore Donna? Heard you moved in with her. She come with you? Julie maybe? Both? How the fuck did any of you survive the week?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here by myself Kelly.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. SOMEONE is here with you. I can\u2019t see a shrinking violet like you hauling your ass through a bunch of military patrols as well as those freaks. The fact that you\u2019re wearing military fatigues tells me that SOMEONE helped you. I know damn well you didn\u2019t kill someone yourself for them.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a weird week Kelly. You never know what you\u2019re capable of until you\u2019re put into the situation.\u201d You say in such a way that gives Kelly a bit of an eyebrow raise.\n\n\u201cOh? So\u2026are you a killer now, little sister? Tell me, how did it feel when you did it?\u201d\n\u201cI threw up. I\u2019m not a fucking psychopath okay?! It didn\u2019t give me some thrill! I just did what I had to, to survive!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cOkay, okay, calm down there killer.\u201d Kelly chuckles before getting serious again.\n\n\u201cWhile this is enlightening and all, we really should be getting back to the matter at hand.\u201d\n\nStill no sign of Johnny. Where the fuck is he?\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s next Kelly? You gonna kill me too?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know sis\u2026don\u2019t know\u2026severely thinking about it. I\u2019ve never liked you. You\u2019ve been a thorn in my side since you crawled out of mom\u2019s vagina. Always having to be compared to how good and pretty you were and how bad and rotten I was despite the fact I was the one who was shouldering most of the responsibility in this fucked up family. What did you ever do except hide in the goddamn basement? Even now you left the house only to come crawling back here. Yep, I\u2019ve thought about killing you on many, many, MANY occasions.\u201d\n\u201cActually that wasn\u2019t my initial intention. My initial plan was to drive out of this forsaken town. I only stopped here because my own vehicle was badly damaged and I had hoped to maybe get Peter\u2019s car and some extra supplies before heading out again.\u201d You say trying to stall for time.\n\u201cOh? Hmm, you\u2019re just full of surprises today aren\u2019t you? Well if that is true, you may have just bought yourself a bit of a reprieve sis\u2026okay. What the hell, I\u2019m in a good mood. I\u2019m gonna let you walk outta here alive and you\u2019re going to be thankful.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll allow me to gather some supplies or let me have my gun will you?\u201d\n\u201cHah, no. Wouldn\u2019t want you getting any ideas of trying to shoot me, you being a killer now and all. In fact let me just take that pistol right now. Stay on that couch and keep lying in that prone position. Don\u2019t you fucking move, or boom there goes your pretty little blonde head all over the place.\u201d\n\nJohnny is still nowhere to be seen. Did he take off? Did you actually get abandoned by a fucking stalker? Is your luck really that bad?\n\nKelly now moves into your room, still pointing the shotgun at you, As she\u2019s crouching down to pick up the pistol, there is a brief moment that she takes her eyes off of you.\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that there will be no rescue; the only thing you can hope is that Kelly is going to keep her word and let you go unharmed. Of course you don\u2019t really think that\u2019s likely and part of you wants to grab for the pistol before she can.", "action_results": [{"action": "Grab the pistol", "result": "In an act of desperation you lunge for the pistol, but Kelly easily anticipates your actions. She quickly grabs the weapon and manages to step on your hand in the process followed by her smashing the pistol into your head.\n\n\u201cYou dumb blonde bitch, I was gonna let you go too! What the\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat occurs next is a blur mainly because you\u2019re still dizzy from getting hit in the head, but also because it happens so fast.\n\nJohnny bursts out of the closet with his rifle in hand, but Kelly already has a grip on you and managed to pull you up in an attempt to use you as a human shield.\n\nJohnny and Kelly scream at each other. Something about letting you go and something else about blowing your head off. Eventually it doesn\u2019t matter because Johnny eventually feels he has no choice and if you\u2019re going to get killed, then it should be him that does it.\n\nJohnny opens fire on you both, before Kelly can make good on her threats of killing you. Due to you soaking up several of the initial bullets, she actually manages to get off a couple of shots at Johnny, but whether she got him or not is irrelevant because you\u2019re still lying dead on top of Kelly\u2019s equally bullet ridden body.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Don\u2019t move", "result": "It\u2019s no good. You\u2019d never manage to grab the pistol before Kelly. Even if you did, she\u2019d probably manage to shoot you before you could shoot her. Fear and panic begins to well up inside you as you believe this is the beginning of the end.\n\nKelly picks up the pistol and smiles as she puts it in front of her pants. You look helplessly as she does this\u2026and then that\u2019s when your eyes wander to your closet.\n\nYou don\u2019t remember shutting the closet door. In fact you never shut your closet door\u2026\n\nAnd it\u2019s opening right now.\n\nInstinctively you try to flatten your body and disappear into the crevasse of your couch as much as possible. You then place your arms up to your face.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? That\u2019s not gonna\u2026\u201d Kelly starts to say and then she hears a creak.\n\nJohnny unloads several rounds into Kelly\u2019s body and head. She doesn\u2019t even have time to fully turn around. Pieces of her fly out from the exit wounds and she falls to the floor in a bloody mess still twitching a bit.\n\n\u201cShit. Shit. Oh Shit. Oh fuck. Fuck. Please oh God. Please.\u201d You\u2019re muttering to yourself the whole time, barely aware of everything else.\n\nJohnny walks over from the closet and kneels over to you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over Suzy. Calm down. It\u2019s over. She\u2019s dead. That bitch will never bully you again.\u201d Johnny says grabbing one of your hands.\n\nYou calm down and look at Johnny. In that moment you don\u2019t care about what he has done in the past or what he might do in the future. All you care about is that he was ultimately there for you when it counted.\n\nYou sit up and hug him, getting teary eyed in the process.\n\n\u201cOh god, I thought\u2026I thought maybe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was always there to protect you. I told you. I\u2019ll always be here. You\u2019re my perfect angel. You give my life\u2026purpose.\u201d Johnny replies hugging you in return and patting you on the back.\n\nJohnny also sniffs your hair as he\u2019s hugging you at which point causes you to pull back a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. I just\u2026\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know. It was the moment.\u201d You say trying not to make it too uncomfortable.\n\nWith you and Johnny done embracing, you stand up and look over at your sister\u2019s body, which has stopped any sort of death twitch it might\u2019ve briefly had.\n\nYou just stare at it silently. Johnny doesn\u2019t even speak, he instead watches you looking at your sister. After about a couple of minutes of this, he finally speaks.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly? I feel nothing. I don\u2019t feel anger for what she did. I don\u2019t feel guilt or even happiness that she\u2019s dead. I just don\u2019t feel anything for her anymore. She\u2019s dead and that\u2019s it. Just like Peter upstairs. Just like my Mom, my Dad, my whole family at this point. They\u2019re all dead and I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know about your sister Donna.\u201d Johnny remarks.\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead too. I know she is.\u201d You say and look at Johnny who looks away and focuses back on Kelly\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cWell anyway, it looks like we know where the shelter entrance is now. Why don\u2019t we check it out?\u201d\n\u201cWell that was the whole goal of this ordeal I suppose.\u201d You say.\n\nJohnny exits the room and you grab your pistol back from Kelly\u2019s body before leaving. Stepping out of your room you see the hatch in the floor wide open where the fluorescent glow of lighting coming from.\n\nYou take a look inside and see a long ladder down leading to another floor, which you imagine that\u2019s the main shelter. You can\u2019t believe how close it was to your room and how you never knew about it!\n\n\u201cHow the hell did you brother do this with you hearing or knowing about it?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cI dunno. I mean he managed to routinely change the entrance all the damn time too. Ben had a gift I guess. Everyone does I suppose.\u201d you say and you and Johnny start climbing down the ladder and you close up the hatch.\n\nEventually you get to the bottom and you and Johnny open up a metal door, which is fortunately not locked.\n\nAnd there it is, you\u2019re in the shelter proper. Before you is a dimly lit living area with various furniture and even a TV. Other rooms include a bathroom, kitchen area, a couple of bedrooms and A LOT of storage rooms. One such room is huge, as rows and rows of canned food and bottled water are found.\n\n\u201cWell looks like sustenance is plentiful. Doesn\u2019t even look like Kelly put a dent in the supplies.\u201d You say.\n\nAnother storage room contains a goodly amount of ammo and weapons of all kinds. Mostly rifles. Medical supplies are in another.\n\nOne thing that stands out is that Ben\u2019s shelter has solid steel walls. You have no idea how the hell he did this and you guess you never will. You do notice on several of the walls something has been repeatedly scratched out though not entirely successfully everywhere.\n\nAt one point you make out most of it.\n\nPr-p---- o- th- Gr--n- -er- Cor---at-o-\n\n\u201cWell, I guess spending thousands on one of those Ground Zero shelters would\u2019ve been a waste of money for you Seems like you got a nice one for free.\u201d Johnny says looking around.\n\u201cIndeed. Now we need to talk about us Johnny.\u201d\n\nJohnny turns to you and sees you\u2019re holding your pistol directly at him. He doesn\u2019t react with surprise or anger or anything. It\u2019s nothing.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the \u201creal\u201d Johnny right there. The one you\u2019ve always known even when you weren\u2019t quite sure.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026what is this Suzy?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I really don\u2019t. I wish I did. I wish I could make a decision. I wish I could be the killer my sister thought I was. This would be so much easier. On the other hand I also wish I could trust and just let go.\u201d\n\nJohnny makes no move towards you. He just continues to stand there. You briefly wipe your eyes while still holding the pistol on him.\n\n\u201cJohnny, you\u2019ve been here for me this whole crazy week. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve survived if you hadn\u2019t been around\u2026but I know you. I know what you are.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought that you wouldn\u2019t figure it out, you\u2019re an intelligent woman after all which is matched only by your beauty of course.\u201d Johnny replies.\n\u201cStop. Just stop.\u201d You exclaim.\n\nYou tear up and sniffle for a moment and then address Johnny again.\n\n\u201cMy uncle Ed was a serial killer. We all sort of wondered, but it wasn\u2019t until that fateful day when I decided to go snooping around where I shouldn\u2019t have that I learned the awful truth. He caught me finding where he was storing body parts, but in his own twisted honorable way due to being related, he said he\u2019d spare my life if I helped him kill someone. Kept saying I was pure and good, and not like the rest of those whores he killed.\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s eyebrows raise when you say this. Now he seems genuinely surprised.\n\n\u201cIn a more fucked up twist, he was feuding with a group of cultists into human sacrifice. Wanted me to help kill them. I initially did out of fear, but then I met Bobby during this mission. I ended up betraying my uncle because I felt that connection to Bobby because we both came from fucked up families. I thought it was love, and maybe it was, but it didn\u2019t last obviously.\u201d\n\nJohnny seems a bit overwhelmed by your new information.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 some story Suzy. I have to admit, I never would have guessed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat what? That I\u2019m not perfect? I\u2019m not good? I\u2019m not so pure? That I\u2019m a backstabbing whore like all the rest?\u201d you snap.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026that wasn\u2019t what I was going to say at all. Suzy, do you really think I could ever see you in that light?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know Johnny. You\u2019ve never told me much about your past. I mean I can piece things together by what you have told me and how you\u2019ve acted. And that\u2019s the problem I DON\u2019T KNOW.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Suzy, let\u2019s just get it completely out in the open. What exactly is it that you think I\u2019ve done or what I am?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a serial killer. I mean I don\u2019t exactly know just how bad you are for certain and I can\u2019t know for certain, but I do know you\u2019re a killer. I\u2019ve been studying you probably just as much as you\u2019ve been studying me. I mean\u2026Christ\u2026I don\u2019t KNOW if you killed Donna. I don\u2019t KNOW if you killed Julie, but the more I think about it and how they just disappeared and the conclusion I come to isn\u2019t pleasant. There\u2019s also your own suspicious behavior, the incident with the soldier \u201cfalling\u201d down the stairs, your rage when beating that guy\u2019s head in, claiming that you\u2019ve done bad things, stealing a jeep and most likely killing the owners in process, and finally your obsession with me. I\u2019m quite familiar with your kind enough that even if I can\u2019t prove some of this shit, I feel it in my heart that\u2019s what you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026if I am so terrible, then I suppose you should kill me.\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn it Johnny, if it was THAT FUCKING EASY I WOULD! But YOU KNOW it isn\u2019t and I KNOW it isn\u2019t! Because I also know underneath the fucked up social chameleon predator, I KNOW there actually IS a human being capable of love. I believe you really love me Johnny. I do. I don\u2019t doubt it. The problem is, how can I fucking trust that it\u2019s going to last?\u201d\n\nJohnny has no answer. He just looks down.\n\n\u201cWell see there\u2019s my problem. How do I know that I\u2019m not going to do something that\u2019s going to set you off? Make you see me as fallen angel or a flawed person that is fit only for destruction? And this goes both ways Johnny, how do YOU know that I might not strike first? Granted I\u2019m not a killer, but I still manipulated events to cause the death of my uncle. Can YOU really trust me, if I\u2019m scared of you?\u201d you say.\n\nJohnny at this point rubs his eyes and sniffles a bit. He\u2019s not exactly crying, but he\u2019s definitely having an emotional moment.\n\n\u201cSuzy. I cannot think of anything more that I can do, that would convince you that I\u2019ll love you forever and that I will always protect you. It\u2019s true I have done bad things\u2026it\u2019s also true that I probably would be classified as a serial killer. I\u2019m very sick Suzy. I have a lot of bad thoughts going on in my head most of the time and even though I can emulate emotions, they don\u2019t feel genuine. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just a mask. But with you, it\u2019s different. I haven\u2019t felt this way towards anyone since\u2026well my first love. I don\u2019t really want to get into that right now, but I want to say it was a much different situation.\u201d\n\nJohnny falls to his knees.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything I felt during my time with you this week was actually real to me. You made me feel like a normal person. Like I had at last found a purpose to my life. I love you Suzy. You can never fall off that pedestal. I know that this is difficult for you. I understand the alienation and mistrust you feel, perhaps in a different way, but I understand it. But I also know that you want to give us a chance, if you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be struggling with this right now.\u201d\n\nYou continue to point the pistol at Johnny as more tears roll down your cheeks.\n\n\u201cJohnny\u2026I know you\u2019ve lied to me or been evasive about things this week. I\u2019ve been nothing but truthful. If this has any chance of working. I need to know right now. (Exhale) Did you kill Donna and Julie?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t care what happened to them and that they abandoned you.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cAnd that may be the case because you FUCKING killed them! Now stop evading the fucking question and answer it!\u201d you demand.\n\nJohnny looks at you. In fact it\u2019s the most cold-blooded stare you\u2019ve ever seen from him. It\u2019s like when Uncle Ed looked at you in his van.\n\n\u201cWould you believe me, if I said no?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cANSWER!\u201d you demand.\n\u201cVery well. No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Johnny says looking straight at you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept the answer", "result": "And with those words that you hear from Johnny, everything in your mind just sort of shuts off.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. None of it does. You see that now.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You say and put your pistol away.\n\nJohnny looks a bit uncertain, almost as if he was expecting you to shoot him.\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah, okay. If you\u2019re telling me you didn\u2019t kill them, then you didn\u2019t kill them. In fact I don\u2019t want to know about your past either. It\u2019s just not important. You were there for me this week when nobody else was, that\u2019s the important thing and that\u2019s what I should place my faith in.\u201d\n\nJohnny slowly gets up off his knees. He doesn\u2019t approach you right away; instead he just continues to stand at a distance.\n\n\u201cI apologize for my earlier outburst Johnny. I just, well it\u2019s been a stressful week. You understand.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah\u2026.yeah I get it. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cGood. Good. Well, let\u2019s move on to other matters shall we?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nSuddenly Johnny rushes at you and grabs you tightly. While one arm is firmly around your waist, one hand moves up to your neck and you feel a gentle squeeze as he looks into your eyes. It\u2019s the look of a predator that has finally caught his prey.\n\n\u201cWell? What are you waiting for lover? I trust you.\u201d you say not resisting.\n\nJohnny\u2019s hand moves from your neck and to your face, where upon he strokes your cheek gently.\n\n\u201cYou have the face of a perfect angel.\u201d he whispers and then he moves in to kiss you.\n\nAs your lips touch, he begins to take your clothes off in a hasty fashion. He\u2019s definitely getting aggressive, but oddly you\u2019re not quite feeling his \u201centhusiasm\u201d yet\u2026\n\nBy the time you get pushed over towards the bed and are basically in your bra and panties, he still isn\u2019t quite \u201cready.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need some help?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine...\u201d He says as he tries to get it up.\n\nWhile you take off the remainder of your clothes Johnny\u2019s still having difficulties.\n\n\u201cLook I can help you out, I don\u2019t mind going down on\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShhh! No! I don\u2019t want you debasing yourself like a whore! I just need to focus!\u201d Johnny snaps.\n\u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d You say and back off.\n\nYou lie down on the bed and try not to stare in an effort to not look judgmental. This is really awkward though.\n\nJohnny starts swearing, as his buddy is not doing what he wants it to do. Swearing turns to shouting and then finally a complete breakdown.\n\n\u201cShit! I wanted this to be so perfect. I wanted to be everything for you, not some fucking impotent eunuch!\u201d he says sniffling a bit.\n\n\u201cHey, calm down. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re trying too hard, you just need to relax.\u201d You say moving over to caress him a bit.\n\u201cI know. (sniffle) This just has never happened before.\u201d Johnny replies.\n\u201cWell, you probably aren\u2019t used to\u2026uh situations like this. I mean would it help if I pretended I was dead or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. That doesn\u2019t work. Your body is too warm and submerging you in cold water would be really uncomfortable for you.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nAs you continue to try to make Johnny feel more at ease, he slowly speaks.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026there is something I can think of\u2026but\u2026you\u2019re not going to want to do it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDoes it involve pain?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen go ahead and say it.\u201d\n\u201cCould\u2026could you pretend that we\u2019re related?\u201d Johnny asks.\n\nWhy are you not surprised?\n\n\u201cAh. I see. So you want me to role play as your mother?\u201d you ask going for the obvious serial killer obsession.\n\u201cHah, no. You\u2019re a bit too young for that, I don\u2019t think I could maintain the illusion, but\u2026 um maybe you could be my sister?\u201d\n\nWow, a murderous boyfriend who fucked his sister in the past, it\u2019s like being with Bobby all over again\u2026and there\u2019s something vaguely comforting about that. You always did prefer something familiar to something new.\n\nYou smile and caress Johnny\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cOf course brother dear.\u201d You say and passionately kiss Johnny.\n\nFrom there things get a lot better. Johnny actually is a pretty sensual lover when he gets going. You guess he must\u2019ve loved his sister just like you once loved Bobby a lot.\n\nJohnny falls asleep shortly afterwards professing his usual love for you. After being awake a little longer yourself thinking about what the future might hold, you go to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the faint sounds of rustling. You look up from your bed and see Johnny getting dressed.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d you ask groggily.\n\u201cI was going to get the stuff I brought in from the jeep and left up stairs on Thursday night. I know we\u2019ve got more than enough stuff down here now, but I still thought you\u2019d want your clothes which we don\u2019t have any of down here.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Okay, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, stay here and relax, I got it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay really, I don\u2019t mind. Besides, I still left things in my room that I\u2019d like to get.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure you want to do that with your sister\u2019s body still in there?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah that\u2019s right. Well I\u2019ll just help you with the bags from upstairs then.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Always enjoy your company anyway and don\u2019t worry, I fully intend on cleaning up all the bodies upstairs, not just your sister\u2019s. I mean know we\u2019re going to be down here for a while, but you never want bodies just lying around to rot in your area. Never mind the smell, but there are also vermin and health hazards to consider.\u201d Johnny says.\n\nWell he\u2019d probably know better than most\u2026\n\nYou and Johnny finish getting dressed and exit the shelter. From the basement you then head to the ground floor where you see your bags lying on the floor near the front door.\n\n\u201cYou said you brought these in on Thursday night?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, after you fell asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s a silly question since you never seem to be scared of anything, but you weren\u2019t concerned about those rabid things possibly wandering around at night?\u201d\n\u201cOh I definitely was prepared in case of an attack, but the strange thing is, its dead silent in your neighborhood. Or at least it seems like it is. I didn\u2019t see anything wandering around out there. Rabid or otherwise. If I had to guess, the National Guard exterminated everything in this area and moved on.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well from what I\u2019ve seen they\u2019re getting their ass kicked elsewhere. I just hope that\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you or Johnny can say anything else a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can\u2019t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n\u201c\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026I have to say, I\u2019m not entirely surprised. Johnny replies looking with you.\n\u201cFrom the direction I saw the cloud, I\u2019d say it probably hit Security City and that\u2019s fairly far away. I know impact should\u2019ve at least shattered the windows of the house had it been closer or bigger so it probably wasn\u2019t even a large one. Still, we probably should still get down in that shelter.\u201d You say.\n\nJohnny agrees and the pair of you grab all the bags and quickly head back down to the shelter.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s a good thing we decided to come back here instead of trying to leave town.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I imagine things are going to be quite chaotic for a long time to come. It\u2019s better that you\u2019re safe down here.\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re both safe down here.\u201d you say, but Johnny\u2019s pacing suggests that he\u2019s a bit preoccupied.\n\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, with this new event come to light, its already established that the situation just got a lot worse and isn\u2019t going to be ending anytime soon. Now we\u2019ve probably got a decades worth of supplies, possibly a little more since I don\u2019t eat much anyway, but the fact remains, we\u2019re going to need more supplies eventually and that means going up to the surface and dealing with it.\u201d Johnny replies.\n\u201cYeah, I know. I didn\u2019t really want to think about it, but you\u2019re right of course. I think I saw some survival manuals in one of the rooms down here, guess I better read up on them.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I certainly wouldn\u2019t stop you from getting yourself acquainted with such things, my thoughts are, why do you need to leave here and risk your life at all? I\u2019ll be the one going up there.\u201d\n\u201cWell we are sort of a team now right? I mean don\u2019t you want me to help you?\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s hands touch your shoulders as he stares into your eyes. His hands gently run down from your shoulders to your arms until he\u2019s holding both of your hands.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you were too good for this world when it wasn\u2019t completely fucked up, you\u2019re definitely too good for it now. As dangerous as it was in this past week, it\u2019s going to be ten times worse now. It\u2019s going to be chaos, anarchy and people killing each other for survival as well as pleasure. In short, it\u2019s going to be a world that someone like me would thrive in. I actually belong out there.\u201d\n\nJohnny then lets go your hands and raises his arms upward and looks up and around making motions with his hands pointing to the shelter in general.\n\n\u201cAnd this, all this, is your world. This is all you have ever needed Suzy. Some place to feel safe. Some place locked away from the outside world. I mean you\u2019re the honest one here, can you tell me sincerely that you really want to go out there scrounging around for supplies and having to deal with people wanting to rape you or kill you, or hell even eat you? Wouldn\u2019t you rather someone else deal with it?\u201d\n\nJohnny focuses his attention back to you. You look at him and you don\u2019t even answer because your face is probably giving him his answer already. He\u2019s absolutely right.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to deal with reality. You never have. In fact you got along pretty well without having to for a very long time and whenever you have had to deal with it, it\u2019s always been a stressful mess. He\u2019s also right in that he\u2019s far more suited to dealing with the shitstorm that the surface is going to be.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s just one more reason why you didn\u2019t kill Johnny. You knew he\u2019d be willing to take care of you no matter what. It\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever wanted, for someone to just love and take care of you while you didn\u2019t have to worry about a thing.\n\nYou move forward and put your arms back around Johnny and look into his eyes.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t killed okay?\u201d you say.\n\u201cNever. I\u2019ll always be around to protect and take care of you Suzy. My love for you will always keep me going forever and ever and ever and ever.\u201d\n\nThe way Johnny is looking at you while he strokes your hair each time for emphasis when he says \u201cand ever\u201d would probably be creepy to most, but you know its just his way of confirming his love you.\n\nYou\u2019re so lucky.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Sheltered Princess\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been about a month; Johnny should be home again soon. Just have to keep an ear open for that certain knock and his voice.\n\nYou wonder what things he will have brought home this time. You\u2019re still pretty much good with the necessities. Maybe he will have found some new movies or books to bring you this time.\n\nAt first when he started going out, you worried about him even though he assured you he would be fine. Of course as time went on, you ceased worrying altogether.\n\nStill, after the first few years, Johnny was getting restless. Sure he was going out, but never for long periods of time.\n\nThen one day he went out and didn\u2019t return for a full week. For the first time in a long while you worried so much when he did that. This caused an argument when he finally returned. You were so angry.\n\nYou even accused him of cheating on you, but deep down you knew that wasn\u2019t and would never be the case.\n\nTo Johnny\u2019s credit he was honest about what the problem was. He apologized realizing he should\u2019ve at least told you before disappearing like that. He tried, he really tried and he thought that \u201cyou\u201d would be enough, but he wasn\u2019t like you. He couldn\u2019t stay cooped up down in a shelter for long stretches of time. Even though he was in the presence of an \u201cangel\u201d he always felt like a trapped animal. Sometimes being around you made him feel and realize just how inferior he was to you.\n\nHe explained how the surface was better than he could\u2019ve ever imagined. No law, no order, and freedom to do whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted. The pull was too great and was getting greater.\n\nYou were upset and rightfully so. After all he had professed that he would always be there for you, and now who would take care of you if he left?\n\nJohnny however insisted that he wasn\u2019t going to break your heart. He assured you once again that he would still be there to take care of you; he just needed time to himself. He explained that he just needed to \u201cwander\u201d because deep down that\u2019s who he\u2019d always be. He also explained it would be safer for you if he did wander as he didn\u2019t want to one day unleash his\u2026urges out on you by accident.\n\nWhat could you do? How could you compete? He was a slave to his nature. It was like Bobby all over again.\n\nThat first time, you practically kicked him out and he left without struggle or even raising his voice, he just told you that he would keep his promise and that you would see that he would not fail you.\n\nNaturally you didn\u2019t believe him at the time you were too upset. That entire month was a pretty bad one for you. You spent most of your time crying and wondering if you\u2019d been a delusional fool for sticking your head in the sand and ignoring reality as usual. You even started reading those survival books that you hadn\u2019t actually gotten to reading yet and rationing your food and water a little more since you were potentially facing an uncertain future.\n\nBut then when that month had passed and Johnny did indeed return like he always had in the past.\n\nAt first you were reluctant to even let him back in, but then you realized that he had kept his promise just like he always has to you. The reunion was a happy one and over the years you\u2019ve gotten accustomed to this arrangement. In fact it\u2019s nice to be by yourself too. You\u2019d actually forgotten what that was like during the years Johnny was around all the time.\n\nYou hear a familiar pattern knock on the shelter door followed by Johnny\u2019s faint voice coming from the other side. After taking the usual safety precautions, you excitedly rush to open it with your pistol drawn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m home, my perfect angel.\u201d Johnny says smiling and holding a couple of bags no doubt stuffed with goodies.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there, come in! I missed you.\u201d You say and welcome Johnny back home like you always do.\n\nJohnny tells you a few things about the outside world like he always does, but in general you never care that much. As far as you\u2019re concerned, what he does out there you don\u2019t want to hear too much about and it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. All that matters is his time with you.\n\nYou happily accept all the gifts and supplies he has brought for you and later on you and he embrace as lovers do.\n\nThe pair of you enjoy your time together, until its time for Johnny to wander again. But you never despair about it, because you know he\u2019ll always come back.\n\nAnd one day, you know he\u2019ll come back forever.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but then nothing in this new world is.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Don\u2019t accept the answer", "result": "And with that lie you hear from Johnny, your head drops briefly in despair.

The first shot hits him in the body, causing him to fall backwards, but not enough to kill him, but you soon get over your shock and sorrow not just by remembering that he\u2019s killed Julie and Donna, but that eventually he\u2019ll kill you as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t stop pumping rounds into the son of a bitch until the pistol is completely empty.\n\nJohnny\u2019s body lies motionless in a bloody mess.

The problem is you can\u2019t very well carry it up the ladder from the shelter either, at least not in one piece.\n\nYou slowly get up and head back to the armory. There you find a good-sized machete that looks very sharp. You also get some garbage bags you saw in one of the supply rooms. You\u2019re not sure why Ben had them down here, but it\u2019s handy that he did.\n\nYou go back to Johnny\u2019s body. You think about dragging the body to the shelter\u2019s bathtub and doing your grisly work there, but you decide the best thing you can do is just to get it over with. You lay out some of the bags on the floor and roll Johnny\u2019s body on to them and get to work.\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy task for you and you get physically sick more than once, but eventually you get through it. Johnny\u2019s limbs, torso and head all get put into bags. You then make several trips up and down the ladder to haul the pieces up to the basement. It\u2019s still an exhausting task, even more so after having to go through hacking him up and the emotional drain you feel from it.\n\nYou don\u2019t go any further than the basement after you\u2019ve hauled all of Johnny\u2019s parts up. You\u2019re just not in the mood to deal with more. You look at the blood-drenched fatigues you\u2019re wearing and strip them off to throw them into one of the bags.\n\nLeaving the \u201cbody bags\u201d by the entrance, you go back to your room to get a spare set of clothes. You also see Kelly\u2019s body still lying in a heap there. Just reminds you that you\u2019ll have more cleaning up to do tomorrow.\n\nFor now though you grab something comfortable from the closet and head back down to the shelter where you take a long hot shower.

Everyone you know or close to is gone and you\u2019re truly alone now. Granted you\u2019ve spent most of your life alone, but there was still always someone around to intrude. Most of the time this was unwanted like when Kelly bullied you or when Peter stole your clothes. Other times this was your choice like spending time with Bobby.\n\nNow? There is nobody.\n\nYou finally get up and shuffle into the living room which still has a lot of blood on the floor.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) I guess I should clean that up too.\u201d You mutter to your self and remind yourself to get some of the cleaning products from upstairs.\n\nAfter ascending up the ladder you see the same garbage bags you left in a group nearby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back to take care you later Johnny.\u201d You say, then you glance your head towards your old room.\n\n\u201cYou too bitch.\u201d You say and head upstairs.\n\nWhen you get upstairs to get something to clean with, you notice several bags on the floor in the living room. They\u2019re yours or mostly yours anyway. It\u2019s all the stuff you brought with you from Julie\u2019s house. Johnny must\u2019ve brought them in from the jeep last night. He always was thoughtful.\n\nAs you go to get your bags, a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can\u2019t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n\u201c\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\nFrom the direction it looks like it probably hit the city, but it still had to be a \u201csmall\u201d one since you imagine your home still would\u2019ve suffered a backlash of your windows breaking from the long range impact.\n\nStill who knows which way the wind is blowing and there is no reason to not be extra cautious. So you gather up your bags and a few extra items and head back down to the shelter as quick as possible.\n\nAnd once again you\u2019re locked away from the outside world. This time possibly for a lot longer than average.

I told you I wouldn\u2019t be that long. I got here just in time to put on another movie! In fact I got some new ones from that redneck encampment. I know most of them are a bunch of assholes, but they\u2019re always up for trading and that Mel guy keeps \u2018em mostly in line.

(Which certainly draws a few onlookers)\n\nFortunately, the quick glances you do make into the rooms prove to not find your sister, so you head out to the backyard.\n\nThe backyard is a little more relaxed at least in terms of sex and drugs, though a few of the guys are doing some sort of stupid stunts and hurting themselves in the process and then laughing about it. Another guy is filming the whole thing. Several girls look on and shake their heads at the ordeal and telling them that they\u2019re going to really suffer serious injury if they don\u2019t stop.\n\nYou don\u2019t see your sister and you ask one of the girls watching the spectacle.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, do you know Donna?\u201d you ask a woman with short brown hair.\n\u201cHuh? Donna? Skinny little thing that thinks she\u2019s hot shit? Yeah I know her\u2026 hey you look a little like her\u2026actually I shouldn\u2019t insult you. You\u2019re actually prettier.\u201d The woman replies.\n\u201cUh, thanks. Yeah she\u2019s my sister and I was looking for her.\u201d\n\u201cSister huh? My condolences. Anyway, yeah I think I saw her inside talking with some guy. He didn\u2019t really stand out, in fact he didn\u2019t really look like what she normally goes for, but she was already pretty drunk and when that happens she typically doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Or rather she always gives a fuck. Hah.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I just looked inside, but I couldn\u2019t find her.\u201d\n\u201cDid you try the basement? She might be down there getting fucked, well assuming Julie isn\u2019t down there getting fucked. Not that it\u2019s ever stopped them from fucking in the same room before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no I haven\u2019t checked down there.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s probably where she is then. Now if you excuse me, I have get back to making sure my idiot boyfriend doesn\u2019t break his goddamn neck.\u201d\n\nYou leave the backyard and head back into the house. You decide you\u2019ve had enough of crowds and if your sister is fucking someone in the basement, you don\u2019t want to interrupt, so you head back to your room.\n\nJust before you reach your room however, a guy about your age opens up the door leading to the basement. Maybe this is the guy your sister was with.\n\n\u201cHey, is Donna down there?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHuh? Um, who are you?\u201d the man asks as if you\u2019re interrogating him.\n\u201cDonna. She\u2019s my sister. Someone said she might be in the basement with some guy. Are you him?\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s demeanor becomes a little more relaxed.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wait are you Suzy?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, your sister Donna mentioned you when I was talking with her. She wasn\u2019t lying, you are pretty.\u201d\n\u201cWait, she said that?\u201d\n\u201cSure, she was very praising of you.\u201d The man says.\n\u201c\u2026Donna? She was praising of me? I find that hard to believe, I just had a fight with her.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well maybe she was feeling bad about that, she seemed upset about it when we spoke.\u201d\n\nThe man seems to shift a bit and look sideways a couple times after he says that, and you become suspicious.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026well I need to go talk with her, but the man suddenly tries to stop you from going any further.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think you should. Like I said she\u2019s upset right now.\u201d\n\nYou take a quick glance at the man and see that his clothes are disheveled like he just put them back on in a hurry.\n\n\u201cFunny, I\u2019ve never know my sister to be upset after sex.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome on, your clothes were obviously put back on in a rush, I know what happened, so if she\u2019s finished with satisfying her urges, she should be in a much better mood to speak with me\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point the man stops you again.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re implying. I never touched your sister. She\u2019s a fucking whore. I was just trying to console her about you. SHE aggressively made the moves on me, but I resisted and then she started crying about what a whore she was and how she could never live up to being like you and screamed that she wanted to be left alone. Now I suggest you do just that, at least until she calms down. She\u2019s a little drunk too, so you probably should just let her sleep it off.\u201d\n\nWhile the man continues to maintain a smile, his tone is somewhat threatening. His whole story stinks of lies and you\u2019re getting a really bad vibe from him. Almost like you did with your uncle Ed.\n\n\u201cGet the hell out of my way. \u201d You say and push past him to descend down the steps quickly.\n\nUnfortunately you\u2019re not quick enough as the man to manage to shove you in back causing you to lose balance and go crashing down the stairs. While you\u2019re taking a tumble, the man locks the basement door and makes his way down the stairs in a normal fashion. The loud noise from the party ensures that nobody is going to investigate even if they bothered to.\n\nYou break your leg and smash the side of your head against the floor when you finally hit the bottom. You surprisingly don\u2019t scream out from the pain, but you are about to fall unconscious from your head injury.\n\nYour vision is blurry and you feel dizzy, but despite that, you see Donna sprawled out on the floor not that far from you. She\u2019s naked and isn\u2019t moving.\n\n\u201cDon\u2026\u201d you utter and stretch your hand out towards her.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it had to be like this Suzy. I really did want us to get off on the right foot. When your whore of a sister Donna was bitching about you to me, you sounded so\u2026 perfect. Such a shame\u2026\u201d the man says and then kicks you in the head.\n\nThe blackness takes you and then the man takes your life.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, {"action": "Contact Bobby", "result": "If Kelly wasn't putting the screws to you about moving out, you might be less inclined to return Bobby's phone call, however this is a desperate situation and despite your recent relationship problems, you still have strong feelings for Bobby and he will certainly help you out.\n\nYou grab your phone and call Bobby. The phone rings twice and then is answered.\n\n\"Hey Suzy, I've been trying to get a hold of you.\" Bobby blurts out as soon as he answers.\n\"Yeah I know.\" You say.\n\"Look, I know we've been having some difficulties lately, and our last argument was bad, but I really want to work things out, I love you.\"\n\nYou definitely have some major things to work out, but it's nice to know how Bobby feels about you.\n\n\"Well, we're going to be doing that, but that isn't the only reason why I called. I...uh need a new place to live. Kelly's kicking me out.\" You say.\n\"Oh, I see, you want to move in with me and my family...are you sure? I mean you know I really would like you there, but part of the reason why we were arguing was...\"\n\"Your sister Diana hates my guts.\" You interrupt.\n\"Well...I admit she's not fond of you, but I mean I think we can work past that. She's just going to have to accept that I'm with you now.\"\n\"But is she REALLY going to do that? Or am I going to find her hovering over me in the middle of the night with a knife in hand?\"\n\"She'd have a hell of a time sneaking in our room without waking me up first of all. Second, if I lay down the law to her, she's got no fucking choice BUT to accept it. I'M the head of the family after all and as head of it, my word is divinely inspired by Tiamat herself and to go against Tiamat is a blasphemy that even Diana would not do. So to sum up, you might have to hear some shit from her, but your physical well being is perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"Safe\" is a funny term to use for a guy who practices human sacrifice. Which is the other concern you have, since while you've long since accepted certain aspects of Bobby's belief system, you'd rather not see the gruesome details. Though you suppose that's just one more thing you're going to have to discuss.\n\nYou sort of wonder about the rest of Bobby's family though and how well you'll get along with them. He's got a family that's at least as big as yours was at one time, but you've never really interacted with any of them (Bobby never had you over his house much due to Diana's hostility) except for Bobby's second oldest sister Helen who was polite, if quiet.\n\nJust as you're thinking about this, Bobby springs something unexpected on you.\n\n\"Since you're wanting to move in, I should tell you that we won't be living in the house in the neighborhood. We're going to be living in a compound north outside of town.\"\n\"Wait, what?\" You say.\n\"It's the Morningstar family compound. We're moving there, or rather we've been in the process of moving all our stuff over there for the past few weeks. Never mentioned it since we were sort of arguing about other stuff.\"\n\"Wait, wasn't your house the Morningstar family compound?\"\n\"Heh, well that was certainly big enough for my immediate family, but I do have some extended family as well and given the current world climate, I had a video conference meeting with some of the extended family and most agreed that it might be best if we moved to the better fortified compound that my Dad had built over time decades ago.\"\n\"Holy shit, how many people are we going to be living with? I mean are we going to be restricted with what technology we can use, working a farm and the women have to put their hair up in a bouffant and wear simple clothing? If so then I can't deal with...\"\n\"What? No! Geez Suzy, we're worshippers of Tiamat, not the Amish or fucking Mormon fundies! No, we got all the conveniences of the modern world there and women can wear what they want, though there MIGHT come a day very soon when we will have to rely on farming of some sort, but I guarantee you won't be the one doing it.\"\n\nBobby continues.\n\n\"As for how many people are going to be living there, well that I'm not sure. There aren't as many of us anymore and some live quite far away. Not everyone was jumping at the idea either, so some may decide to not bother to make the trip. In any case, at most it might be twenty more people and even then we'll have more than enough room there. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nEasy for him to say, he's not the one that's just had this new information sprung on him. Bobby correctly senses your silence as concern.\n\n\"I sense some concern.\" Bobby says.\n\"Fucking right you sense some concern! Not only am I still worried about your sister, I'm now worried about even MORE of your... highly religious family. I mean how are the rest of them going to feel about you bringing in a non-believer?\"\n\"Oh I'm not worried about that. I'm confident you'll eventually see the colorful swirling chaos...or the light if you prefer.\" Bobby laughs.\n\"That's...... not exactly alleviating my concerns Bobby.\"\n\"Sorry, I'm just joking to lighten the mood....\"\n\nYou hear Bobby exhaling deeply before continuing.\n\n\"Suzy, I know this is more shit for you to take in and I know you've been very understanding about everything. It's one of the many reasons why you're so wonderful. I just want to stress that you won't be walking into some Jim Jones kool aid suicide cult compound. You'll be perfectly safe because you'll be with me, I'm the chosen of Tiamat and like I said, my word is going to be law at the compound. Look, I'll be by to pick you up tomorrow to take you there. If you're not feeling it after a few days, well I'm sure we can figure something else out. I want us to work out Suzy. I love you.\"\n\nThere is certainly no denying that Bobby feels very strongly about you. Again, while you still have reservations, you've never known Bobby to lie to you. As for the rest, you do know Bobby's family take their religion pretty seriously so you know Bobby isn't exaggerating about you being safe with him. In fact if the threat of physical violence is gone, that actually already puts you ahead of your situation here considering Kelly has pushed you around and threatened to do more on many occasions.\n\n\"I feel the same way Bobby. Okay, I'll pack and I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\nBobby's voice sounds a bit more upbeat when you agree to go with him, though again if you had the option of staying home, you certainly would. Still, you're trying to maintain a positive open minded attitude about all this.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Bobby you waste no time in packing your most important belongings. As the night approaches, you finish up with your packing and get to sleep a little earlier. You get the feeling you're going to need all your energy for what lies ahead tomorrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day", "result": "MONDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world hot dog eating championship! Let's all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe the mayonnaise off your lips, graciously stand up and bow for your adoring fans. The grossly fat dude on your right looks at you in disbelief and then turns away to puke in a bucket.\n\nMeanwhile the little Asian dude on your left just shakes his head wondering how the hell you could've beaten him.\n\n\"I don't understand it...all my training. I glanced over at you during the contest...you...you were barely even chewing! How?\" He asks.\n\"Oh just natural talent at swallowing hot dogs I suppose.\" You reply humbly and wink at the audience, which continues to praise you.\n\nWhile you're blowing kisses at your fans, the announcer of the contest speaks again.\n\n\"And as an extra special reward, our glorious host of this event, Misty will be coming soon to congratulate our winner in person. This hasn't happened in decades! Perhaps even centuries! It's all just so exciting! Oh wait...I think that's Misty now!\"\n\nAt this point the wind begins to pick up significantly, which is amazing since this contest was taking place in an indoor stadium. The audience seems to be going even wilder, but at this point you're getting a little concerned.\n\nYour concern becomes fear when the fat bastard to your right melts into a gory pile of goo, the Asian guy's head gets really large like in one of those anime cartoons and he screams before running away shouting about Tokyo getting destroyed by a giant lizard.\n\nYou look back at the audience and see that they've begun stripping off their clothes and embracing each other in the biggest orgy you've ever seen. (Even larger than that porno you watched one time)\n\nThe roof suddenly comes off the stadium revealing a dark sky with a jet black swirling hole above.\n\n\"And here comes Misty folks! It's absolutely...GLORIOUS.\" The disembodied voice says as its pitch changes to demonic tone.\n\nYou can't run, you can't even move, you just stare at this unearthly sight like a deer in the headlights completely frozen.\n\nYou see the flash of a couple red glowing orbs in the black hole above you and then the wind picks you up and you're being pulled towards it.\n\n\"COME TO ME SUZY. COME TO US. COME. COME. COME...\" A deep voice echoes all around you which is backed up by the audience who are chanting along with having their orgy.\n\nYou vainly try to struggle, but there isn't much you can do accept uselessly flail about in midair as you are slowly enveloped by darkness. Even when you try to scream, you make no sound, in fact all your senses go numb and everything goes black.\n\nYou are then awakened by the ringing of your phone. At first you look around briefly still wondering if you're still levitating towards a black hole, but you breathe a sigh of relief that it was all just a dream.\n\nHowever, even though you're wide-awake, you still feel shaken up. Something about that dream seemed really unnerving and you usually aren't one to put much stock into your dreams.\n\nThe ringing of the phone takes priority before dream analysis though, so after fumbling with it a bit you answer it.\n\n\"Hey I've been trying to get a hold of you. We're you still asleep?\" Bobby asks.\n\"Yeah, are you outside the house already?\" You answer.\n\"Nah, I'm on my way over. I hope you're packed and ready to go though, because it's nuts out here. I know you don't tend to leave the house much, but if you've been out lately, you'd know it's been getting fucking crazy in town. Seriously, you'll see how fucked up it is out there when we drive through town. The cops are everywhere, groups of people are rioting, like I said, it's a mess. Okay, I need to focus on the road, there's a meat wagon picking up some bodies off the road. I'll see you soon. Love you.\" Bobby says and hangs up.\n\nAs you take a quick shower before getting ready to leave, you think more about your strange dream. You wonder if it was some sort of subconscious thing that your mind was telling you that this move is a bad idea. You have to admit, you still are feeling very unsure about it, especially now that Bobby has told you that you're moving into an isolated compound with not just his immediate family, but a bunch of other family that could be even crazier.\n\nStill, this could just be mostly anxiety of leaving a place where you've traditionally always felt safe and lived most of your life combined with a freaky dream. Bobby did say you could leave if you weren't comfortable there, so you're trying to not to focus on the possible negatives.\n\nYou try to calm your nerves the old fashioned way and think about Bobby the entire time.\n\nExiting the shower, getting dressed and grabbing your packed bags, you finally leave your basement. You packed as much as you could, hopefully you can return to get the rest later.\n\nYou head upstairs and you're not waiting long before you hear a knock on the door. Upon answering it, you see Bobby who embraces you with a hug and a kiss.\n\n\"By Tiamat, I've missed your body against mine.\" Bobby says caressing you all over.\n\"I never would have guessed. I have missed your touch as well though Bobby. Let me just get my bags.\"\n\nYou turn around and bend over to grab your bags and that's when Bobby grabs you around the waist and if it wasn't for the fabric separating the two of you, he'd also be inside you. It's startling enough that you probably would've lost you balance had Bobby not been holding on to you so tightly.\n\n\"What the hell? Sheesh Bobby, I nearly fell forward on my face!\"\n\"You wouldn't have, I got you. Mmm, I just can't help myself, I just...\" At this point Bobby starts kissing on your neck and groping you.\n\"Bobby, Bobby, stop. My brother Peter is still here in the connected garage. Last thing I need is for him to hear us and then suddenly walk in on me getting plowed from behind. Besides, didn't you say it's getting crazy out there? Shouldn't we be getting the hell out of town?\"\n\"Yeah, it's wonderfully chaotic out there. Like Tiamat herself has blessed this town. It really started putting me in the mood and then seeing you...well how can I not want to make love to you in the midst of all this chaos?\"\n\nBobby at this point is trying pull your shirt off over your head and you hear the sound of a zipper being unzipped, though with as excited as he is, you dare say it could just impale you through his pants. He's grunting, slobbering all over your neck and sniffing your hair and...well he REALLY wants you right now.\n\nThis isn't really what you had in mind and something about the way Bobby is behaving is a bit...animalistic. He's never been that way in your other intimate encounters with him. Well not excessively so at any rate.\n\nAlso, you HAVE been fighting for awhile, and it's sort of presumptuous of him to just think you're going to spread your legs immediately because you're on good terms again.\n\nThen again, this is sort of turning you on right now, and it has been awhile for you.

Let's at least go down to the basement and we can fuck on my couch.\"\n\"Okay, okay, whatever, let's just get down their quickly.\" Bobby agrees continuing to kiss on you.\n\nThe pair of you head down into the basement and one of Bobby's hands is practically glued to your ass the entire time.\n\nWhen you get to your room, you see that Bobby has somehow managed to strip off most of his clothing by this point (amazing considering he had one hand on your ass the entire time). He helpfully starts stripping your clothing off.\n\n\"Well seeing as you're obviously taking the alpha male approach to this, after you're done tearing off my clothes, you can carry me over to the sofa and start doing me like a conquering warrior. I want to see your face stare into mine as you thrust into me, let me know who exactly is in charge and teach me a lesson.\" You say licking your index finger and then running your finger down Bobby's chest.\n\n(Never let it be said that you can't tap into your dirty side when necessary)\n\nThe next half hour is fun, if a little rougher than you're used to with Bobby.\n\nIt starts off with him just really ramming it into you and telling you in various ways to \"Take it.\" while staring directly into your eyes which are more piercing than usual. His hands are also mostly holding down your wrists at this point.\n\nDespite all this, you aren't scared. You just wrap your legs around him tightly like a boa constrictor and enjoy the ride.\n\nA little later he put his hands around your neck and even squeezes a little while continuing to stare into your eyes. You can certainly still breathe, but he is definitely establishing his dominance and that he is firmly in control of things.\n\nDespite all this, you still aren't really scared, you even add to the \"experience\" by squeaking out a \"No.\" \"Please don't.\" \"Stop hurting me.\" every now and then.\n\nEventually Bobby chants something in a language you've never heard before and then orgasms. Again, not really scary since he's always doing that. It was weird the first few times you had sex with him but now it acts as a nice little alarm letting you know that things will be over soon.\n\nCompletely spent after orgasm, Bobby collapses on top of you and begins hugging you tightly, and then whispers...\n\n\"I love you so much Suzy, I want us to be joined forever. I want our bodies as well as our souls to be married.\"\n\nNOW you get scared and suddenly push him off of you in alarm at this declaration.\n\n\"What?! Married?\" You exclaim recoiling to one corner of the couch.\n\nBobby's a little surprised by your reaction.\n\n\"I want us to be married. I mean we're obviously soul mates and its the next logical step for us.\"\n\"Step? What step? We were just having fun a moment ago and now you spring life long commitment?\"\n\"Are you saying you never saw us eventually getting married? I mean in all that time since we've been together?\"\n\"No, and especially not when all the trouble with your sister came about.\"\n\"But on several occasions you asked me to run away with you! You didn't think we'd get married if we ever did that even?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"I'm guessing you didn't ever think about having children either then.\"\n\"Children?! What the hell, you think I'm some sort of brood mother?\n\nNow Bobby is downright confused.\n\n\"Suzy... I really don't understand your... well view of things...\" Bobby says.\n\"That pretty rich coming from the cultist.\" You say.\n\"Okay, I'm going to ignore that because I love you. But if it makes any difference, at least I still behave in a consistent way which you do not.\"\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"(Sigh) I really don't want us to fight again...\"\n\"Bobby I just let you simulate what could be considered a rape fantasy on me, the least you can do is explain yourself.\"\n\"Okay then THAT right there is what I'm talking about. You have no problem with having kinky sex with me, you have no major problems with my religion and what it entails, you're even willing to move in with me and my family even though you're concerned about my sister and probably the rest of them, but somehow marriage is what is freaking you out? I mean I'm trying to do the right thing here and it's because I genuinely love you. Why are you so resistant?\"\n\nIt's actually a good question. You're pretty tolerant of a lot of stuff most would've recoiled in horror from and something like marriage and (shudder) kids is scaring you off. There's probably a good psychological reason for your reluctance, involving your observations of other married couples such as your own mother (overly compliant) and father (distant) or your brother Ben (paranoid psychotic) and his wife (utterly clueless) but there are a few other concerns.\n\n\"Bobby...you've never brought up marriage before either, why all of a sudden?\" You ask.\n\"Well, I just think it's time. I mean we've been together awhile. We've stuck together through ups and downs. We're going to be living together. I obviously love you and I assume you love me right?\"\n\"Well...yeah...but... I dunno...I mean kids? Come on do you really think I'm mother material? I can barely take care of myself...in fact I can't at all, otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.\"\n\nAt this point Bobby takes your hand into his and gets closer to you.\n\"Suzy, don't you see, you don't need to worry about any of that anymore. When you marry me you won't have to worry about taking care of yourself ever again. And as far as being mother material, I can't imagine a better mother to my children. Even if you do have trouble, I'm sure my sisters will help out...well okay Helen will help out, but you know what I'm saying. The main thing is you won't have any more worries when you're in the family...MY family. We'll look after you. I'll look after you.\"\n\nAnd there it is. Your future. A \"housewife\" popping out a whole mess of little cultists like a Pez dispenser. While it might not be quite that extreme, the writing is on the wall. While Bobby is probably sincere in his love and desire to care for you, he's still the head of a human sacrificing cult and as such he's going to be somewhat controlling and manipulative.\n\nHow long before you become brainwashed into believing in the same shit he believes in? How long before you passively accept other sudden changes over time? Hell, how long before some organization like the FBI or the ATF comes charging in to lay siege to the place?\n\nThough on the other hand what are you really doing with your life right now and what prospects do you really have? You could do worse than have a man who obviously loves you a lot and is willing to take care of the stuff you don't want to bother worrying about.\n\nYou've got a major life changing decision to make, because you get the impression that if you get into that compound of his, changing you mind isn't going to be an option.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept his proposal", "result": "\"Okay, Bobby. I suppose you're right. We both love each other and that's the most important thing...so yes.

Come on let's get going!\" Bobby exclaims.\n\nBobby immediately starts grabbing his clothing that he left in various places in the basement on the way to your room and getting dressed. Your own clothing is a bit torn now, so you grab some new clothes that were still in your closet.\n\nHeading back upstairs, Bobby picks up your bags and carries them to this van. He opens the door for you and everything. You did miss his attention to the little things like that.\n\nAs soon as you leave your neighborhood you notice what Bobby was talking about the town. He wasn't kidding when he said it\u2019s a mess. You see police trying maintain order, fights, car wrecks, fire fighters trying put out fires and ambulances blaring their sirens.\n\nAs Bobby focuses on the road, he goes on about how everything that's currently going on in town is just a small sample of what's to come. He talks about how there are several wars are going on in the world and how tensions are at an all time high. (He actually sounds like one of those Ground Zero infomercials on that bit) He mentions how everything is always trending towards chaos and entropy and how the signs that Tiamat is finally coming back to return the world to its natural state. Between your recent acceptance of his proposal and this, you don't think you've ever seen him so happy and excited.\n\n\"Well whatever's going on, I'm glad we are leaving town, it's like everyone here has lost their mind.\" You say.\n\"Yeah, some of my family don't agree that we should go to the compound. Some say we should be out here personally embracing the increasing chaos in the world like Tiamat would want, but... as I said there aren't a lot of us and I'd still like to make sure we're relatively safe. I believe Tiamat would want her chosen to be smart about things. Build up our numbers over time and THEN we will rise to become a force that none can oppose.\"\n\nYou don't say much, you just nod and smile. You imagine you're going to be directly contributing to those \"numbers.\" You cross your legs at the thought.\n\nEventually you manage to get out of town and things are slightly better and the traffic is even thinning out. You've never been north of town before...actually you've never been out of town before. You also never realized how rural of an area you lived in.\n\nThe quiet calm of the great outdoors is actually a little scarier than the chaos of the town you just left behind, doesn't help that it's getting dark by this point.\n\nBobby ends up turning off the main road to an unsaved dirt one leading further into wilderness. Just as you're wonder how much further, you see the compound (surrounded by a high fence with razor wire of course) and it's certainly big enough and imposing enough to make any cult leader jealous.\n\n\"Shit, it looks like a small prison.\" You say.\n\"Yeah my dad and some of his brothers were constantly adding on to this thing for decades. To be honest, it isn't even completely finished. I mean it's more than sufficient for several people to comfortably live in, but there are many rooms that are just the bare minimum of four walls. Towards the back where you can't see from here, there are some portions of it that are exposed to the outside. However, seeing as there will be a bunch of us living here now, I think we'll at least be able to finish the place up, and in time make even more additions.\"\n\"Didn't know your dad had brothers.\"\n\"Yeah three older, and one younger. A younger sister too, but none of them will be coming here.\"\n\"Oh. Wait, all of them are dead?\"\n\"No, the two younger siblings, Uncle Leslie and Aunt Lilith are still alive. In fact Leslie and Lilith live in a house together south of town. But let's just say they aren't exactly believers in the faith and chose a different path instead...I'm sure you've heard of the Ground Zero corporation especially with all their annoying infomercials and ads everywhere nowadays.\"\n\"Wait, seriously? You've got family that works for GZ? You never told me that before either.\" You ask.\n\"My dad wasn't really on speaking terms with either of them. Long story. Anyway, technically just Aunt Lilith works for GZ. Dunno doing what, but I think it's important. Uncle Leslie just lives with her and spends most of his time indulging in his pointless experiments, though I know he does some black market organ shit on the side.\" Bobby explains.\n\"I guess you couldn't get your aunt to pull a few strings and get set up in one of those shelters they're always trying to sell huh?\" You say.\n\"Actually I did contact her during the recent family video conference. She told me that we'd all be much better off in dad's slightly unfinished compound than in one of those shelters. Apparently half of those things are death traps or something. She said even though she wasn't a believer, she still didn't want to subject her nieces and nephews to the fate of being in one of those live-in mass coffins.\"\n\"Well that was nice of her to look out for you.\"\n\"Yeah, she always was one of the nicest people in our family. Dunno why she's with Uncle Leslie, the guy is a psychotic asshole to practically everyone. Good doctor though. Anyway, let's see who's on duty tonight.\" Bobby says pulling up to the large gate.\n\nBobby rolls down his window and speaks into an intercom.\n\n\"Hey, it's Bobby. Anyone there?\"\n\"Bobby? Where the hell have you been? Thought you were going back into town and coming straight back to help with arranging all this furniture.\" A voice replies a few moments later.\n\"Yeah well I had something really important to do and town is crazy right now. Did anyone else show up since yesterday?\"\n\"Nah, but a few people called saying they were going to get in by tomorrow at least.\"\n\"Okay, what's everyone else doing right now?\"\n\"Um, well mostly everyone's asleep or otherwise retired to their rooms. Except me who drew the short straw to keep a look out for you.\"\n\"What?! Asleep already? It's not that late!\" Bobby exclaims.\n\"Well everyone was a bit tired from all the moving around. Also your sister Helen felt the young ones should get a good night's sleep earlier since there's more shit to do tomorrow.\"\n\"Hmm, well I had a big announcement to make, but I suppose if everyone is mostly in dreamland right now, it can wait until tomorrow. Might as well anyway seeing as you said more people are supposed to show up. Okay let us in William.\"\n\"Us, huh? I guess that means you have a certain lady with you? Oh Tiamat, can't wait to see Diana's reaction to that one.\" William remarks.\n\"Diana's gonna just have to fucking deal with it, I'm the fucking head of this family and I love this woman!\"\n\"Sheesh, calm down Bobby. I got no problem with that. I will just ask one thing, is she one of us?\"\n\nBobby looks over at you which puts you a bit on the spot.\n\n\"I love you Bobby, and I go where you go now.\" You say which is enough of a positive answer for Bobby who has a big grin due to your answer.\n\n\"Yes, of course she is.\" Bobby remarks.\n\"Well then she's alright with me. Come on in around the right side, you'll be less likely to wake up the others and nobody is using that side of the building right now, so you'll have that big bedroom over there all to yourself.\"\n\nAnd with that the large gate slides open and Bobby drives you both in. He passes a few parked cars on his way over to the right wing of the compound and parks a few feet in front of a large door. You and he both get out.\n\nYou attempt to get your bags, but again he insists on carrying them for you. He hands you the keys to the door to open it though, which you do and you both enter.\n\nAfter turning on a light switch, Bobby takes the lead.\n\n\"Come on, down this corridor and through a couple of rooms.\"\n\"This place isn't quite as spartan as I imagined. You've got some rather nice carpeting and even the wall coloring is fairly cheerful.\" You say walking and looking around.\n\"I told you, this is our home, and we have to live here comfortably. We're not trying to create a psychologically oppressive effect to break down the willpower of potential followers, so what's the point of having a depressing drab gray everywhere?\"\n\"Makes sense. The artwork you got up is pretty...interesting as well.\" You say glancing at the various strange pictures hanging up ranging from multi headed dragons to gory scenes of sacrifices.\n\"Oh, yeah. My grandmother painted most of these.\" Bobby replies.\n\"Really? Well, she certainly made some vivid scenes. That one with young raven haired naked lady holding the bloody dagger surrounded by the corpses is pretty detailed. Probably the best one of the bunch.\" You say being supportive.\n\"It should be the best one considering that's a self portrait of her. Took her a few months to finish it apparently because she wanted to get the color of decay just right for the bodies. Yep, she sure was talented.\"\n\nBobby stares a bit at his long dead grandmother's naked image for a moment until you wave your hand in front of him.\n\n\"Sorry, it's a bit hypnotic at times. Like the eyes follow you.\" Bobby says.\n\"Hrmmm. Sure it's not two other things?\" You ask.\n\"Ha ha, well gotta admit, Grandma was pretty hot back in the day.\"\n\"That...would be disturbing even if I wasn't your soon to be wife.\" You remark. (Though you\u2019re not really THAT disturbed given what you know of Bobby\u2019s family)\n\"Oh I'm joking, you know you're the only one for me.\" Bobby says and kisses you on the cheek before saying you'll be heading up some nearby stairs.\n\nA flight of stairs, another corridor, a few rooms later and you're finally at your destination. A fully furnished master bedroom with all the comforts.\n\n\"Well gotta admit, this is a very nice room. A little heavy on the red coloring, but I'll definitely be comfortable here especially since I'm starting to get tired.\"\n\"Hey go ahead and relax. You're home now. I'd join you, but I think I better go see my cousin William to get a proper update on what's been going on, so I'll be back later.\"\n\"Okay then.\" you say stretching out on the bed.\n\nBobby kisses you goodbye and you're alone at last.\n\nYou think about grabbing your laptop, but the bag it's in is too far and you're far too comfortable so you just spend your time scanning the room with your eyes thinking about your situation.\n\nWhen you look over to your left you notice another self portrait of Grandma Morningstar. Fortunately, she's got all her clothes on in this one and is in a more traditional pose. Same stern and confident look though.\n\n\"Well I guess I'll be joining the family officially soon. Hope you approve from...well wherever you guys go when you shuffle off this mortal coil.\" You say towards the direction of the painting, though you don't look at it too long. Bobby's right, there is something a little hypnotic about the pictures of her.\n\nInstead you close your eyes as the comfort of the bed and silence causes you to soon fall asleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "TUESDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world banana eating championship! Let's all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe away the whipped cream on your lips, graciously stand up and bow for your adoring fans. The big dude on your right wearing nothing but chaps and a biker jacket looks at you in disbelief and then turns away to puke in a bucket.\n\nMeanwhile the little Asian She-Male on your left just shakes his head wondering how the hell you could've beaten him.\n\n\"I don't understand it...all my training. I glanced over at you during the contest...you...you were barely even chewing! How?\" He asks.\n\"Oh just natural talent at swallowing bananas I suppose.\" You reply humbly and wink at the audience, which continues to praise you.\n\nWhile you're blowing kisses at your fans, you suddenly get a feeling you\u2019ve done something like this before\u2026.\n\nSuddenly a hand touches your shoulder and you spin around to see a woman about your age with long raven colored hair and a low cut black gown. She\u2019s pretty, but has a sneering look on her face. It\u2019s not quite a cruel look, but she\u2019s definitely not impressed with you.\n\n\u201cSo, you think you got what it takes to meet Misty huh? Pfft. I don\u2019t see you lasting another day. Maybe two at best.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Misty?\u201d you ask.\n\u201c(Sigh) Deary, if you don\u2019t know, then you\u2019ll never know. And if you never know, then how can you ever hope to survive?\u201d the woman says in a condescending tone and then starts laughing at you. She then begins to age rapidly until she becomes a wizened crone and then eventually a rotting corpse.\n\nWhen you begin to step back, the woman then disappears, but her laughter remains, getting louder and louder to the point being deafening and causing pain.\n\nYou futilely attempt to cover your ears, but the laughter persists even when you try to cram left over bananas in your ears.\n\nMeanwhile, the biker turns in a unicorn and the she-male turns into rainbow colored fox which jumps on the back of the unicorn and they run off together. The audience surprisingly has completely disappeared. In fact it\u2019s just you and that awful laughter that won\u2019t quit.\n\nJust when you think you can\u2019t take the pain anymore everything goes black\u2026\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a female voice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d you exclaim sitting up fast.\n\u201cOh! Sorry! I\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to wake you\u2026but I just was told to bring you this.\u201d the source of the female voice says.\n\nYou rub your eyes and see a young woman with light brown hair before you holding a tray of food. She\u2019s probably a few years younger than you.\n\n\u201c\u2026wait\u2026you\u2019re Helen right?\u201d you say recognizing her.\n\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t think you remembered me. We only saw each other a couple times before.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cYeah I remember you. Where\u2019s Bobby?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Bobby\u2019s busy doing something with cousin William. I think its something to do with working on the compound here. I\u2019m not really sure. I just tend to look after the little ones, but Bobby told me I should bring you something to eat, so um here.\u201d\n\nHelen thrusts the tray of food at you. It consists of typical breakfast type food like scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal and juice. You see no reason not to take the offering seeing as you aren\u2019t served like this very often.\n\n\u201cWow, breakfast in bed. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve never had before.\u201d You say and start to eat.\n\nHelen stares at you nervously, which causes you to stop eating.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh! Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you liked it. Is the food good? I really didn\u2019t know what to make you and I just wanted it to be right.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine Helen.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh good. I just\u2026I just didn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just breakfast Helen. Relax. Probably way better than anything I could make, I dunno how to cook.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? Didn\u2019t your mother teach you?\u201d Helen asks as if cooking is something every woman knows how to do.\n\u201cNope. She taught me how to sew when I was younger, but I sort of stopped doing it when she died of a flesh-eating virus. Didn\u2019t really see the point anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, how sad!\u201d Helen says empathetically.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You say continuing to eat.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a very good cook and I can even teach you!\u201d\n\u201cHm, well between that offer and this meal, you\u2019ve probably done more for me than my own family has in years.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you said that. I want us to get along because I know you\u2019re going to be married to Bobby and all.\u201d\n\u201cWait, Bobby told you already?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe told everyone last night. He was so happy. I\u2019m so glad he was, I like seeing him happy.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I can guess who wasn\u2019t happy to hear about it.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cOh. Yes. Um\u2026you probably mean Diana. Yes, she was quite upset. Um\u2026in fact I probably should leave. She\u2019s looking after the little ones and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get an earful about being away from my duties for so long. She\u2019s in a bad enough mood as it is.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cOkay, well sorry to keep you then. I don\u2019t want to get you into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not really worried about me anyway. It\u2019s just if I stay away for too long she might\u2026 well she\u2019s not as patient as I am with our younger siblings. So are you okay with the food and everything?\u201d\n\u201cYeah Helen.\u201d\n\u201cOkay good. Good. Um\u2026okay I\u2019m going now. Um, I suppose I\u2019ll see you around some time.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d\n\nAt this point Helen nervously waves and opens the door to leave, but then she calls out to you.\n\n\u201cUm, Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re going to be part of this family soon.\u201d She says with a faint smile and then leaves.\n\nYou shake your head and finish your food. Helen obviously has some issues. Though maybe its because you know what its like to have a bullying older sister, you can sympathize.\n\nAfter putting aside your food tray you take a shower in the private bathroom connected to the bedroom which is very convenient. While washing up you take time to ponder your odd dream which while having its surreal moments seemed \u201creal\u201d to you in some ways. The raven haired woman in the dream was most certainly Bobby\u2019s grandmother which is sort of creepy, but then maybe she just popped up due you seeing pictures of her (and even one in your room) earlier that night. Ultimately you decide not to worry too much about it unless this becomes an ongoing problem.\n\nAfter your shower, you then change your clothing and decide to explore what is now your new home.\n\nYou walk around the right wing of the compound, upstairs and down, not running into anyone. It\u2019s all pretty empty on this side which is sort of good you suppose and you\u2019re half tempted to just go back to your new room and play on your computer. However, you figure you\u2019re going to have to make the effort to be social with everyone so you head over to the central part of the compound where you assume more of Bobby\u2019s family is located.\n\nEventually you get to a large dining area and see a few dirty plates still on the table. The voices of children can be heard a few rooms away and then\u2026\n\nThat red headed witch Diana steps out from the kitchen.\n\nShe holds a knife in one hand and you notice her hand tighten around its handle when she sees you.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want any trouble Diana. I know you\u2019re mad but\u2026\u201d you start to say before Diana interrupts.\n\u201cSpare me your pathetic words blonde whore. You will not sway me with superficial attempts at diplomacy. YOU are in my way, but I promise you that before the week\u2019s end, you will be out of it.\u201d\n\nWhen you cautiously step back a bit, Diana smirks.\n\n\u201cYou better keep stepping backwards and out the front door if you want to stay out of my way AND keep your pitiful life.\u201d\n\nWhile Diana is doing a fairly adequate job of intimidating you, she\u2019s actually starting to make you angry. Like a rage is building up within you and you feel like just picking up one of the forks on one of the dirty plates on the table and stabbing her in the neck with it.\n\nIn fact violent visions start to enter your head, visions of bloody bodies and other murderous images. They hit you so suddenly; you actually stumble and keep yourself from falling by propping yourself up against the table. You then rub your head from this spell, as you don\u2019t feel completely well.\n\n\u201cNow what? Am I scaring you too much? Are you about to cry? By Tiamat you really are worthless. And that is why you\u2019ll never make a good wife to my brother. You\u2019re far too weak. My brother will realize that soon.\u201d Diana remarks.\n\nAs unwell as you suddenly feel, the rage within you is still rising.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack Diana", "result": "You already put up with one bullying asshole of an older sister who basically threw you out your house, you\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll let someone else do it again.\n\nYou turn your head to address Diana.\n\n\u201cHey, you know what your brother also realized? That I\u2019m more fun in the bed than you are. Told me you were about as fun as fucking a log and about as lively too. Yeah, I\u2019m crying alright, I\u2019m crying tears of laughter at your fucking stupidity if you actually think you have a chance at getting Bobby back.\u201d\n\nIf Diana were a cartoon character you\u2019d imagine this would be the part where steam shoots out of her head and her face goes completely red.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking dead blondie!\u201d Diana shouts and runs at you with the knife in hand.\n\nYou grab one of the plates on the table and throw it at her. She dodges, but it\u2019s enough to get her a bit off balance while you grab a fork and plunge it into the side of her arm.\n\n\u201cAgh SHIT!\u201d she shouts , but manages to swipe at you with her knife which barely misses your face. You don\u2019t have time to retrieve your fork from her arm.\n\nYou throw another plate at her, which causes her to drop her knife when she blocks her face with her hands. She recovers quickly however and pulls the fork from her arm and lunges at you with it.\n\nAs the pair of you struggle, you and Diana have made enough noise for others to take notice of it. Helen comes walking into the room with a couple of kids behind her and freaks out.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026Stop! Stop it! Don\u2019t fight!\u201d she exclaims and then screams for help and runs over to attempt to disarm her sister.\n\n\u201cPlease Diana, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Helen utters before Diana shoves her aside. At least this allows you to grab Diana\u2019s wrist and slam it hard on the edge of the table, causing her to drop the fork. Doesn\u2019t stop her from punching you with her free hand though.\n\nHelen once again tries to pull the two of you apart, but fails to do so. She ends up shouting at the cheering children who are enjoying the violent display to go fetch help.\n\nMeanwhile Diana is slightly getting the better of you in this fight as she lands a kick to your stomach, flooring you. You wheeze and have a hard time catching your breath.\n\n\u201cYou actually thought you could challenge me? What was that about me being the stupid one?\u201d Diana taunts as she picks up a nearby chair. You barely manage to roll out of the way when she tries to bring it down on your head.\n\nDesperate to gain the advantage again, you struggle to get back up and start throwing plates at her again. She manages to deflect them with the chair, but then with all your energy you charge at her and holding on to the other end of the chair you slam her into the wall.\n\nYou manage to pull the chair away and then it\u2019s just you and her again. At first you\u2019re scratching, punching and slapping each other upright and then soon the pair of you are rolling on the floor.\n\n\u201cBy Tiamat\u2019s Chaotic Cunt, quick grab \u2018em both!\u201d you hear a male voice shout.\n\nA mass of various arms and hands grab you and Diana and after a bit of prying, the would be peacemakers succeed in keeping you and Diana from doing anymore damage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT FUCKING SCARED OF YOU AND I\u2019M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!\u201d you scream at Diana who is being pulled away by Helen and another well dressed man you don\u2019t recognize.\n\u201cWhoa, easy! Easy! I gotcha.\u201d The male voice says that spoke earlier. You look and see the one who has pulled you away from Diana and see a scruffy looking man.\n\u201cLet go of me!\u201d you exclaim and pull away from the man who lets you go.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, you\u2019re free, now I heard you two don\u2019t like each other, but already? What the hell happened?\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Diana both start accusing each other of starting the fight. After some shouting you demand to know where Bobby is.\n\n\u201cBobby isn\u2019t here. He actually left an hour ago to go gather some stuff from the old house. (Sigh) I wish he was here though, because this is definitely his problem not mine.\u201d The scruffy man says.\n\u201cYeah, well who the fuck are you anyway?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re actually a little different than I expected considering what Bobby has said about you. Though if you need to the introductions, I\u2019m William. Mr. fancy over there is Brandon.\u201d William remarks.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Brandon says.\n\nDiana interrupts this temporary break in the hostilities by attempting to attack you again, but Brandon and Helen manage to hold her back, meanwhile William grabs you since you attempt to defend yourself.\n\n\u201cLet me go! Why the fuck are you all holding me back?! You should be letting me kill this fucking outsider and serving her heart up to Tiamat!\u201d Diana exclaims.\n\u201cYeah, while that would normally be the plan, you know damn well this is Bobby\u2019s bride to be and he\u2019s the head of the family. Now I know your pissed about that but them\u2019s the rules.\u201d William remarks.\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up William you don\u2019t know shit about how I feel! And since when do you give a shit about the rules for anything?\u201d Diana says.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you both of those. However I DO respect your brother and he loves this woman so you and nobody else will be sacrificing or harming her in any way\u2026besides given how she was fighting, I\u2019d say she shows promise of fitting right in in this family.\u201d William laughs.\n\nDiana shakes her head, fumes and huffs about her situation. She looks like she\u2019s about to attack you again, but instead she pushes Helen out of the way and storms off. Despite being pushed Helen follows her sister in an effort to console her.\n\n\u201cWell. That was exciting. If we\u2019re all done here, I\u2019ll be checking on Veronica and making sure the young ones aren\u2019t getting into the armory or something. Um, nice meeting you Suzy.\u201d Brandon remarks straightening out his suit and walks away.\n\nYou sit down on a nearby chair rubbing the upper left side of your face, which is probably sporting a bruise or soon will be. You still feel angry, but you\u2019re too tired to go chasing after Diana at this moment. You notice William still lingering around and staring at you.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOkay, just settle down now. I\u2019m not the enemy here.\u201d William remarks.\n\u201cMaybe not, but I don\u2019t really care for your staring right now.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough. Like I said, you\u2019re just much different than what I expected. Bobby mentioned to me you were this gentle quite girl. More like Helen actually. Never expected you to be giving Diana a good fight. On your second day here no less.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well everyone has their limits.\u201d\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s true too, though I\u2019m sure you know why Diana doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know, and you know what? That\u2019s tough shit and she needs to just get the fuck over it. Bobby wants to marry ME. Not her. It isn\u2019t my fault that she\u2019s not woman enough for him. To my understanding she had YEARS with him. If she couldn\u2019t hang on to him with that much of a head start, I\u2019d say the problem was with her, not me.\u201d\n\nWilliam smiles at your remark.\n\n\u201cMan, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d like you, but shit if you weren\u2019t Bobby\u2019s bride to be, I\u2019D marry you. Well if I was the marrying type. Anyway, I\u2019d say you handled the situation with Diana the only way you could have. She at least knows she can\u2019t just bully you like she does with poor Helen. Still, I\u2019d watch out. It isn\u2019t over with her. She\u2019s not going to just let this go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Bobby about this and he\u2019s going to just have to straighten her out once and for all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that MIGHT work in the short term, but Diana doesn\u2019t let go of grudges and given that you\u2019ll officially become family soon, she\u2019s likely to ignore him. Look, it\u2019s like this. Diana is definitely going to try to do something to you before you can marry Bobby because if she succeeds in getting you out of the picture before that happens, she won\u2019t suffer any repercussions. Granted Bobby will probably be pissed at her and she\u2019ll get passed over for Helen I suppose, but as a follower of Tiamat she technically has got the right to kill an outsider. It\u2019s just out of respect for Bobby that we accept you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so as soon as Bobby gets back, I\u2019m going to demand he marry me now.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well due to some sort of alignment of the stars on Friday I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be moved forward. Though, given how pissed Diana is about all this, I really wouldn\u2019t put it past her to just wait years to get revenge on you and make it look like an accident or make up some sort of bullshit about it being Tiamat\u2019s will or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what\u2026am I going to have to kill her to get any fucking peace?\u201d you blurt out.\n\nWilliam waves his hand down a bit as if to tell you to be quiet and looks around.\n\n\u201cShhh, don\u2019t talk that way out loud. You\u2019re not officially family yet. You talk like that around some of the others here and they\u2019ll throw you on the sacrificial altar. Hell, even Helen would probably go tell on you for talking like that.\u201d William says.\n\u201cWhat the hell? What about Bobby? Doesn\u2019t his leadership mean anything?!\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, he\u2019s very observant of certain rules and rituals. As much as he loves you, I don\u2019t even he would be able to help if you actually killed Diana.\u201d\n\u201cWell I gotta do something! I can\u2019t just sit around with a thumb up my ass constantly looking over my shoulder thinking Diana\u2019s going to do something to me.\u201d\n\u201cI know and I get it. (Sigh) Quite frankly if I was running things, I\u2019d go back to the old ways of Tiamat where we had less rules and ritual and more adherence to primal urges. What I\u2019d do is have you and Diana enter a steel cage and nobody left until one of you was dead, but that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Glad to know I\u2019d be better off under a more anarchic regime.\u201d You say with a tone of defeat.\n\nWilliam exhales deeply and then speaks.\n\n\u201cWell blondie, this is how I see it. You can either hold out until Friday after which point you can probably get rid of Diana a little easier or at least with less repercussions. Or you can, shall we say\u2026find an opportunity before then. I\u2019m not saying anymore, but if you really feel like you\u2019re in immediate danger then you know what to do.\u201d\n\nWith those words, William leaves you alone to ponder his advice.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take care of Diana", "result": "You get up and decide you need to take things into your own hands.

As you\u2019re looking around for where Diana\u2019s room is, you hear some voices and start heading towards them since they sound familiar.\n\nThe closer you get and you recognize one of the voices as Helen. The louder voice with the abusive tone can only be Diana.\n\n\u201cDiana, please try to calm yourself\u2026\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cCalm myself? Are you a fucking idiot?! That fucking bitch is an outsider and you\u2019re seriously okay with that?! You\u2019re okay with her taking Bobby away?\u201d Diana replies.\n\u201cBut she isn\u2019t taking him away, he\u2019ll still be here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHelen, you\u2019re a f\u2026WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM? GET THE FUCK OUT!\u201d Diana says when she sees you enter.\n\nHelen turns her head and sees you and she looks scared about what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026um hey Suzy\u2026I really don\u2019t think this is a good time\u2026\u201d Helen remarks and tries to get in between you and Diana who is already making steps towards you.\n\nYou didn\u2019t necessarily plan on Helen being here, but given how she\u2019s been living in fear of Diana for years, you\u2019re fairly certain you can angle that in your favor. You plan is fairly simple. You\u2019re going to \u201capologize\u201d but you know Diana is going to just start a fight again and in the process you\u2019re going to do damage she\u2019s going to be less likely to walk away from.\n\nYou\u2019ve already clashed with her once, she wasn\u2019t nearly as tough as she makes out and you\u2019re tougher than you actually thought you were.\n\nSurvival of the fittest is going to play out very soon.\n\n\u201cDiana, like I said before I didn\u2019t come here to fight. I\u2019ve just come to apologize if I offended you downstairs. I should\u2019ve realized this is your home and I had no right to insult you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd like I said before I\u2019m not interested in anything you\u2019ve got to say you fucking man stealing cunt! Now get the fuck out of here before Bobby comes home to a corpse bride!\u201d\n\nHelen at this point is practically pushing you out the door, but you\u2019re not moving.\n\n\u201cDiana, are you seriously going to threaten my life again after I\u2019m trying to make peace?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSuzy, please get out of here\u2026\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cBITCH I DON\u2019T WANT PEACE WITH YOU! YOU STOLE MY BOBBY AWAY RAAAAAAGH!\u201d Diana screams and charges at you. Somehow Helen manages to duck and squeeze out of the way before she\u2019s tackled along with you.\n\nDiana is now fighting with a fury you didn\u2019t see downstairs. While she was certainly filled with rage before, now it seems like she\u2019s possessed. You catch two blows to the face before you manage to push her back and land a kick to her stomach.\n\nHelen helplessly stands nearby calling for you both to stop, but neither of you are listening. Nearby vases are smashed, knick-knacks are knock over and even small pieces of furniture are damaged.\n\nEventually Diana pushes you backwards and then runs back into her room. You waste no time in chasing after her only to find that she\u2019s attempting to grab a large dagger from under her bed.\n\nShe slashes at you with it, but misses and you land a kick to her face. You then grab her and slam her into a desk causing her to drop her knife.\n\nYou go to pick it up, but Diana prevents you from doing so by crashing her bruised body into yours. The pair of you roll on the floor some more until you finally get the upper hand again and knock Diana into her window and partially through it.\n\nDiana groans in pain, but doesn\u2019t move. The top part of her body dangles outside, and her lower back is no doubt impaled on some of the broken glass. It\u2019ll be a simple matter of you just picking up her legs and pushing her out.\n\nOr at least it would if Helen wasn\u2019t around.\n\n\u201cStop it! Stop it please! Don\u2019t kill her! She\u2019s my sister!\u201d Helen shouts.\n\u201cHelen, this bitch has been abusing you for YEARS. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for her bullying to end? Come on Helen, you know your life would be better without her. Come on, just let everyone know this was purely in self defense. You know this is the right thing.\u201d You say.\n\nHelen looks around a moment and bites her lip. She\u2019s very unsure, but eventually she complies.\n\n\u201c\u2026okay\u2026just do it.\u201d she says and turns her head away.\n\nYou smile and go to pick up Diana\u2019s legs. You knew Helen would side against her sister.\n\nAs you push Diana out the window, that\u2019s when you realize Helen\u2019s sided against you as well. You feel a sharp pain go straight into your back. The shock causes you to temporarily unable to catch your breath as you try to reach for whatever it is that just got plunged into you.\n\nYou turn around just in time to see Helen give you a hefty shove.\n\n\u201cSorry Suzy.\u201d She says and you fall out the window.\n\nThe thing is, you may have possibly still survived the fall, but unfortunately landing on your back with a big knife in it, drives it completely through the front of your chest.\n\nAs you lay next to Diana\u2019s corpse, gurgling blood and struggling to breathe you soon follow her in death.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Keep a low profile", "result": "As much you\u2019d actually like to get Diana out of the picture, it probably would be best to just keep to yourself for the rest of the day. At least until Bobby gets back. In fact you think about calling him about this, but you decide it would be better to discuss something like this in person.\n\nYou head back to your room and lock the door. So much for being \u201csocial\u201d today.\n\nYou spend most of your time doing what you used to do in your basement, which actually suits you just fine. Though in between your computer game downtime (Sadly no Internet here), you also do more thinking about your future here.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Diana, you\u2019re going to have to do something about; it\u2019s also this whole Tiamat religion. You wonder if you\u2019re going to have to sacrifice people. You aren\u2019t even sure if you have it in you to kill Diana in cold blood (Maybe in self defense though) how are you going to kill an innocent person?\n\nYou also are wondering about Bobby\u2019s desire to have children and how that\u2019s going to go. While you\u2019ve never thought about being a mother, that\u2019s actually one of your lesser concerns.\n\nBobby\u2019s family has a \u201ctradition\u201d of interbreeding. As fucked up as your family was, there was never any of THAT going on and you\u2019re not exactly comfortable with the idea of your offspring having sex with each other\u2026and just HOW young is that encouraged anyway?\n\n\u201cGoddamnit Suzy, you really got yourself into a mess.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nBut its done now and you\u2019re just going to have to muddle through. You briefly ponder escape, but you\u2019re fairly certain that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea even if you did manage to get out of the compound.\n\nNo, your best plan for now is to speak to Bobby about all this. Surely you\u2019ve got some influence over him.\n\nHours pass and eventually when night starts to fall there\u2019s a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cHey, Suzy. It\u2019s Bobby, why is the door locked?\u201d you hear Bobby ask.\n\u201cBecause I already had a fight with your bitch of a sister once today and I was avoiding any more potential conflict. Hold on\u2026\u201d you say and go to open the door.\n\nYou open the door and Bobby goes to hug you, though you barely return the favor.\n\n\u201cSuzy, shit, you should put something on that.\u201d He remarks about your face bruising.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, stop! Don\u2019t touch it. (Sigh) Look we\u2019ve got A LOT to discuss. First of which is why the hell did you leave without telling me?\u201d\n\u201cI actually didn\u2019t plan on leaving at all, but I remembered a few things that I left back at the house that I thought we should have here so I figured I\u2019d make a quick trip there which turned out to be a cluster fuck. Shit is getting worse in town. Anyway, I saw no reason to bother you since I figured you wouldn\u2019t even bother leaving the room. I had it planned for Helen to come up to serve you food at appointed hours, of course she mentioned the fight when I finally got in and she wasn\u2019t sure if she should bother you. Now I already heard some of it from the rest of the family and especially Diana, now why don\u2019t you tell me what happened exactly?\u201d\n\nYou recount the event to Bobby and then add your own displeasure about his sister in general.\n\n\u201cI know, I know, I\u2019ll straighten it out.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cYou said that before and that bitch is still trying to kill me! You better do something about her permanently.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhoa, hold on now. I know you\u2019re upset, but let\u2019s rein it in a bit. I mean it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea on your part to provoke her.\u201d\n\nYour jaw nearly drops.\n\n\u201cBobby, I KNOW you just didn\u2019t take her fucking side. Because if you are\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m NOT taking her fucking side! I\u2019m just saying my sister is a lot of bark most of the time and she only reacts when someone really provokes her.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so what? Am I just supposed to put up with Diana\u2019s abuse in silence? Be a doormat like Helen? NO! I had enough of that shit from Kelly, I didn\u2019t come here just to repeat that cycle again! You told me you were the fucking leader of your family, shouldn\u2019t you just be able to snap your fingers and they have to fall in fucking line?\u201d\n\nBobby just hangs his head and slumps down on a chair.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Alright, alright, you made your point and you\u2019re right. You shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that sort of treatment. I\u2019ll handle Diana, but from now on don\u2019t get into a fight with her if she\u2019s being a bitch. Just ignore her.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s going to be an option if she pushes me too much, which brings me to some other issues.\u201d\n\u201cOther issues? What the else fucking happened while I was gone?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, but I\u2019ve been doing some thinking. If I\u2019m going to be popping out children, I refuse to have them involved in some kiddie porn ring. I\u2019m not having it! I can look past a lot, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m drawing the fucking line.\u201d You say with authority.\n\nNow Bobby\u2019s jaw drops.\n\n\u201cKiddie porn? By Tiamat\u2019s Twenty Tits, what the hell do you think goes on here Suzy?\u201d Bobby says being genuinely offended.\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t fucking know! I mean I know you guys participate in human sacrifice and commit incest like its no big deal! I mean you and your sister had to start experimenting with each other at an early age and taught that it was perfectly fine to do so. What the hell am I supposed to think?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve just asked you know. You could\u2019ve asked about Tiamat and all this other shit before jumping to your own conclusions. I\u2019ve tried on many occasions to actually enlighten you on my religion but (Sigh) nevermind. We\u2019ll get to THAT later, first let me allay your fears of any rampant pedophilia going on here of which there ISN\u2019T. Or at least under my watch there won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that it has happened in your family.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to lie and say that maybe sometimes that shit HAS happened in the past with other family members, but I\u2019m sure my family isn\u2019t the only one that has had such elements in it. I mean what about your family? Like your old Uncle Ed?\u201d\n\u201cHey my Uncle Ed wasn\u2019t a kiddie fiddler, he was just a plain old serial killer.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh well, I guess he was a saint then, look my point is, I think you\u2019ve got the wrong impression about all of us. All right, it\u2019s true my family did tend to interbreed a bit more in the past and yeah by and large we don\u2019t see it as some great taboo. However it wasn\u2019t like it was a standard procedure to get the kids to start playing doctor at an early age. To be honest, I probably only grew close to Diana because my dad was a fucking tyrant who barely let any of us socialize with others our own age. Then after mom died\u2026who WASN\u2019T related to my dad by the way, Diana and me just grew even closer and\u2026well I won\u2019t go into anymore because I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hear it. I\u2019m just saying it wasn\u2019t like my dad was telling us to fuck one another or else. If anything, my dad probably was a bigger prude than some Christian fundies. If he had known what was going on, he probably would\u2019ve horse whipped the pair of us for distracting ourselves from Tiamat\u2019s glory or some shit.\u201d\n\nBobby holds up his hand before you can interrupt.\n\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m saying is that any children we have aren\u2019t going to be forced to have sex with each other or anyone else. That\u2019s not part of the plan nor will it ever be.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, glad to hear it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, are there any other concerns we need to discuss?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t get married sooner, like tomorrow for instance.\u201d\n\u201cBecause this Friday is perfect. I\u2019ve already got things planned out.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m the bride, shouldn\u2019t I be planning all this out? In fact why do I have practically no say in this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026look\u2026argh, fine besides wanting the wedding moved up what else do you want?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I dunno. Okay, I guess I don\u2019t have any ideas. That\u2019s not the point though, it\u2019s the principle that I want my voice to be heard.\u201d\n\u201cWell trust me, after today it\u2019s been more than heard. Look, if you DO have any requests, let me know because we can accommodate you\u2026except pushing up the date. It really needs to be on Friday. Why do you want it pushed up anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWilliam told me I\u2019m in danger with Diana until I\u2019m actually married to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you not to worry about Diana anymore. I\u2019m going to take care of that. And I wouldn\u2019t listen to my cousin anyway. He\u2019s a bit of a shit stirrer. Now is there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I guess that\u2019s all the major things for now. So um, how was your day in town?\u201d\n\nAt this point Bobby tells you about his trip back and forth to his house and while to an extent it was exciting, he was glad to get back home to you.\n\nBobby also goes on to tell you that a few more family members apparently arrived while he was gone and you were in self-isolation.\n\n\u201cGreat, more people to hate me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Tomorrow, I\u2019m definitely not going anywhere so I\u2019ll be around to introduce you to everyone proper. You\u2019re not going to get the Diana treatment by all of them. To be honest, what little the rest have seen of you, you\u2019re ahead in the polls. Helen likes you of course. You managed to impress William and some of the kids thought you were, in their words a pretty blonde lady that was beating up their mean sister Diana or aunt Diana in some cases. Even my cousin Brandon said you seemed okay and he barely ever gives an opinion without his wife telling him what to think.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s something I suppose.\u201d\n\nAt this point Bobby goes back to reassuring you that everything will be fine and the pair of you spend the remainder of the night together. Eventually as the hours grow late the pair of you go to sleep.\n\nStill, you can\u2019t help but have your doubts and concerns even though Bobby alleviated a few of them. You still think you\u2019re going to have to take matters into your own hands rather than rely solely on Bobby.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world cucumber eating championship!

He doesn\u2019t say much, but that\u2019s probably because he\u2019s trying to avoid an argument just before the pair of you are supposed to be \u201cformally\u201d meeting his people.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d You say when you finish getting dressed, Bobby nods and the pair of you leave the room.\n\nBobby finally speaks to you again as you walk and talk, though you\u2019re mostly just listening to him going on about the other family members you haven\u2019t met yet and how to best handle them. To be honest, you\u2019ve already made up your mind that you\u2019re going to treat them how they treat you.\n\nEventually you get to the large living area where you see familiar faces along with unknown ones. William sits in a large comfy looking chair and nods at you, taking a drink. You see that Brandon guy with a slightly chubby woman, you\u2019re guessing that\u2019s his wife Veronica. They both greet you, but nothing more than that.\n\nYou also see three new people who are more of Bobby\u2019s cousins. They all introduce themselves, but much like Brandon and Veronica, they don\u2019t do much more than that. You don\u2019t get the impression any of this is personal either. Aaron doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to be here at all. Ronald and Denise look more interested in each other than anyone else at the moment.\n\nYou then see Helen again who looks like she has her hands full with several boys and girls. She still manages to wave hi to you though. The kids themselves look at you, but seem to be pre-occupied with bickering with each other.\n\n\u201cHow many of those are your siblings again?\u201d you whisper to Bobby.\n\u201cOh just the three. The oldest boy there Jordan and the twins Aiden and Nadia. The other half are Brandon and his wife\u2019s kids.\u201d He answers.\n\u201cUm, shouldn\u2019t they be looking after them then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they do all the time and are just taking advantage of the extra support system they have now. I mean they trust Helen to look after them and Helen said she was happy to do it. Besides, everyone is family here so it hardly matters who is looking after them directly.\u201d\n\nWhile you haven\u2019t known these people long, you know Helen\u2019s personality well enough that she\u2019d agree to anything since she seems to be the family doormat.\n\nYou don\u2019t see Diana, but someone mentions she\u2019s in the kitchen making food for everyone.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go do this now, because I don\u2019t want to do it later. I\u2019m going to go speak with Diana and straighten everything out and make it clear there is to be no more dissension in the family today.\u201d\n\u201cHm, while you\u2019re at it make sure she\u2019s not putting rat poison in my food.\u201d You remark.\n\nBobby heads into the kitchen leaving you alone with the rest of his family. Having little else to do, you make the attempt to be social.\n\nBrandon and Veronica are more talkative than the rest. They ask you a few questions and you answer. They don\u2019t seem to really care too much about you though. As far as they\u2019re concerned it isn\u2019t their place to disapprove of you even if you caused such a negative reaction in them, which apparently you don\u2019t.\n\nYou almost get the impression they find you more boring than anything else, which unfortunately due to your basement dwelling past might very well be a fair assessment. But you\u2019ll take apathy because it\u2019s better than hatred.\n\nBobby\u2019s other cousins are more of a mixed bag. Aaron barely speaks to you at all and he\u2019s pretty snappish when he does. He seems like he\u2019s a pent up ball of nerves since he\u2019s tapping his foot and moving one of his hands the entire time. In fact the more of an effort that you try to speak to him, the more hostile he starts to look. The moment you get the feeling of his eyes burning a hole in you the more you decide to move on.\n\nBy the time you get to Ronald and Denise, they\u2019re making out, so you don\u2019t even bother.\n\nWhich leaves you with William and Helen, the latter of which has already left the room with all the little kids of this family presumably to be out of the way as usual. William on the other hand is still relaxing in a chair at the far end of the room and watching something on TV.\n\nWell at least you know those two are friendly with you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go speak to William", "result": "While Helen would probably appreciate your company, you don\u2019t really feel like dealing with all the little kids that are going to be hanging around her so William it is.\n\nYou head over and sit in a chair near him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing really, mostly Ground Zero ads. These fuckers are really raking in the money preying upon people\u2019s fears like this. Gotta say though, if I was the corporate type, I\u2019d sure want a piece of that action.\u201d William remarks.\n\u201cYou believe its all a scam?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well as always the best lies have truth mixed in with them. A day of mass destruction is definitely coming. I believe that. The writing is on the wall, but I know damn well GZ isn\u2019t the savior from that. Nothing is except yourself and how strong your will to live is. Yep, dark days are coming and it\u2019s going to weed out the weak so only the strong survive.\u201d\n\u201cLike the Morningstars.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well some of us I suppose. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure about some of the people here. I mean I love \u2018em because they\u2019re family, but\u2026(sigh) well take Brandon over there. The guy would be killed and eaten in a completely savage world with no laws. His wife too. I dare say even you might thrive better.\u201d\n\u201cThanks\u2026I think.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYou see, this place. This compound that Bobby has tried to bring all the family to\u2026it\u2019s just another form of restriction. The day is coming soon where unbridled chaos is going to become a reality and Bobby\u2026Tiamat bless him is misguidedly still clinging to ways that should be abandoned. Now is not really the time to hide in a fortress like some 80s cult. Now is the time we should be out there embracing the chaos like Tiamat intended.\u201d\n\nLooks like there is a bit of dissension in the family that doesn\u2019t involve you. At least not directly.\n\n\u201cI thought you supported Bobby.\u201d You ask.\n\u201c(sigh) Yeah\u2026I thought I did. I mean I still do. I respect WHAT he\u2019s trying to accomplish and his plan. And I\u2019m obviously not going to overthrow his power or anything\u2026but I just don\u2019t think this is going to be for me. Y\u2019know? I\u2019ve always been a bit more of a drifter and after being here a few days, I\u2019m starting to get really bored. That fight you had with Diana was about the most interesting thing that\u2019s happened here and while I\u2019d certainly like to see the outcome of that drama, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to stick around long enough to find out. I\u2019m going to be heading out, along with Aaron.\u201d William says.\n\u201cAaron? That guy sitting in the corner who looks like a ball of pent up energy?\u201d\n\u201cYep. He\u2019s even more anxious to leave more than I am. I think he only showed up to meet up with me since he doesn\u2019t have a vehicle and it\u2019s always good to have at least one person to watch your back.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026when are you leaving?\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as possible, in fact I\u2019ll probably talk to Bobby, before I do. He\u2019s going to be disappointed, but I know he\u2019ll understand\u2026so how about you?\u201d\n\u201cHow about me what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, are YOU comfortable here? I mean you haven\u2019t been here long and you already got into a major fight with Diana and nobody here seems all that close to you. Polite perhaps, but you\u2019re not exactly bonding here.\u201d William says.\n\u201cWell that might take time, besides, still better than my own family so far.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, well what about this wedding? From what I know, Bobby sort of sprung that proposal on you. You okay with that?\u201d\n\u201cI love Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know you love Bobby. I don\u2019t doubt that, but that\u2019s not necessarily a good reason to get married. Hell, love can sometimes be the WORST reason to get married. Also if I know Bobby, he\u2019s probably already got it in head that you\u2019ll be popping out a whole mess o\u2019 babies.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yeah, I actually already addressed some of that yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the wedding sacrifice??\n\u201cWedding sacrifice?\u201d\n\nWilliam pauses for a moment.\n\n\u201cYou mean to tell me, he hasn\u2019t told you about the wedding sacrifice?\u201d William whispers to you.\n\u201cNo! He\u2026he\u2019s not going to mutilate me is he?\u201d you ask in a hushed tone.\n\u201cNo! No, no, no nothing like that. I just can\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t told you considering it\u2019s pretty important and he\u2019s pretty big on all this ritual crap to Tiamat.\u201d\n\u201cWell what is it?!\u201d\n\u201cNothing, you just have to sacrifice someone on an altar in the name of Tiamat to prove your allegiance and dedication to the family.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the rules. I mean personally I think just a simple prayer while bludgeoning something to death in an alley works just as well, but like I said, Bobby\u2019s all into the rituals. Guess he takes after his dad that way, but then again so do I. It is said that most sons become like their fathers after all.\u201d\n\nThose last words by William aren\u2019t very endearing ones given what a fanatic Bobby\u2019s father was. Still your main concern is this human sacrifice thing. You didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d have to do it, in fact you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re going to be able. While you\u2019ve had murderous thoughts about Diana, that\u2019s a little different. For one, you haven\u2019t acted on them, and two that\u2019s self-defense. You don\u2019t know if you have it in you to murder some innocent person in cold blood, let alone to some cult goddess you don\u2019t even believe in.\n\n\u201cI take it, you aren\u2019t really enthused about the possibility of killing someone. Well someone who isn\u2019t immediately attacking you at any rate.\u201d William says.\n\u201cUm, well\u2026I wasn\u2019t expecting to.\u201d\n\u201cSee, this is something Bobby REALLY should\u2019ve told you before dragging you up here. (Sigh) You\u2019re supposed to be the love of his life and he should KNOW if you\u2019re completely in sync with him. I mean not everyone is cut out to be a member of one of Tiamat\u2019s chosen and that\u2019s fine, but again he really should\u2019ve asked you first.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026wait, where are they getting this\u2026um sacrifice?\u201d\n\u201cThe sacrifice? Oh got a whole mess of them in the basement in the left wing of this place. We captured a bunch of folks and locked them in cages before starting to move the family in\u2026and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s another thing you didn\u2019t know about.\u201d William says noticing your surprise at this revelation too.\n\nYou\u2019re just silent. Combined with the mess with Diana, the wedding and all this new info, you\u2019re starting to seriously wonder if you\u2019re strong enough to go through with all this now.\n\nAt this point William leans over to you and keeps a low tone.\n\n\u201cLook, I can see that you\u2019re probably not cut out for this life and as I said, that\u2019s perfectly fine. But Bobby\u2026 well I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take it well if you backed out now or worse, backed out on the wedding day.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d You say with your voice starting to get a little quivery.\n\u201cShhh, okay. Look, it\u2019s not too late to leave this place. I\u2019d be willing to take you with me, and I\u2019ll drop you off wherever you want. Of course we\u2019d have to do it secretly.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cWell, my van is the dark blue one out front. Here\u2019s the keys.\u201d William says and hands you some keys, which surprises you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust you. Besides, that big gate has to be opened up first anyway. All you have to do is hide in the can, until me and Aaron leave which shouldn\u2019t be long. Just make sure you keep the doors unlocked so we can get in.\u201d William says.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they going to notice I\u2019m gone?\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is a big place, so if you went missing for a little while people would probably think you\u2019re either just wandering the house or maybe back in your room before suspicion arose. I\u2019d also be willing to make up a story if it came to that. In any case, if you\u2019re going to do it, we need to do it now.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with William", "result": "The more you think about it, the more you realize that William\u2019s probably right. You\u2019re just going from one fucked up family to another and you certainly aren\u2019t cut out to kill someone in the name of a religion you don\u2019t even believe in.\n\nThis is your one chance to back out of this mistake and you\u2019re going to take it. You aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019re going to go after you leave, but at least you won\u2019t be trapped like you are here.\n\n\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll take?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t take long actually. Just nonchalantly leave now and like I said make your way to the dark blue van. There are a lot of tarps and blankets you can hide under if you really want to play it safe, but as soon as me and Aaron are in that van, we\u2019re leaving even if we have to drive through the gate, but again that shouldn\u2019t be necessary.\u201d\n\nNodding at William you get up and make your way out of the room, which from you can tell, nobody is even paying attention to you.\n\nYou spend half of your time constantly looking around, to make sure nobody is following you or anything like that, but again you\u2019re in the clear. You manage to make it out the house and into the van in secret.\n\nThe van itself is pretty old, definitely a relic from several decades past. William has a variety of tools scattered all over the back of the van and you see the tarps and blankets in the back like William mentioned. They don\u2019t look the cleanest, but you figure you might as well hide under them in the meantime. No point in risking someone wandering outside and catching a glimpse of you through the van window.\n\nSeconds, minutes and you think an hour passes before you start to hear voices outside. One of them sounds like William.\n\nThe driver\u2019s door opens and you hear William more distinctly.\n\n\u201cOkay Aaron, you go open it, I\u2019ll pick you up as we\u2019re going out.\u201d He says and then shuts the door.\n\nThen you hear some squeaking around on the front seat.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, you there under all that stuff? I sort of need my keys back to start the van up.\u201d He says.\n\nYou peak your head out and out stretch your arm with the keys and William takes them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re almost the clear blondie.\u201d He says starting up the van and begins driving.\n\nA few moment later and you hear another door opening and slamming shut.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of this prison.\u201d You hear Aaron say in a gruff tone.\n\nAnd with that, William hits the gas and begins driving at a faster pace and you slowly start getting out from under your \u201chiding spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll clear blondie.\u201d William says.\n\u201cYeah I thought we were well on our way now. So did you have any trouble?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTrouble? Nah, by the time Bobby was done speaking with Diana he seemed so emotionally drained that he barely tried to convince me to stay. He basically just told me to leave and wished me and Aaron well. He didn\u2019t see us out though, he sent Ronald to shut the gate when we left.\u201d\n\u201cSo Bobby didn\u2019t ask where I was?\u201d\n\u201cActually he did, but I said I wasn\u2019t sure where you went and that you wandered off a long time ago, probably back to your room. He didn\u2019t seem to rush off to go looking for you though. I\u2019m not exactly sure how that conversation went with Diana, but I know she went running out of the kitchen in tears and like I said he was pretty down.\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t exactly sure how to feel about that. You can\u2019t imagine Bobby\u2019s going to be in a better mood when he realizes you\u2019re gone.\n\n\u201cShit, maybe I should\u2019ve stayed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a little late for that now. Look, he\u2019ll be fine\u2026well okay maybe he won\u2019t be fine when he realizes you\u2019re gone, but he\u2019ll get over it. He\u2019ll most likely just get back with Diana out of duty and their history together and she\u2019ll take him back, because he\u2019s everything in the world to her. And in time they\u2019ll live happily ever after, more or less. Nothing\u2019s perfect, nor should it be.\u201d\n\u201cChaos always finds a way.\u201d Aaron adds in creepy tone. You realize he hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off of you which is a little concerning.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah\u2026so what\u2019s next?\u201d you ask wearily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next? Well, that\u2019s an interesting question. Before you were coming along, I\u2019m pretty sure Aaron here wanted to go indulge in some of the looting going on in town. Can\u2019t say I was opposed to that idea either. I guess we could still go do that since I imagine you probably want to go back home right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s NOT what you said William! You said we were using this blonde bitch and tossing her violated corpse out the fucking van!\u201d Aaron suddenly blurts out.\n\nNow you back up and freeze. Terror fills every inch of your body.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) By Tiamat\u2019s Twenty Tits, do you have any fucking impulse control Aaron? Now this is going to be harder than it needs to be.\u201d William says without even stopping his driving.\n\nYou start looking around the van and eyeing one of the many tools laying the floor, but before you can even reach any of them, Aaron pulls a pistol.\n\n\u201cDO NOT even think about it bitch!\u201d he exclaims and is about to get up out his seat and head toward you, but William grabs his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAaron will you calm the fuck down for just one fucking second. Now you\u2019re going to get yer dick in that soon, we both are, but I\u2019d like to at least drive far enough away from the damn compound and find a nice place to park where we can do this with minor possible distractions. I\u2019d think you\u2019d like to take your time with this one right?\u201d\n\nAaron glares at William, but doesn\u2019t argue any more. He still continues to hold the gun on you though. At this moment you feel like a fucking idiot. Not do you wish you never left the compound, but you also wish you never left home. You start to cry and sniffle.\n\n\u201c(sob) Please you don\u2019t have to do this\u2026\u201d you whimper.\n\u201cAwwww\u2026I thought you were stronger than that Suzy and weren\u2019t gonna get too weepy about this. (Sigh) Besides that\u2019s not gonna do ya any good anyway blondie. This is going to happen. However, Aaron here has been a little dramatic about the whole situation as usual. I never said we were going to throw your corpse out this van. I mean maybe we will if you put up a fight\u2026but since I\u2019ve grown to like you a little, I\u2019m thinking if you just submit and let us do what we\u2019re gonna do without any problems, well I\u2019ll be happy to take you back home or drop you off anywhere else in town. Your choice of course.\u201d William explains matter of factly.\n\nEither get raped and survive, or die. Those are your choices and those are no kind of choices at all, but it\u2019s what\u2019s been given to you.\n\nYou start to think about the pair of them violating you and it\u2019s starts to make you sick. In fact you even start hyperventilating and coughing up, though you don\u2019t actually vomit. Aaron makes some threat about how if you don\u2019t stop it, he\u2019s going to shove his dick in your mouth and give you something real to choke on.\n\nAre they going to do it one after another or are they going to \u201ckebob\u201d you like pig on a spit? Are they going to sodomize you or slap you around while fucking you? Are they going to just kill you anyway after they\u2019ve had their jollies?\n\nAs the van keeps driving through the woods, your mind keeps racing about how maybe you might be able to survive this if you just give in\u2026\n\nAnd you can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t just let these fuckers shove their dicks in you like some meat with holes in it. You have to at least try to resist. You might die, but the alternative is even worse. You don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to live with yourself.\n\nMustering up all your inner strength and recomposing yourself, you start taking off your clothing, which immediately gets Aaron\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my clothes, I mean that\u2019s what you guys want right?\u201d you say still sniffling a bit.\n\nAt this point William\u2019s head turns sideways so he can see.\n\n\u201cWell glad to see you\u2019ve gotten with the program so fast. Shit, you got some nice tits on you. I mean I figured you did, but seeing them uncovered is even better. Can\u2019t wait to see \u2018em up close. I bet you made Bobby REALLY happy.\u201d William remarks.\n\u201cShe better make ME really happy by letting me fuck her in the ass!\u201d Aaron exclaims.\n\u201cPretty sure she\u2019s gonna let us do whatever, right Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you both want William.\u201d You say in defeat.\n\nEventually you strip off the last bit of your clothing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d you say meekly and spread your legs wide giving Aaron an eyeful of your lady bits.\n\nWilliam looks again and almost does a double take.\n\n\u201cShit, well hold on girl, we\u2019ll get to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck that, I\u2019m not waiting any longer.\u201d Aaron says and is already got his hard cock out in one hand and still holding his pistol in the other.\n\nAaron\u2019s already on top of you before William can stop him this time and he gets the head of his dick partially in you before you grab a nearby awl on the floor of the van and stab him in the side of the neck with it repeatedly.\n\nAaron yells in pain, and tries to shoot you in the head, but he only succeeds in blowing off your ear and hitting you in the shoulder before he drops the pistol entirely and collapses completely on top of you.\n\n\u201cOh fuck it.\u201d William remarks and the van comes to a screeching halt.\n\nScreaming in pain yourself, you try to grab for Aaron\u2019s pistol, but William manages to get it from you first. Bleeding, scared, tears in your eyes and partially deaf, and trying to catch your breath from this whole ordeal. You stare at William who is looking down at you with gun in hand. You try your best to give him a look of defiance even though all you want to do is cry.\n\n\u201cI probably would\u2019ve done the same thing blondie. Protecting yer virtue to the end. While I\u2019m disappointed I won\u2019t be experiencing some of what Bobby got, I\u2019m glad to see you were a fighter after all. Don\u2019t worry, unlike some in my family, I\u2019m not into necrophilia.\u201d William remarks.\n\nAnd then he shoots you in the face.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay at the compound", "result": "And suddenly all your instincts cry out \u201cDANGER.\u201d You also remember Bobby telling you that you shouldn\u2019t listen to William since he\u2019s a shit stirrer and he\u2019s certainly doing a good job here.\n\nWilliam seems too eager to help you given everything you\u2019ve heard him spout about survival of the fittest and wanting to embrace pure chaos. Technically you still aren\u2019t \u201cfamily\u201d and if you aren\u2019t with Bobby, what\u2019s stopping him from just gutting you and tossing your corpse along side the road or worse when you leave the compound? And that\u2019s not even counting that creepy Aaron guy who is going to be travelling with him.\n\nEven if he is on the up and up, you have no idea where to go. Going back home isn\u2019t really an option, in fact going back to town sounds like a bad idea all around given what Bobby told you yesterday. And you certainly don\u2019t want to be travelling around with William while he raises hell, since again he\u2019s libel to \u201craise hell\u201d on you.\n\nYou still don\u2019t know about the whole wedding sacrifice, but you do know that running away with William isn\u2019t the answer. You\u2019re going to just have to deal with your situation another way.\n\nYou take a deep breath and hand William his keys back.\n\n\u201cI thank you for the offer William, but I\u2019m staying.\u201d You say.\n\nWilliam looks a little surprised at first, but then his face turns to a smile.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Tiamat certainly sent a blessing to Bobby when he met you. I hope he realizes it.\u201d William remarks.\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be reminding him.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOf that I have no doubt. Okay. Well it was nice meeting you Suzy, and may Tiamat\u2019s blessed chaos always swing in your favor.\u201d William says and then gets up. He makes a head gesture to Aaron who apparently has been watching the pair of you the entire time.\n\nThe pair of them leave the room and you get the impression they\u2019re not going to bother telling Bobby they\u2019re leaving the compound either. Perhaps William figures you\u2019ll mention to Bobby that he attempted to whisk you away, along with confronting him about the wedding stuff, which you will most certainly be doing.\n\nAs soon as you can at any rate since Bobby is still talking with Diana, or at least he was until you see her running out of the kitchen and trying to cover her face. It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s crying or at least about to.\n\nBobby soon comes out of the kitchen as well. He doesn\u2019t look in the best of moods.\n\n\u201cFood\u2019s in the kitchen, serve yourselves.\u201d He says. Nobody says anything, except Helen who asks what\u2019s going on when she enters the room. Bobby just waves her away and tells her to see to the children as usual then he slumps down by the chair next to you. Bobby\u2019s family at this point heads into the kitchen, not wishing to\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t look so down about it. And what\u2019s done exactly? Did she get the message? Am I still going to have to worry about her?\u201d\n\u201cNo. For the last time no. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. I made it quite clear that it\u2019s over between her and I. So clear in fact that she probably hates me more than you now.\u201d\n\u201cI seriously doubt that, but do you think it\u2019s wise to let her run around this house if she hates you?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Suzy, I\u2019m not throwing her out and I\u2019m not killing her okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay fine. If you want to live dangerously\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, how about this. If you REALLY hate her that much, then why don\u2019t YOU kill her? Seriously, you have my permission if it will get you to stop bitching about it.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t really expect Bobby to say that, but then\u2026\n\n\u201cWell I suppose that would make the wedding sacrifice a lot easier.\u201d You say which causes an eyebrow raise by Bobby.\n\n\u201cGreat, so you know. Who told you? Wait, I know. William did right?\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cYeah, I think he hoped to scare me into leaving with him\u2026speaking of which I think he and Aaron left.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cFigures. (Sigh) I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m bothering trying to hold this family together. Most of them aren\u2019t even here. One of them hates me, and the rest aren\u2019t exactly sterling examples of Tiamat\u2019s Chosen. In fact the ones that are here are probably here because it\u2019s safe and filled with enough supplies to live comfortably.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\u201cNothing I suppose, but supporting about bunch of freeloaders wasn\u2019t really part of my plan to honor Tiamat.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe you need to change your damn plan. I mean its still early, but if you really feel like someone isn\u2019t pulling their weight around here, then you need to just kick their asses out, family or not. I mean you\u2019re the boss around here and your word is supposed to be law.\u201d\n\nBobby sits up a bit as you continue to speak.\n\n\u201cLook, you know you\u2019re a leader and you know the head of this family. So you can\u2019t give into all this self-doubt. You NEEDED to lay down the law to your sister Diana., but you know that\u2019s just going to be a temporary fix. Now I think you KNOW what you\u2019re going to have to do with her, but your past with her is preventing you from doing it, which is why you made your outburst about me doing it a few moments ago.\u201d\n\nBobby continues to listen intently.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not going to do it for you unless she gives me cause to, but she\u2019s going to have to be dealt with by our wedding day. Whether that means you exiling her ass or killing her, that\u2019s up to you. Love isn\u2019t one-sided Bobby, and if I\u2019m going to have to ultimately submit to your beliefs and everything that goes with it including murdering innocent people, well you\u2019re going to make a sacrifice to me as well. If not, well you can throw me on that slab and thrust that dagger in me and get it over with.\u201d\n\nBobby looks a little overwhelmed by your ultimatum. He\u2019s never heard you speak like this before and really; you\u2019re a little surprised you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying yourself. You\u2019re rolling the dice and betting everything here. You think you\u2019ve got the inner strength to go through with all this, you just hope that Bobby proves to be just as strong.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you are the love of my life and what you\u2019ve just told me just confirms that Tiamat\u2019s chaos did favor me when I met you. You\u2019re right. I know I have to do something more permanent with my sister Diana. I\u2019ll come to a decision tomorrow though. I think I need the rest of the day to recover from all the shit I\u2019ve already had to go through. It\u2019s not even night yet!\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay. I understand. Well, should we go eat with the rest of the family?\u201d\n\u201cMight as well.\u201d\n\nYou and Bobby briefly kiss each other and go join the rest of the family who have congregated in the dining area. None of them say anything to you or rather none of them ask any questions if everything is okay or anything. Diana isn\u2019t here and Bobby makes the announcement that Aaron and William have left and then tells Brandon when he\u2019s done eating, he can go check the front gate to make sure they closed it properly.\n\nThe remainder of the day is a bit out of the norm for you since you spend it mainly with Bobby\u2019s family. They\u2019re surprisingly really into board games. Unsurprisingly most of the board games seem to involve conquest or killing everyone else.\n\nWhile you never really played many board games before, you catch on quick thanks to your years of playing strategy games on your computer and its fun enough that it keeps your mind off other things. You even manage to win a game of Scorched Earth.\n\nDiana never joins in, and at one point Helen (who was playing separate games with the kids) goes to check on her out of concern, but she remains in her room.\n\nEventually you start to get tired of socializing and you feel you\u2019ve bonded enough with Bobby\u2019s family for one day so you return to your own room. Bobby tells Ronald to take watch for the night and goes with you.\n\nBefore you settle down for bed, you check your phone out of curiosity to see if anyone has tried to call you.\n\n\u201cSomebody call you?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cNah, though I didn\u2019t really expect anyone to. Pretty much says it all about my ties to my own family.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I think we both know you\u2019re already with your new family now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Still, I can\u2019t help but wonder how they\u2019re all dealing with the situation in town. Though who knows, maybe its calmed down now. Anyway, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d You say and get into bed.\n\nBobby follows and it doesn\u2019t take long before he\u2019s grabbing and grinding up against you. You return his affection and have pleasant round of passion before going to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world twelve inch salami eating championship! Let's all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe the sour cream off your lips\u2026 and you stand up and yell:\n\n\u201cAlright this is getting fucking insulting! For the past four nights now I\u2019ve been winning contests involving eating phallic shaped food. What the fuck is the symbolism here? That I\u2019m some whore that sucks cock all the time? For fuck\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve only had the one goddamn boyfriend and soon to be husband. If anything I\u2019m the exact opposite of a whore! So whoever or WHATEVER is trying to send a message to me needs to just come out and fucking say it.\u201d\n\nAnd with those words of indignation, your surroundings immediately change to that of a blasted wasteland. There is nothing around you save for burned out buildings in the distance and dead landscape. Reminds you a bit of a video game you once played.\n\n\u201cYou know, the entire world is soon going to look like this\u2026how I wish I could be young and alive to experience the uncertainty and chaos that is going to shape the years to follow.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou turn around and see Bobby\u2019s grandmother again. She\u2019s an old lady walking with a cane this time.\n\n\u201cBut enough about the future, let\u2019s talk about the present. You survived a lot longer than I thought you would, maybe you are worthy of my grandson after all. You even are starting to manipulate him a bit, that\u2019s good. The true leaders in Tiamat\u2019s service have always been women anyway. I swear if it wasn\u2019t for us prodding them in the right direction every now and then, most men would be content just jacking off to pass the time. Still, you aren\u2019t quite there yet. I think today should prove to quite interesting. Survive today and you might just meet Misty yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I want some answers, who the hell is Misty, and what\u2019s going to happen today?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough what\u2019s going to happen and as for Misty, well why don\u2019t you put some thought into it. I mean it\u2019s pretty simple even for you blondie.\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother replies with slight distain.\n\u201cWell what\u2019s deal with all these contests in my dreams?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I really don\u2019t know anything about that. If you\u2019re lucky and actually meet Misty, maybe you can ask her, but I just assumed you really liked dreaming about sucking dick...in a symbolic way I guess. Hmm, come to think of it this would explain why Bobby\u2019s so enamored with you. Maybe you aren\u2019t a whore blondie, but you sure got the mouth of one. It\u2019s almost as if it was a highway for oral sex.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take offense blondie. It\u2019s a good thing. Suck a man\u2019s dick right, and you can practically get him to do ANYTHING for you. I mean you got natural talent. Hell, maybe even Tiamat blessed you with it so you stood an equal chance against Diana. Now that girl, as much as she loves Bobby, she just can\u2019t suck a dick properly. Bad gag reflex, slightly oversized teeth, I dunno. Tiamat works in whimsical ways I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you even know all\u2026nevermind I don\u2019t want to hear anymore.\u201d You say.\n\nBobby\u2019s grandmother ignores you though and continues to speak.\n\n\u201cStill, Bobby always did have a slight obsession for blowjobs. He likes them a lot more than he\u2019s probably told you. He\u2019s a bit too much of a gentleman that way.\u201d\n\u201cGah! I\u2019m done listening!\u201d you shout feeling increasingly uncomfortable about hearing Bobby\u2019s grandmother talk about his sexual interests.\n\u201cOh, alright Miss Prude. I\u2019m rambling and it\u2019s time for you to go anyway. See ya Deep Throat!\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother cackles again and then raises her cane and all your surroundings go black\u2026\n\nAnd then you wake up.\n\n\u201cSomething bad is going to happen today.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\n(Then again why should today be any different from the rest of this week?)\n\nYou look around and see nobody in the room (Save for Bobby\u2019s grandmother\u2019s portrait staring like a gargoyle). Looks like Bobby woke up before you as usual. You look at the time on your phone and see you\u2019ve actually slept until the afternoon.\n\nWhile the normal thing for you to do would be to just stay in your room and avoid everyone, but given your recent dream, you think your best bet might be to be a little proactive today.\n\nAfter going through your usual routine of washing up and getting dressed you head down to the main living area where you know everyone usually gathers.\n\nBefore you get there you bump into Helen, who looks a bit harried and is carrying a pistol in one hand.\n\n\u201cThere you are, good. Saves me time. Bobby told me to go get you.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cWha\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAaron came back and he\u2019s threatening to drive an army truck through the front gate if we all don\u2019t leave the compound. He claims that we\u2019re defying Tiamat by not embracing the chaos outside. Bobby\u2019s been trying to negotiate with him through the intercom, but he thinks we\u2019re going to have no option but to open fire on Aaron.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell did he get an army truck? Is William with him?\u201d\n\u201cApparently the town has been in a state of martial law since yesterday and the National Guard have taken over according to Aaron\u2019s ranting. I guess he stole one. I don\u2019t think William is with him. Anyway Bobby wants you to be safe so follow me to where all the children...\u201d\n\nLoud shouting by Bobby in the distance suddenly interrupts Helen. You immediately rush towards where he might be located despite the protests by the Helen that you need to come with her though she just runs along with you.\n\nYou soon manage to catch up with the most of the family (Save for the younger children and Diana) who are standing in the foyer with their weapons ready and Bobby who has opened the front door.\n\n\u201cAaron, I tried being reasonable. YOU left here without permission, but that was fine because it\u2019s obvious you didn\u2019t feel happy here. There are several paths to Tiamat\u2019s glory and you obviously had your own ideas about which one you should pick. Anyone here is free to leave, but NOBODY is going to be forced to leave due to your threats! Again, if you try coming in here, you\u2019re going to be shot down like a fucking dog and I\u2019ll personally perform Tiamat\u2019s ritual of desecration over your stinking body so your soul NEVER enters Timat\u2019s glory!\u201d Bobby shouts and walks out with his rifle drawn. Bobby\u2019s brother Jordan is the first one who cautiously follows afterwards and then everyone else slowly walks towards the door as well. You don\u2019t think anyone has even paid any attention to you or Helen (who keeps pulling on you to leave).\n\n\u201cMy soul is already with Tiamat! You can\u2019t do shit about it ritual boy! If you unworthy fucks won\u2019t embrace chaos as Tiamat intended, then I\u2019m gonna bring it to you!\u201d Aaron shouts through a bullhorn, which is followed by a laugh.\n\nThe truck revs up and Bobby orders everyone to open fire. You and Helen are still inside at this point so you don\u2019t actually do so and just hang back as you watch Aaron mow through the gate followed by a hail of bullets peppering the oncoming truck.\n\nThe truck swerves hard to the left smashes into Brandon\u2019s parked vehicle. You can hear him swearing about it. Meanwhile you also see Jordan jumping up and down in victory and running over to the wrecked truck.\n\n\u201cYeah! We got that bastard! Whoo!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cHey Jordan, get the fuck back here, don\u2019t go off ahead like that by yourself!\u201d Bobby shouts.\n\u201cAw, it\u2019s fine, he didn\u2019t survive that!\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when Aaron proves Jordan wrong, starting by recovering from his crash and shooting several holes into Jordan. Then he follows up by throwing several grenades out the truck window.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d Bobby shouts and everyone runs back, but not before several explosions occur. Nobody is killed, but everyone scrambles and on the ground crawling for cover. Bobby himself crawls behind cover of another parked vehicle and continues to fire in the direction of the truck.\n\nHelen now really tugs at you saying you need to come with her where its safe, but you wonder if you should try to help Bobby considering he\u2019s the only one currently trying to kill Aaron. Everyone else has completely retreated and is even running past you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Bobby", "result": "This is the man you\u2019ve chosen to marry for better or worse.

He sees you out the corner of his eye while still keeping an eye on the direction of the truck.\n\n\u201cKeep your head down, I think Aaron escaped out the passenger door of the truck and is hiding behind Brandon\u2019s car now. Where the hell did you come from anyway? I told Helen to go get you and the younger children to a safer location when Aaron showed up.\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m showing you that I\u2019m not just going to let you do this shit alone. I\u2019m with you all the way. No hiding with Helen and the kids, no matter what you say.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re interrupted by gunfire on your position and Aaron ranting.\n\n\u201cYou think you can stop what\u2019s coming by hiding? Hah! People are already fucking EATING each other out there! Shit, I\u2019ll be doing you a favor by killing you now. Actually now that I think about\u2026 your blonde bitch looks like a fine piece of ass in more way than one!\u201d Aaron shouts and starts laughing maniacally and then throws another grenade your way.\n\nYou and Bobby have no choice but to leave your position and make a dash back to the house entrance. It\u2019s somewhat of a minor miracle that you and Bobby aren\u2019t hit by any of the bullets he fires at you. You manage to get inside just as the grenade goes off and adds to the total of destroyed vehicles outside.\n\nYou and Bobby are on the floor though Bobby has partially managed to cover you with his own body.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did he do, rip off the entire National Guard armory?\u201d you say as Bobby back kicks the front door shut from his prone position.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo more explosions are heard on the left side of compound. Aaron is apparently throwing explosives through the windows now.\n\n\u201cShit, I hope nobody ran and hid over there.\u201d You remark as the pair of you start to get up off the floor.\n\u201cWhere the fuck IS everyone anyway? Nice to know I can REALLY count on these fuckers when the going gets tough. Why the fuck am I even bothering again? Fuck!\u201d Bobby yells in frustration.\n\nYou understand his anger, but it\u2019s probably not the best time for a rant.\n\n\u201cBobby, calm yourself. You can yell at those idiots later, but right now all that matters is that I\u2019m here helping you okay?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHey\u2026I\u2019ll help too\u2026\u201d a voice suddenly says. You both look and see that it\u2019s Helen with a pistol in hand.\n\u201cHelen, you\u2019re supposed to be with the children!\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cVeronica and Brandon are with them. When they ran, the children\u2019s room upstairs was the first place they went. Guess they were concerned about their daughters.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026well I guess I can understand the pair of them running to their children. So they\u2019re looking after all the kids then?\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cYeah, I figured since they were doing that, I\u2019d come help you, though I hope I just don\u2019t get in the way.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s good. Glad you\u2019re here Helen. What about Ronald and Denise?\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen them. Um, I haven\u2019t seen Diana either\u2026in case you were wondering.\u201d Helen remarks briefly glancing at you after saying it.\n\u201cHopefully Aaron kills her.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, well I actually was going to exile her today, but that might have to wait assuming Aaron doesn\u2019t kill her.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cOkay, enough of all this. What\u2019s the game plan?\u201d you ask slightly disappointed that Bobby\u2019s decision was to exile Diana rather than death, but you aren\u2019t entirely surprised. Still, there\u2019s always the hope that Aaron does kill her.\n\nBobby quickly snaps back to the situation at hand.\n\n\u201cWell it sounds like he\u2019s stopped with the explosives, or maybe he\u2019s just fishing out more. I\u2019d say the safest bet is to get to the second floor and shoot him through one of the windows. No point in going back out the front door when we can get the vantage point.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know he\u2019s still outside, he might\u2019ve already entered house through one of the holes he\u2019s undoubtedly made with his grenades.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah true. No telling where he might be heading first. The armory maybe?\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s still gotta come through this way if he wants to go there. Given his state of mind though he might also try to do something like run upstairs and kill all the children for fun. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to try to access the prisoner\u2019s dungeon and set them all free. It is on the left wing after all.\u201d\nMaybe we should split up and take different floors?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cMaybe though I\u2019m not keen on the idea of splitting up. (Sigh) Okay. Since you said Brandon and Veronica are with the children, I\u2019m going to hope they\u2019re up to dealing with Aaron if he shows up. I\u2019m going to the left wing of the house and try to stop him there. I want you two to stay here and guard the foyer in case he somehow manages to sneak past me and is heading towards the armory. He\u2019s going to have come through here.\u201d Bobby says.\n\nHelen immediately complies with the plan, but you\u2019re not so sure.\n\n\u201cI really think I should come with you. Splitting up is always a bad idea in these situations.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it either, but it\u2019s a big house and we need to cast a wide net to deal with this asshole.\u201d Bobby says and then puts his arm over you and takes you aside.\n\n\u201cBesides, as glad as I am that Helen stepped up, we both know she\u2019s not exactly a fighter. I don\u2019t want her coming with me and possibly getting in my way when I\u2019m hunting Aaron, but by the same token I\u2019d feel more comfortable if you were here with her since I know you can handle yourself and aren\u2019t going to freeze up in a fight. I\u2019ll be fine by myself. Don\u2019t worry about me. I mean I did kill your uncle Ed by myself right?\u201d Bobby whispers.\n\nYou glance over at Helen and as brave as she\u2019s trying to appear, she still looks like a deer in the headlights. Bobby\u2019s right in that her survival would probably increase if you were here and she had the misfortune of Aaron popping up.\n\nThen again by the same token, YOU\u2019D actually feel safer being with Bobby. You\u2019d also worry less about Bobby\u2019s own safety if you were watching his back. After all, this situation is also little different than the one with your uncle. Aaron\u2019s not just carrying a knife; he\u2019s carrying around grenades and machine guns for one thing. Also, while Helen might be a nice girl, she\u2019s ultimately not your responsibility.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Bobby", "result": "\u201cBobby, I\u2019m coming with you and I\u2019m not budging on this.

Instead he smiles and then kisses you on the lips quickly.\n\n\u201cOkay then, you\u2019re with me. Helen! You\u2019re going to be guarding this area alone.

The smell of gunpowder and smoke is in the air of part of the house and peering in one of the rooms you see the results of Aaron\u2019s grenades.\n\nThe room is charred, blackened and wrecked. Whatever items were in this room have been completely destroyed and there is now a large hole allowing direct entry from the outside to the inside.\n\n\u201cSo much for the second den. Glad none of my personal stuff was in here. (Sigh) One more thing to fix.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cHe either wounded himself during or you must\u2019ve hit him from before, look.\u201d You say and point at small splotches of blood in the room and creating a trail going to one of the other doors. (Or rather the entryway since the door itself is in pieces and not even on the hinges anymore.)\n\u201cYep, he\u2019s going towards the dungeon. Knew he\u2019d be somewhat predictable.\u201d Bobby says and the pair of you follows the blood trail.\n\nYou pass through a series of room to get to your destination. Some furnished, some empty. The left wing of this house seems to be designed a little oddly though, almost mazelike. Eventually you get to a small room that has a door leading to what you assume is the dungeon Bobby mentioned.\n\n\u201cWell he\u2019s probably down there. The blood trail is heading down and we would\u2019ve seen him if he\u2019d doubled back. You ready?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cNo seriously. Are you ready? Because while I know you\u2019ve got your mindset on killing Aaron, you MIGHT very well have to kill whatever prisoners he\u2019s managed to convince to help him. You might be less inclined to kill them due to them\u2026well having a legitimate reason for wanting to escape.\u201d\n\u201cBobby, I already told you, I\u2019m with you on this one hundred percent. If that means shooting a few prisoners well Tiamat\u2019s going to be getting a few extra souls to eat early or something.\u201d You say causing Bobby to chuckle a bit.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not exactly how it works, but as always I\u2019m touched by your enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be touched all over by my enthusiasm after this is over.\u201d You say and then give him a deep tongue kiss along with a firm caress to his crotch.\n\u201cWhoa, easy there girl. We\u2019ll get to that. Let\u2019s take care of this first.\u201d Bobby says reluctantly pulling back from you.\n\nTo be honest, you\u2019re not even sure what came over you. Maybe you\u2019re starting to not only accept this type of life, but enjoying it as well which might concern you more if you weren\u2019t in the middle of hunting someone down and shooting them.\n\nBobby descends first and then you. While descending you start to catch the sent of what a dungeon full of unwashed prisoners locked in it smells like. It isn\u2019t the most pleasant, but actually better than you expected from a dungeon.\n\nWhen you get downstairs the dungeon is relatively well lit. You see rows of empty cages to the left and right side and on the very far end you see Aaron who has a group of what you presume to be the prisoners. He\u2019s apparently bullied them into acting as a human barrier.\n\nThey\u2019re a mixture of old, young, male and female and they\u2019re a dirty, miserable and practically naked lot. Most of them are barely standing up. Looks like taking care of them wasn\u2019t high on Bobby\u2019s list though then again why would it?\n\nAt this point if you have to shoot them (which seems likely) you think you\u2019d be doing them a favor.\n\nAaron himself doesn\u2019t look all that great from what you can see of him. He\u2019s obviously been wounded and this is his last ditch effort to\u2026well whatever his grand plan was. He\u2019s holding something in his hand though above his head, probably another grenade.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ve won? Hah! I\u2019ve already beaten you! You kill me and this grenade drops, then what will you do for sacrifices? You\u2019ll have to go out and get more and I guarantee NONE of you are prepared for the beautiful chaos that lies outside. None of you are truly worthy of Tia\u2026\u201d Aaron rambles insanely.\n\nAaron is completely delusional at this point. Bobby doesn\u2019t even argue with him, the whole time Aaron is talking, Bobby is taking careful aim at his head. A single shot drops Aaron and then Bobby tells you to run which you both do up the stairs.\n\nYou get to the top just in time for the grenade to explode. No harm done to you, but you can imagine the mess that\u2019s down in the dungeon now.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Guess you\u2019ll have to repair your dungeon too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah\u2026fuck!\u201d Bobby yells and slams his fist into the floor.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t we win?\u201d\n\u201cThat sonofabitch killed all the prisoners! Now who the hell are we supposed to sacrifice for the wedding tomorrow?!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026do I have to sacrifice someone? I mean I\u2019m not asking because I don\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m just asking is it absolutely necessary for the wedding? I mean couldn\u2019t I make a sacrifice later when we get someone else? I mean I\u2019ll even come with you to make the capture.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) No\u2026I suppose in the scheme of things it isn\u2019t necessary. I just wanted everything to be perfect. I dunno\u2026Aaron might\u2019ve been right about one thing. Maybe I am a little caught up in ritual\u2026but still I THINK it\u2019s important to revere Tiamat in a formal way! Just because I\u2019m not completely running amok stealing army trucks and throwing explosives at shit doesn\u2019t make me any less dedicated to glorious chaos! I mean\u2026does it?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s your cue to support the fragile male ego again.\n\n\u201cWell of course it doesn\u2019t my love. Your way is obviously a more intelligent approach to chaos. Just because something is chaotic, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless. You\u2019re playing the long game and attempting to build a dynasty. Instead of burning out quick, you\u2019re plotting and planning labyrinthian schemes to eventually burn them all.\u201d You say while looking into Bobby\u2019s eyes and stroking the side of his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you understand me.\u201d Bobby remarks and hugs you tightly.\n\nBobby really does always feel completely better with just a few supportive words from you. Its sort of amazing really since you didn\u2019t realize you had this sort of power over him, then again you two were never really in a situation like this before except the first time you met and that was when you counted on him to \u201crescue you.\u201d That dynamic has clearly changed. You guess this is what his grandmother meant when she spoke to you in the dream.\n\nIn any case Bobby tells you he\u2019s going to check the dungeon to see if maybe there were any survivors just in case. You offer to help, but he says there\u2019s no point in both of you trudging through blood and gore, which is probably covering the place. You tell him you\u2019ll just wait for him and kiss him before he heads back downstairs.\n\nNo sooner has Bobby left, when you hear footsteps coming from the room nearby. Still paranoid, you hold up your pistol not knowing who is coming through\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHold on! It\u2019s just me! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d you hear a female voice say.\n\u201cHelen?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me! Is everything okay here? Heard another loud explosion in this direction.\u201d Helen says and enters the room cautiously.\n\u201cYeah everything\u2019s fine. Aaron\u2019s dead. How come you\u2019re not guarding the foyer?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was, but then Diana showed up and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019ve seen Diana?\u201d you interrupt and Helen\u2019s head drops a little looking sad.\n\u201cYeah\u2026she was um\u2026I dunno. She showed up in the foyer and wasn\u2019t acting\u2026I mean she\u2019d always had a mean streak in her, but I just couldn\u2019t take it\u2026\u201d\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what happened, but obviously something occurred between Helen and her sister.\n\n\u201cHelen, out with it. Where is she and what happened?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s tied up in the large living room and unconscious. I had to knock her out.\u201d\n\u201cWait you knocked out Diana?\u201d\n\u201cI had to. She was talking crazy like Aaron. She wanted to kill you.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s hardly surprising.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell she also wanted to kill Bobby and she wanted me to help in all this! I\u2026I just couldn\u2019t do that! I mean I don\u2019t have any hatred for you (sniffle) and I love Bobby! You know? He\u2019s the leader of this family and should be respected! I protested and tried to reason with her\u2026but she just kept pushing and pushing like when we were kids and all my life! I couldn\u2019t let her go through with it. (sniffle) Then she started threatening that she\u2019d do something to the children\u2026and I just lost it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Helen. You did what you had to.\u201d You say trying to keep Helen from getting too weepy.\n\nIt\u2019s still hard to believe that Helen stood up to\u2026 well anyone, let alone her sister. Maybe your recent actions provided a bit of a model for her to follow of standing up for one\u2019s self, maybe there was just only so much bullying she could take and that last threat was the final straw. Maybe it was a combination.\n\nEither way, this event has given you an idea.\n\n\u201cSo, she\u2019s still alive?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, I mean even after all the horrible things she was saying, I still couldn\u2019t kill her\u2026she\u2019s still my sister.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable, but she still has to pay for this treachery as all who betray Tiamat do.\u201d\n\nYou call downstairs for Bobby.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bobby answers.\n\u201cAnyone alive down there?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, just charred bloody body parts everywhere. Looks like we\u2019ll have to do the wedding without the sacrifice.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think we\u2019ll be okay. Come on up.\u201d You state with a big smile.\n\nWhen Bobby comes back up you explain what recently occurred with Helen and suggest that Diana be the person you sacrifice. Bobby is silent for half a second and then agrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m ecstatic about this, but it is what it is. You are my soon to be wife and Diana has proven to be a traitor. Death by your hand is certainly a fitting punishment. Do you have an opinion on this Helen?\u201d\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cI\u2026my opinion on the matter is unimportant\u2026. It\u2019s just\u2026very sad that Diana couldn\u2019t have been\u2026 nicer. I support you Bobby and you too Suzy.\u201d Helen says obviously upset.\n\nWith that settled, Bobby, you and Helen all make your way back to where Helen said she tied up Diana. When you arrive, you see Diana unconscious on the floor with her arms and legs hogtied tightly with a bunch of duct tape and also her mouth covered with it.\n\nYou also see Denise and Ronald nearly setting her free! Bobby scolds them of course and brings them up to date on the situation. Helen excuses herself and says she wants to check on the children and tell them everything has calmed down now.\n\n\u201cYeah and tell Veronica and Brandon they can come down too. Them and YOU two, I need to have a long talk with. \u201d Bobby says pointing at Denise and Ronald who are somewhat a little worried about Bobby\u2019s comment.\n\u201cWhat about her? Where are you going to keep her?\u201d you ask pointing to Diana.\n\u201cWell there are still a couple of intact cages down in the dungeon. I\u2019ll probably throw her unconscious ass in one of them and she won\u2019t be coming up until the big day tomorrow. Shit, there\u2019s so much to do, cleaning up, getting prepared, (Sigh) well we better get started.\u201d\n\nBobby tells you not to worry about doing anything as you did enough today just standing by him and he wants you to just rest up for tomorrow. You offer to help, but he really won\u2019t hear of it. You don\u2019t press the issue since hey if he doesn\u2019t want you doing any work, you\u2019re not going to argue about that. Before you leave he tells you that he\u2019s got a spare gun in his clothing drawer just in case of an emergency.\n\nYou grab a quick meal from the kitchen before heading back to the bedroom where you stay for the rest of the day and night. You hear noise occasionally from downstairs. At one point you hear the sound of vehicles outside and looking out the window you see someone driving the damaged army truck in front of where Aaron crashed through the gate as a temporary barrier you guess.\n\nYou stay up for Bobby as long as you can, but eventually you realize he\u2019s really focused on trying to fix and clean up the house as much as he can and probably won\u2019t be back anytime soon. Too bad, since you weren\u2019t kidding about displaying your enthusiasm to him after the Wild West shootout was over.\n\nTaking matters into your own hands with your battery powered substitute, you satisfy yourself before going to sleep, hoping that tonight\u2019s dream doesn\u2019t have you deep throating the Washington Monument or something.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\"And now Suzy, having beaten the chicken soup out of all her other opponents this week, will take this final challenge by herself! Will she be able to do it ladies and gentlemen? Will she be able to impress Misty at last? We\u2019ll find out today! Let\u2019s give our small town girl some encouragement for her task at hand!\u201d\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at\u2026\n\nA big bag of dicks.\n\nIt\u2019s even labeled as such. BIG BAG OF DICKS in big black lettering so you can\u2019t miss it.\n\nYou don\u2019t even look inside the bag; you take their word for it and double face palm before exhaling and looking back up.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d you ask in disbelief.\n\u201cThis is the last task Suzy\u2026\u201d the disembodied announcer\u2019s voice whispers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit, I\u2019m not eating a goddamn bag of dicks! That\u2019s just fucking disgusting for one thing and for another\u2026\n\nSuddenly Bobby\u2019s grandmother appears as she has been doing in your dreams.\n\n\u201cSee? Told you she wasn\u2019t going to do it. Still, it was funny to see the reaction.\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother cackles and with a wave of her cane, you\u2019re back in that blasted wasteland you were in last time.\n\n\u201cSo what now? Am I going to meet this Misty, whoever the fuck that is?\u201d\n\u201cNot quite yet. You\u2019re still not married to my grandson. Misty has decided that she\u2019ll meet you after that event\u2026and sheesh you still haven\u2019t figured out who Misty is yet? You suffer a head injury when Aaron was tossing grenades around?\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother asks and then taps you in the forehead with her hand.\n\u201cOw! Stop!\u201d you say and back away.\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t this slow on the uptake today. Oh well, guess you can\u2019t help being blonde. Anyway, congrats on your wedding and you\u2019ve got my blessing. Good luck!\u201d\n\nGood luck? Somehow that doesn\u2019t sound reassuring. You\u2019re about to ask Bobby\u2019s grandmother what she exactly means by that, but then she waves that damn cane again and you\u2019re enveloped the blackness and then you wake up.\n\n\u201cGah, fucking bitch.\u201d You say groggily.\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry for waking you\u2026but we really need to see if this fits.\u201d a familiar female voice remarks.\n\nYou look around the room and see Helen coming in carrying some red clothing.\n\n\u201cHuh? No, not you\u2026wait what are you doing in here anyway? Did Bobby spend all night working on the house?\u201d you ask\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing in your wedding dress and yes, Bobby has been working on the house for the most part. Trying to patch up the big hole in the house, cleaning up the dungeon, blocking the front gate. He had to bury our brother Jordan as well. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s actually slept yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, forgot that that asshole killed one of your siblings. I didn\u2019t know him that well, but sorry for your loss.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cThank you. Yes, it was very sad, but to be honest Jordan wasn\u2019t the brightest. I remember numerous times when looking after him I had to stop him from eating something poisonous or doing something else life threatening so it\u2019s actually amazing he lived as long as he did. Still, he had some very endearing qualities. He looked up to Bobby a lot, wanted to be just like him. He even had a small crush on me I think to partially emulate Bobby and Diana\u2019s old relationship.\u201d Helen says with a smile before her face goes back to normal.\n\n\u201cBut we are all just puppets in Tiamat\u2019s glorious chaos, so we all need to just move on right? Could you see if this fits?\u201d Helen cheerfully asks holding up the red clothing which now looks a lot like lingerie.\n\u201cWait, that\u2019s the wedding dress? It looks like slutty underwear from Hot Secret.\u201d You answer and get out of bed.\n\nHelen\u2019s face looks a bit offended by that statement.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother wore this on her wedding day! She had this dress made of the finest silk, not whatever cheap material they use in North Tiwanaland or some place! THIS is a one of a kind article of clothing! It\u2019s not something you\u2019d find in some edgy teenager hang out!\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cOkay! Geez. I\u2019m not trying to insult the dress or your grandmother. It\u2019s just\u2026well I thought I\u2019d be wearing something a little more\u2026 substantial. But seeing as your family isn\u2019t exactly conventional and when in Rome\u2026I guess I better try it on. Um, you washed it right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Hand washed it myself. Can\u2019t risk putting it in a machine.\u201d Helen says and hands it to you.\n\nYou have to admit; it does feel rather nice in your hands.\n\n\u201cOh, here\u2019s the stockings and the shoes too.\u201d Helen says and hands you what is apparently the rest of the outfit.\n\n\u201cRed fishnets\u2026red high heels\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes. Those shoes were also special made with the finest\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLeather. Yes, I can imagine. Let me guess the fishnets were made with the finest silk as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course, what else would it be?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else indeed. Okay, well I guess I\u2019m going in the bathroom to change.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to you know. I mean I won\u2019t be offended if you change in front of me. We\u2019re practically family now.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cUm\u2026no that\u2019s okay. Besides, I should wash up before changing anyway. I probably still smell of sweat from yesterday\u2019s events.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well I guess I\u2019ll just wait out here then and remember you can call if you need something.\n\nYou enter the bathroom and go through your usual routine of showering and such. Afterwards you finally get around putting on the \u201cwedding dress\u201d\n\nThe first thing you do is look at the dress before putting it on and wondering if it\u2019s going to be bigger in the chest area. While you\u2019re not lacking in that region, you\u2019ve met Bobby\u2019s grandmother (in dream form anyway) and she\u2019s got at least another couple cup sizes on you. In fact her body type back in her prime was more of an old school 1950s pinup girl hourglass figure than your own \u201cpetite\u201d size.\n\nThe funny thing is, as soon as you put it on, it seems to fit perfectly to your own body. The material isn\u2019t any sort of spandex or stretchy material, it\u2019s silk like Helen said, but given Bobby\u2019s family\u2019s strangeness, you have to wonder if it\u2019s\u2026magical?\n\n\u201cMagical underwear.\u201d You scoff; shaking your head in half disbelief you\u2019re even considering it. Not surprisingly the stockings AND the shoes fit you perfectly as well.\n\nYeah, Grandma Morningstar probably had all this stuff weaved by a giant magical spider voodoo priest or some shit because it doesn\u2019t make sense that any of this stuff would fit you so well.\n\nRegardless of its origins, you do feel pretty comfortable despite looking like a Hollywood streetwalker. The heels don\u2019t even hurt your feet, though you\u2019re still a little unsteady on them due to not being used to wearing such things. Let alone these being stilettos.\n\nThe last time you wore heels was when Uncle Ed made you wear stripperiffic clothing with the intent to lure Bobby and his dad into the woods where he could kill them. While everything turned out for the best because you met Bobby that fateful night, the part with Uncle Ed still gives you the shivers just thinking about it.\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror one more time, before leaving the bathroom.\n\n\u201cWell Suzy, you might look like a whore in this thing, but at least you look like a high priced one.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nWhen you exit the bathroom Helen stands up and looks at you.\n\n\u201cOh my. You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re\u2026so beautiful looking. I knew it would fit you perfectly.\u201d Helen gushes.\n\u201cYeah I am pretty hot looking in this get up. Shit, still can\u2019t balance on these heels though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh we have to go show everyone now what you look like. Maybe take some pictures!\u201d Helen says approaching you.\n\u201cWhat? I thought I was just putting it on as a test drive as it were. While I won\u2019t deny this stuff feels pretty comfortable on my skin that I don\u2019t mind wearing it, I sort of don\u2019t want to be walking around the house with it on until show time. Besides everyone can see how awesomely sexy I am then.\u201d\n\u201cI think they should see you now. It\u2019ll raise the spirits around here seeing you dressed like this.\u201d Helen remarks as she begins touching your arm.\n\u201cWell it\u2019ll raise something with the males around here when they see me of course. Not sure about the ladies of this house, though you\u2019re getting a little too close there Helen.\u201d\n\u201cOh please? At least go show Bobby. I know he\u2019d like to see you.\u201d Helen says ignoring your previous remark about invading your personal space.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s really busy right now, besides isn\u2019t it bad luck for me to see him right before the wedding?\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re thinking of those silly traditions for other weddings. That\u2019s not the case here. Come on I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d Helen says and at this point is pulling on your hands almost causing you fall.\n\u201cHey! I nearly fell! I told you already that you\u2019re too damn close!\u201d\n\nHelen immediately backs away and looks down submissively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Suzy. I didn\u2019t mean to violate your personal space. It\u2019s just I thought\u2026well it\u2019s Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about him?\n\u201cWell, as I said he hasn\u2019t slept and he\u2019s been working everyone like a task master trying to get the house as much in order as he can. And that\u2019s his right of course. He is the head of this family. Still, during all the hustle and bustle when I was going to see him when he was cleaning up the dungeon. I caught him weeping and praying to Tiamat. Normally I wouldn\u2019t have intruded, but he looked so\u2026vulnerable and sad. He kept going on about he wasn\u2019t even sure if this wedding was the right thing because he wasn\u2019t confident that he\u2019d be a strong enough husband for you and be a good provider. He was having doubts about even leading this family after all the mess that\u2019s happened this week.\u201d\n\u201cOh geez. I\u2019ve already told him several times that I loved him and that I was behind him no matter what.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell maybe that\u2019s all he needs again. Sometimes a little boost is all that someone needs to feel better. Like I remember yesterday when I was with the children during Aaron\u2019s rampage, I told them that they would be safe because Tiamat\u2019s chaos was in their favor that day.

I suppose I might as well get used to walking around in this thing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh I know he\u2019ll be so glad to see you, here let me get the door.\u201d Helen says and opens it for you.\n\nYou walk down the corridor with Helen nearby going on about how she\u2019s so glad you\u2019re officially going to be part of the family.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, when you start having all those babies, I can certainly help you out on that front.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be looking forward to it\u2026\u201d you say unenthusiastically while at the same time still trying to maintain your balance on the heels.\n\nWhen you get to the stairs you stop.\n\n\u201cShit, I think I should take these heels off before heading downstairs.

In fact I can even put my arm around you just to make sure you don\u2019t.\u201d Helen says and goes to balance you a bit.\n\u201cWell thanks, but I really don\u2019t need your arm around m\u2026\u201d you start to say and then Helen punches you in the face.\n\nThe punch itself isn\u2019t even that hard as far as punches go, in fact Helen even winces when she does it as if she wasn\u2019t confident in her abilities and was reluctant to even do so.\n\nHowever combined with being on top of the stairs and your high heels you lose your balance completely and go tumbling down them.\n\nFalling down a flight of stairs is always a bit of a crapshoot, sometimes people survive it with just a few bumps and bruises and other times they break their necks and die before they reach the bottom.\n\nYou fall somewhere in between, you break your neck, but you don\u2019t die. You won\u2019t be moving anytime soon though. You\u2019d probably be in more horror about the situation of not being able to move if your head wasn\u2019t so scrambled from the fall.\n\nAs you struggle to remain conscious, you see Helen coming down the stair before you. Her face has a sad expression.\n\n\u201cOh no. I was afraid this might happen.\u201d She says with the tone of being genuinely upset.\n\nAs Helen approaches and kneels near your head you both hear the sounds of gunfire outside and shouting inside the house. Neither of you know what that\u2019s about, but you\u2019re in no condition to worry about it.\n\nHelen picks your head up and speaks.\n\n\u201cSorry Suzy, but I just love Bobby too much to let you have him. I wish there could\u2019ve been another way, but I\u2019ll make this quick.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t respond, you just close your eyes and let go.\n\nAnd then a final snap.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Talk with Helen a little more", "result": "That last statement doesn\u2019t sound right to you\u2026\n\n\u201cWait a minute Helen. I thought you said yesterday that Veronica and Brandon ran to you and stayed with the kids when you parted company with them.\u201d\n\nHelen pauses for a moment.\n\n\u201cUh yeah, I did. Yes! I meant I left the kids alone, but just as I was leaving, it was fortunate that Veronica and Brandon showed up at that time so they weren\u2019t completely alone.\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s grandmother claimed you were slow on the uptake and maybe in dreamland you are, but you know damn well when someone is obviously lying to you.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen Helen.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWha\u2026yes it did!\u201d Helen exclaims.\n\u201cOkay then\u2026\u201d you say and sit down to take off your heels.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking off these fucking heels because I don\u2019t feel like nearly breaking my neck when we go ask Veronica and Brandon to confirm your story.\u201d\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think that will be necessary. In fact, I think Bobby will be fine. Probably just wedding jitters. Apologies for bothering you and glad to see that the dress fits you.\u201d Helen says and starts backing towards the door.\n\u201cYou know now that I\u2019m thinking about it, it seems pretty strange that Bobby would be crying and praying in front of Diana who I presume is sitting in a dungeon cage right now.\u201d\n\u201cShe was unconscious?\u201d Helen says as if saying it in the tone of a question is going to cause it to be more believable.\n\u201cUnconscious or not, I doubt Bobby would show any sort of weakness around Diana now. In fact I\u2019m starting to doubt a lot of things\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Helen\u2019s eyes widen in fear and she turns to run for the door. Just as she gets to the handle, you manage to bean her in the head with one of the heels. It\u2019s just enough to stop her from getting away before you rush over and grab her by the hair and throw her to the floor.\n\n\u201cOut with it bitch.\u201d You say and lock the door.\n\nWhen she doesn\u2019t answer right away, you raise your hand and Helen starts to cry before you\u2019ve even done anything. She cowers by curling up and putting her hands and arms in front of her completely submissively.\n\n\u201cPlease! Mercy! It wasn\u2019t my idea! It was all Diana! You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like having such a bullying older sister who dominates virtually every aspect of your life!\u201d\n\u201cSave the pity party speech about being a victim of sibling abuse. Heard it before and I already lived something similar so it doesn\u2019t impress me. Besides, I\u2019m not buying this babe in the woods routine anymore Helen. At best you\u2019re lying to cover up the fact that Diana AND yourself were planning on killing me all along yesterday and you just covered your own ass when it looked like things weren\u2019t going to work out. At worst, this entire thing was your idea and Diana was just your dumb ass pawn. Either way, I\u2019m not enthused and it doesn\u2019t change the fact that YOU were trying to kill me\u2026were you going to make another attempt today? Huh? Is that why you came up here? Maybe push me down the stairs or something? Claim it was an accident? ANSWER ME AND DON\u2019T FUCKING LIE!\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Okay! I\u2019ll tell you everything! Just please try to understand it wasn\u2019t personal! I actually like you!\u201d\n\u201cNot personal?! You like me? So I guess your plan to kill me was just your way of showing affection?\u201d\n\u201cNo (sob) I did it because I just love (sob) Bobby so much! I always have and I stood on the sidelines too long. (sob) I was just so desperate\u2026\u201d\n\nYou just shake your head and sigh at this point. Helen sits up from the floor and scoots back to prop herself up against your bed coughing, sniffling, and trying to regain her composure. You stand nearby ready to jump on her if she tries anything, but for now you allow this moment for her to \u201cexplain\u201d as it were.\n\n\u201cIf there had been some way to remove you Suzy without killing you I would have done it. You have to believe me I really would have. I even thought about approaching you in a plan to kill Diana instead.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and then you would\u2019ve probably killed me afterwards to make it look like Diana and I killed each other.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I was going to\u2026well I was going to try to seduce you.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you say completely surprised by that part of the explanation.\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t sure, but I just sort of got a feeling from you that you might be a bit\u2026 flexible on your orientation.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cWha\u2026 (sputter) What the hell would give you that impression?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI dunno\u2026sometimes I thought your eyes were wandering all over my body a little more than average whenever we spoke, plus you were so nice to me and you just sort of give off a lesbian vibe at times. I probably would\u2019ve been too shy to go through with it anyway so it obviously wouldn\u2019t have worked.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right that wouldn\u2019t have worked! And what was your plan after that if your main goal was Bobby? Were you going to seduce me and while you were fucking me from behind with a big strap on you were going to plunge a knife in my back?\u201d you ask Helen.\n\u201cNo, I told you, if I didn\u2019t have to kill you, I wouldn\u2019t have. I would have just suggested that we both marry Bobby. It\u2019s not common, but our religion does allow for multiple wives. I think\u2026 I think I could have shared him with you.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2026I can\u2019t believe how fucked up this situation even is\u2026\u201d you say sitting down on a nearby chair. Meanwhile Helen continues her tale of woe.\n\n\u201cBut I approached Diana because she was my sister and I knew her better. She was predictable. After I saw you beat her and after Bobby laid down the law to her about how it was over, she was a broken woman. Seriously, I\u2019d never seen her confidence so shaken. After being on the receiving end of her abuse for so long, it was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up. So I convinced her of the plan\u2026actually took me longer than I thought it would. I thought she\u2019d be hungry for revenge, but no. I had to reignite that fire, but I knew she\u2019d agree in the end.\u201d\n\u201cSo she WAS trying to kill me too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yes. That was the plan as far as she knew. She\u2019d kill you, but then I\u2019d kill her and make up an excuse that I tried to save you or something similar. Of course when you stayed with Bobby during that whole time we were dealing with Aaron, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work which then resulted in an argument between me and Diana since she was now back to bullying mode. I knocked her out and I nearly killed her then, but I thought suggesting that she be your sacrifice on your wedding day would be fitting. When I found out Aaron had killed all the other prisoners\u2026well that worked out even better since you suggested it.\u201d\n\u201cBut you still wanted to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026after the chaos of yesterday and after I saw how you stuck by Bobby. I knew you really did love Bobby as much as Diana did\u2026maybe even as much as me. So I temporary rethought my actions. I thought maybe I could live with Bobby being with someone like you. I mean you were nice to me at least. And I knew at least Bobby would be happy with you. When I woke up this morning though, I realized I just couldn\u2019t let you have him without at least making one last ditch effort\u2026and so here we are.\u201d\n\nAt this point Helen starts to lose what little composure she mustered up to tell her side of the story. She starts to break down in tears again and apologizes to you and going on about how much she loves Bobby. It\u2019s really pitiful and sad. You can\u2019t believe you\u2019re almost considering NOT killing her now.\n\nBefore you can come to any sort of conclusion, you hear shooting and screaming from outside. Still keeping an eye on Helen, you edge over to the window and take a peek.\n\nYou see several figures crawling under the truck blocking the broken front gate or trying to climb the fence. The ones that have gotten in are loping in a wild jerky like motion. They\u2019re also screaming, howling and making inhuman sounds. From your vantage point they LOOK human, but they\u2019re certainly not acting like it.\n\nA loud banging on the door occurs next and you glare at Helen who doesn\u2019t make a sound.\n\n\u201cHey! Suzy! You in there?! Why\u2019s this door locked?\u201d you hear a voice shout. You think its Veronica.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m in here. What\u2019s going on? I just heard all the commotion.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being attacked by zombies!\u201d Veronica answers.\n\nYou and Helen look over at each other briefly.\n\n\u201cDid you say zombies?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, I mean\u2026I dunno if they are. Maybe they\u2019re just rabid humans or something, but they\u2019re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Veronica. I\u2019ll be out in a moment!\u201d you yell.\n\u201cWell hurry up\u2026and you haven\u2019t seen Helen have you?\u201d\n\nHelen and you look at each other again.\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s in here with me. I was trying on my wedding dress that she brought.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIf the pair of you don\u2019t stop playing dress up, there won\u2019t be a damn wedding! Bobby\u2019s having a hard enough time trying to keep them from getting close to the house!\u201d\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n\u201cShit! That sounded close! I gotta go!\u201d Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell it looks like Bobby\u2019s \u201cpep talk\u201d yesterday lit a fire under his relative\u2019s asses to pull their weight around here at least.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day HAD to get worse\u2026\u201d you say shaking your head.\n\u201cSuzy, we need to go to Bobby, he needs our help.\u201d\n\u201cWe?\u201d you ask.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2026look\u2026I know what\u2019s just occurred between us and you have no reason to trust me, but from what Veronica said, it sound like this is a bad attack and we\u2019ll need everyone we can to stop it!\u201d\n\nShe might have a point or she might just be stalling for a chance to escape or clobber you in the head. Possibly both.", "action_results": [{"action": "Deal with Helen now", "result": "You can\u2019t trust her. Even if you wanted to, you can\u2019t do it. She\u2019s actually proven to be more dangerous than Diana could hope to be, if she\u2019s weaved multiple murder plots against you this week.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a choice. You have to kill her. In fact the more you look at how weak and helpless she is right now\u2026\n\nYou WANT to kill her.\n\n\u201cAlright, get up Helen, let\u2019s go help Bobby.\u201d You say offering a hand to help her up.\n\nHelen looks up at you and takes your hand trustingly. When she stands up, she starts to look relieved.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you back hand her and shove her to the floor.\n\nHelen holds the side of her face and tries to back away.\n\n\u201cNo! No! No! You can\u2019t! Please! No! Don\u2019t kill me!\u201d she utters.\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill you? I\u2019ll kill you twice you fucking cunt! And trust me, it\u2019s not going to look like an accident!\u201d you say and pounce on top of Helen.\n\nYou begin beating Helen like she stole something. Helen pathetically attempts to defend herself, but it predictably doesn\u2019t work. Her pleading for you to stop doesn\u2019t help either. Instead, your hands stop beating her face and then start to wrap around her neck. You want to stop that infernal wailing, the pleading, the crying, everything.\n\nShe tries to stop you from choking her, but your grip is firm. Her eyes begin to bulge a bit and she attempts to catch what is little left of her breath.\n\nThen you do something you don\u2019t even expect doing. You start to giggle. You\u2019ve gone beyond anger and are starting to enjoy this. Meanwhile Helen begins to gurgle and gasp what sounds to be words.\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s that? You trying to speak? You having a little trouble? Here, whisper it to me.\u201d You mock and get slightly closer while still maintaining your grip.\n\n\u201cBo\u2026Bob..by\u2026he\u2026help\u2026plea\u2026\u201d you hear Helen gasp.\n\u201cWhat? Bobby help you? He can\u2019t help you. He\u2019s not even here.\u201d You sneer.\n\nAs Helen\u2019s face turn an unnatural color, you just smile.\n\n\u201cShhh\u2026shhh\u2026just let go Helen\u2026just let go\u2026you fucking bitch\u2026\u201d\n\nThe light in her eyes starts to fade, the life begins to leave her body and her struggle is soon over. She ceases moving.\n\nIgnoring the gunfire and yelling you hear downstairs, you just continue to sit on top of her for a moment staring at her. You stroke her hair.\n\nYou\u2019ve finally crossed that line. You know you can kill someone if you have to. Actually you also know you can kill someone if you don\u2019t have to and while you went through a variety of emotions leading to it and during it, now that it\u2019s over, you don\u2019t feel much of anything.\n\nYou wonder if your Uncle Ed felt this when he killed someone. Maybe you take after him in some way? Could it be genetic and maybe you have some sort of latent serial killer tendency? Given your family, it isn\u2019t that hard to imagine insanity runs in it.\n\nIt sure would explain why you were so comfortable with Bobby in the first place. After all, what rational woman would stay with a man that runs a murderous cult?\n\nBut these are all things you can dwell on later; right now you need to help Bobby.\n\n\u201cYou know\u2026you did have pretty eyes.\u201d You say with a smirk and stand up.\n\nYou open the clothing drawer where Bobby keeps the spare gun he mentioned yesterday, take it and leave the room without even changing your clothes.\nAnd why should you? It\u2019s your wedding day after all.\n\nThe events that follow aren\u2019t nearly as interesting as the experience of your first kill. By the time you get to where Bobby and the rest of his family are holding back the invaders, they\u2019ve already killed most of them. You remember shooting a couple of the things, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as exciting as choking the life out of Helen.\n\nTurns out they weren\u2019t zombies anyway. Just seemingly mad humans trying to eat you. You can only guess your town is overrun by them and this is what Aaron was referring to when he said people were eating each other out there.\n\nSome sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He\u2019s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he\u2019s about to collapse.\n\nBobby asks you if you\u2019re okay and of course you say you\u2019re fine. He then tells the rest of his family to check the rest of the house just to make sure the situation is completely safe. After everyone leaves, he sits down in a nearby chair wiped out from this whole ordeal.\n\n\u201cI think you need to sleep.\u201d You say.\n\u201cCan\u2019t. Too much to do. Especially now. Bodies to clean up, walls to patch up, gates and doors to fix. Now we got these\u2026things attacking and who knows if any more will wander this way\u2026 there\u2019s just so much to do...\u201d Bobby says trying to fight the exhaustion.\n\u201cLet me take care of some of this. You don\u2019t have to do this all by yourself you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026shit\u2026the wedding. That\u2019s another thing we need to do\u2026I just\u2026had no fucking time to make the preparations\u2026I\u2019m sorry this couldn\u2019t be how it should\u2026\u201d Bobby adds.\n\u201cWill you not worry about that? Look, does this wedding really need to be so complicated? Can\u2019t we just get one of your family members to witness it and another to marry us right now so I can at last be your wife properly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even need to do that really\u2026I mean I\u2019m the high priest here. All I have to do is say the passage and you accept and we\u2019re married. No need for witnesses, I mean Tiamat\u2019s watching. Who else is needed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it? We could\u2019ve done that a long time ago!\u201d\n\u201cWell, like I\u2019ve told you before, I just wanted it to be perfect\u2026\u201d\n\nYou sit in Bobby\u2019s lap and wrap your arms around him.\n\n\u201cBobby, just being with you, is enough perfection for me. Besides, isn\u2019t the carnage surrounding us true perfection in the eyes of Tiamat\u2019s chaotic glory or something?\u201d you ask.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d He says.\n\nBobby recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you accept your place as his wife.\n\nThen the both of you kiss like you\u2019ve done so many times before, though this time it\u2019s different. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n\u201cOh. Here. I\u2019ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.\u201d Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It\u2019s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly.\n\n\u201cLet me guess, this used to be your grandmother\u2019s ring?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah\u2026how did you know?\u201d\n\u201cOh let\u2019s just say the fact that it fits me so well like her wedding dress did was a clue.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was meaning to ask about that.\u201d Bobby says rubbing your legs.\n\u201cOh Helen gave me the dress to try on before all the trouble went down. Didn\u2019t really have time to change.\u201d\n\u201c(Yawn) Where is Helen anyway? I didn\u2019t see her with you when you arrived, but then I was in the middle of blasting some freak\u2019s head off at the time.\u201d\n\u201cOh she stayed upstairs.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, probably looking after the children as usual. She\u2019s really reliable that way, (Yawn) nice girl. That\u2019s why didn\u2019t believe the bullshit Diana was spouting about her when I was cleaning up the dungeon.\u201d\n\u201cOh? What was that?\u201d\n\nBobby begins to close his eyes, but keeps talking.\n\n\u201cOh, she was trying to claim Helen set her up and the attempt on your life was all her plan and how she never wanted to kill me at all\u2026(yawn) typical desperation to save her own ass. Pretty laughable that she thought I\u2019d believe it, I mean Helen likes you.\u201d\n\u201cHm\u2026where is Diana now?\u201d\n\u201cOh she\u2019s still in her cage\u2026(yawn).\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to go kill her.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou, don\u2019t need to you know. You (yawn) don\u2019t need to prove anything. I can do it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m willing to do it. I mean maybe this isn\u2019t going to be official or how you planned, but I\u2019m part of this family now and I\u2019m going to make the effort to be fully part of it because I love you.\u201d\n\nAt this point Bobby smiles at your words and his consciousness fades completely and he\u2019s asleep. You give him another kiss and get up to head to the dungeon.\n\nWhen you get there you see Diana sitting in her cage with a bored expression. When she sees you, she ceases looking as bored.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d She says and her eyes begin to examine your clothing and then wander over to your finger sporting your new status in the family. She also spies the pistol in your hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2026heard a lot of noise upstairs. Is Bobby okay?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about Bobby. He\u2019s not your concern anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re the new top mama now?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t answer you just raise your arms presenting yourself to signify that is the case. Her head hangs briefly knowing she\u2019s truly defeated.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026 can you at least tell me if Helen\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s dead.\u201d You answer.\n\nThis revelation while not making any impact on Diana\u2019s ultimate fate still brings a brief bit of happiness to her.\n\n\u201cGood\u2026that\u2019s good\u2026 okay, no point in dragging this out.\u201d Diana says and stands as close as she can to the bars and you get slightly closer with the pistol drawn.\n\n\u201cFuck Tiamat and fuck you blondie.\u201d Diana says and then you fire a round into her chest.\n\nDiana falls back wheezing, gasping and clutching at the bloody wound. You move in closer to watch her for the last few minutes she clings to life, but then eventually she follows her sister in death.\n\nAnd now your \u201ccompetition\u201d has completely been eliminated.\n\nLeaving Diana in much the same way you left Helen, you go back upstairs and attempt to take charge of some of what needs to be done around the house.\n\nIt\u2019s actually easier than you think. Bobby\u2019s family is a little surprised by the fact that you and he got married so spur of the moment, but that\u2019s not a problem and given the recent events, they were less focused on attending a formal wedding anyway. You tell Veronica to go check on the children and to make sure they\u2019re okay, when she seems less than enthused to do it and asks where Helen is, you get in her face and tell her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Well shouldn\u2019t we tell Bobby?\u201d Veronica exclaims with the rest of the family looking a little surprised at this revalation.\n\u201cBobby needs his rest and I\u2019m calling the shots while he does so, now just do what the hell I say Veronica. The rest of you help me move these corpses out of here and Bobby\u2019s sleeping in the living room near the kitchen. Let\u2019s try not to wake him.\u201d\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that\u2019s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but then you worry that maybe that might attract more attention. You figure Bobby can make that decision tomorrow.\n\nSince you\u2019re not any sort of carpenter or anything similar your solution to patch up any broken windows and the front door is to barricade it with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. You take mercy on everyone and tell them to just sleep with a weapon tonight and you\u2019ll take tonight\u2019s watch. You aren\u2019t sure how you\u2019re going to do it with as tired as you are, but fortunately when you check on Bobby you find that he\u2019s just waking up and after a bit of a report, he is pleasantly surprised by what you\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s at least a few things I don\u2019t need to worry about. Probably a good idea on not burning the bodies yet. We can do that tomorrow when everyone is alert in case it does draw attention. Nice job in taking charge.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You say with a yawn.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go upstairs and get some sleep. I\u2019m good now. I can take watch.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure? You were up longer than I was.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m really fine. I don\u2019t usually need much sleep anyway. I just needed the brief recharge. Hey, we\u2019re in this together remember? I\u2019ll take over now.\u201d He says.\n\nYou don\u2019t argue you just kiss him goodnight and tell him you love him and to call you if he needs your help.\n\nYou head upstairs back to your bedroom feeling sleep creep up on you ever faster.\n\nWhen you get to your bedroom, you find Helen still lying on the floor where you left her. Besides forgetting to clean up her body, you also forgot to tell Bobby about what happened to her. (You didn\u2019t really tell the rest of his family either, you just said she was dead and they never really asked how she died.)\n\nYou look at Helen\u2019s corpse again and then look over at the portrait of Grandma Morningstar with its eyes watching everything as usual.\n\n\u201cFuck it, he can find out tomorrow. I\u2019m tired and I undoubtedly still have your ghostly mindfuck bullshit to look forward to in dreamland tonight.\u201d You say.\n\nStepping over Helen\u2019s body, you get into bed and fall asleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You\u2019ve won! You\u2019ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you\u2019ve also thrived! Ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s give our small town girl some applause and respect for she truly is worthy of it!\u201d\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at\u2026\n\nA bigger bag of dicks.\n\nIt\u2019s even labeled as such. BIGGER BAG OF DICKS in big black lettering so you can\u2019t miss it though that would be impossible since the bag itself is wide enough to take up half of the table and tall enough that you can\u2019t even see the audience from where you\u2019re sitting unless you stand up or look around the bag.\n\nYou just shake your head.\n\n\u201cThis joke never gets old with you does it?\u201d you ask.\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when everything disappears and you\u2019re facing Grandma Morningstar in the blasted wasteland again.\n\n\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t have anything to do with your oral fixation scenario dreams, but I will admit it\u2019s a pretty funny joke.\u201d\n\u201cHardly, but anyway am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou figure out who it is yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t catch it before. Misty\u2026MISS T\u2026Tiamat.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYay! Your pretty little blonde head finally got it! Give this woman the BIGGEST BIG OF DICKS as a reward!\u201d Grandma Morningstar cackles to the point where she actually starts wheezing a bit.\n\n\u201cYou done yet, you mean old crone?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cCrone is it? Better watch the tone there blondie, you might be officially family now, but don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to put up with your sass. Even in this form I could severely fuck you up, you best remember that.\u201d Grandma Morningstar warns.\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you exactly anyway? A ghost? A demon?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter? Tiamat blessed me with this existence for my dedication to chaos and if you continue to prove yourself worthy like you have been doing then when that inevitable day comes that you shuffle off your mortal coil you might be just as blessed as I am. I doubt it though. You\u2019ll probably just rot in the ground.\u201d\n\u201cProbably right since I\u2019m not exactly the most religious person.\u201d\n\u201cBah, Tiamat doesn\u2019t really care about mindless ritualistic worship. She is the goddess of chaos so who knows what she really likes at any given time?\u201d\n\u201cInteresting, so am I meeting her now?\u201d\n\u201cUh, no. Tiamat is sort of busy now or maybe she just doesn\u2019t care, hard to tell sometimes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! I thought you said I was meeting her now.\u201d\n\u201cI actually never did, but cheer up. Given that you just admitted to not being a religious sort you can\u2019t be too disappointed in not meeting her directly.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026no, but that\u2019s not the point. I sort of feel like there was a build up and by not meeting her now is an anti-climax.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but if you really think about it, your journey has only just begun! Perhaps there is more build up for the ultimate climax later! There is nothing to say you won\u2019t meet her in the future, but will it be on good terms or bad? Eh? Eh? One never knows!\u201d\n\u201cGreat, more shit to worry about.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar steps forward and touches you on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t despair blondie, you\u2019ll do fine. Besides, I like you.\u201d She says and then pinches your cheek before giving you a couple gentle taps to the face like some sort of mafia godfather figure from the movies.\n\nAs you rub your face, Grandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou\u2019re a little surprised since you have a body right next to you, but you quickly calm down when you realize its Bobby. He\u2019s partially under the blankets with you and puts down a book he was reading.\n\n\u201cYou okay? You seem a little jumpy. Bad dream?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cEh\u2026better than others I\u2019ve had this week. We actually need to have a talk about them\u2026when we\u2026\u201d you then realize if Bobby is here then he\u2019s obviously seen Helen.\n\nYou look over to your left and see that Helen\u2019s body is no longer there and then you look over at Bobby.\n\n\u201c\u2026I meant to tell you about that\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cNo need. I can sort of guess what happened. So I take it Diana wasn\u2019t lying to me after all?\u201d\n\u201cNot completely, Helen was the initial mastermind, but Diana was definitely still going to kill me when the opportunity presented itself. Things didn\u2019t quite work out as planned as you can tell.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Still can\u2019t believe it. Helen was always so quiet and docile.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know what they say about the quiet ones. They\u2019re the most dangerous.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cGuess you know something about that.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cYeah\u2026I guess I do.\u201d You say cuddling up next to him.\n\nIt\u2019s true. You used to be a shut in wallflower at one time. That meek girl that used to hide out in the basement is long gone after this week\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cI see you\u2019re still wearing your dress as well as your ring.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah, too tired to change and the ring\u2026well I really like it.\u201d You say caressing it a bit.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026what are you doing up here anyway? Thought you were on watch duty.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cI was, and as usual you\u2019ve slept most of the day again. It\u2019s the middle of the afternoon. I\u2019m up here because I was going to get a bit of rest before catching some more sleep due to being up all night. Plus I figure the rest of the family can do the majority of grunt work for a change without me having to hoover over them. Besides, I wanted to spend time with my wife and be the first thing she sees when she wakes up. I know that hasn\u2019t been a real common thing since you got here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll say. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here too since we haven\u2019t had a chance to consummate the marriage and we really need to do that\u2026like right now.\u201d You say and your hand starts groping at Bobby\u2019s crotch.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t THAT tired.\u201d You remark after feeling his dick status.\n\u201cWell not now I\u2019m not.\u201d Bobby says and then embraces you.\n\nYou feel Bobby plunge into like you have so many times before, but this time it almost feels slightly different because you\u2019re now married to this man. Something about that makes it almost feel more\u2026\u201dspecial\u201d.\n\nYou didn\u2019t really think you\u2019d ever really feel that way over some silly ritual that joins people supposedly for life, but its probably more of the fact that you know for certain that Bobby is your soul mate.\n\nDuring the love making session, you begin to take on a more aggressive role and eventually get Bobby so he\u2019s under you and continue riding him. It\u2019s a bit different than the norm since he\u2019s usually the dominant one ramming it into you, but he isn\u2019t enjoying it any less.\n\nAnd then near the point of climax that\u2019s when it happens. A flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n\u201cShit what the hell was that?\u201d Bobby asks sitting up a bit.\n\u201cI dunno. I had my eyes closed and I just caught the tail end of the flash. Glad I didn\u2019t have them all the way open.\u201d You remark rubbing your eyes a bit.\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026I think I know\u2026\u201d Bobby says and then motions for you to get off of him.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn\u2019t a big one, but you\u2019re still a little concerned if you\u2019re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLooks like. (Sigh) Shit.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh we are. I\u2019m not even worried about that, it\u2019s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with you. Now? Well I think you know I\u2019m going to have to go and direct everyone. You know at least one of my family, if not all of them are going to come running up here asking what to do.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well such is the burden of being a leader.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. Guess I better get down there. Are you coming?\u201d\n\u201cOf course my love. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nYou and Bobby get dressed and prepare yourselves for the new world that\u2019s undoubtedly coming soon confident in the fact that whatever its going to throw at you, you\u2019ll do it together.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Matriarch of Madness\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here mom.\u201d Your son says as your personal armored truck pulls up to the site.\n\nYou look out the window and see the beautiful carnage outside. You can even hear some of the screams and crying from here.\n\n\u201cAhh, yes. Lovely.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, dad really did a number on this place after the siege was finally successful.\u201d Your son remarks.\n\u201cWell those rednecks really were asking for it by encroaching on a town that was rightfully ours. Glad to see this white trash haven finally being put to the torch and annihilated. It was a blight on the map even before the nukes hit. Well anyway let\u2019s go, I want to surprise your father.\u201d You remark getting ready to unlock the door.\n\u201cYou sure you want to get out? I mean we only just took the place and while the place is in the process of being purged completely, there were still a few of these trailer park bastards hiding in the area. In fact we believe some even ran into the nearby woods and are planning a counter attack. Not that they have any meaningful way of doing so, but still.\u201d\n\u201cYour concern for my safety is sweet Enki, but I didn\u2019t get where I am today by remaining fearful of the possibility of the unknown. Besides, I so rarely get to see your father work anymore and I\u2019d like to give him a nice surprise on his victory. I mean what do you think? Do you think when he sees me, he\u2019ll want to bend me over on the nearest pile of corpses?\u201d you ask and open up the trench coat you\u2019re wearing over your naked body and run your hands briefly down your body\n\nEnki feeling slightly uncomfortable is unsure of what to say.\n\n\u201cWell? I mean three children and not a fucking stretchmark. Years older and not even an inch of cellulite. I\u2019m not just a MILF, I\u2019m the fucking Alpha MILF.\u201d You laugh.\n\u201cUm, yeah you look pretty mom. I dunno, I don\u2019t think about you in that way.\u201d Enki remarks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poor liar son. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at me sometimes. You think I don\u2019t notice you staring at my chest or those brief glances at my ass on occasion?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d Enki starts to say before you interrupt him by waving your hand at him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay as long as you know never to touch. Your older brother Anu had to learn that lesson the hard way from your father. Glad cutting off his pinkies didn\u2019t impede his combat abilities though.\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah. I\u2019d never do that. I\u2026\u201d Enki starts to say then you interrupt him again. This time by putting a finger to his lips.\n\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re the smartest of my children. True, you\u2019re a little on the quiet and introspective side, but then so was I at your age, probably even more so\u2026and as they say it\u2019s the quiet ones you have to look out for.\u201d You say stroking his face.\n\nEnki is speechless while you continue this exercise in severely fucked up mixed messages.\n\n\u201cI love all family and I especially love all my children, however I\u2019ll only admit this to you. You\u2019re my favorite and because you\u2019re my favorite, I\u2019m going to give you something a little more\u2026just a taste if you will\u2026but not a word. It\u2019s a secret and secrets aren\u2019t special when everyone knows.\u201d\n\nYou take the same finger that was on his lips and while closing your eyes and making \u201cmmm\u201d sounds, you slowly insert it into your mouth and then back out again just as slowly.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, Enki is obviously in a mixed state of panic and being incredibly turned on. He probably doesn\u2019t know whether to run or whip his dick out and start shoving your head into his lap. Since doesn\u2019t know what your intentions are he just freezes. You\u2019re totally enjoying the way he has to be having a lot of mental conflict with this.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to go find your father. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got other things you\u2019ll need to take care of so you needn\u2019t escort me. I\u2019ve got a pistol in my coat pocket anyway, so I\u2019ll be safe. Love you son.\u201d You say with a smile and get out of the car.\n\nYou walk into what remains of the trailer park. You can\u2019t imagine this place looked much different before your family rightfully conquered it. Several of the trailers are overturned, a couple of them are on fire. In fact a couple of its inhabitants are also on fire. Bobby\u2019s younger siblings Aiden and Nadia are casually lighting up a third redneck tied to a stake when you walk over to them. They both respectfully bow when they see you.\n\n\u201cHello\u2026\u201d Aiden says.\n\u201cAunt Suzy.\u201d Nadia says.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect to\u2026\u201d Aiden adds.\n\u201c\u2026see you here.\u201d Nadia finishes.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprising Bobby, have you seen him?\u201d you ask, trying to speak over the screaming trailer trash burning alive.\n\u201cOur brother\u2026\u201d Aiden says.\n\u201c\u2026we believe\u2026\u201d Nadia says.\n\u201cis on\u2026\u201d Aiden adds.\n\u201cthe farside of the trailer park.\u201d They say in unison.\n\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll let you get back to it.\u201d You say and then they nod and go back to watching their victims burn.\n\nPassing more scenes of violence and waving to a couple of Bobby\u2019s cousins, nephews and nieces you eventually run into your youngest son Nergal who approaches with a young girl over his shoulder. He must have knocked her unconscious because she\u2019s not even struggling. Nergal may be the youngest of your children, but he\u2019s huge and towers over everyone else in your family. He\u2019d be a scary figure to most, but to you, he\u2019s your baby.\n\n\u201cMom! When did you get here?\u201d Nergal says excitedly.\n\u201cJust now. Have you seen your father?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s with Anu in that trailer near the edge of that large field over there. I think they\u2019re arguing about a possible plan to make raids on New Security next, but that was boring so I left to go have fun with what\u2019s left of the population here.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like you got a good one son.\u201d You remark and point at the girl over his shoulder.\n\u201cYeah, this will be fun for awhile, but battle we had before\u2026man it was great! You should\u2019ve seen me mom! I almost racked up as many kills as Anu!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good! Glad to hear it. Tiamat will be most pleased. Well, I\u2019m here to see your father so I\u2019ll talk to you later. Love you son.\u201d You say and leave him to his aggressive dating strategy.\n\nYou see the trailer that you guess Nergal was talking about and approach. Just before you do however, you hear several gunshots come from it. You stop for a moment and then proceed inside. You have nothing to fear. You are a chosen of Tiamat after all.\n\nWhen you enter the trailer, you see Anu standing over Bobby with a pistol in hand. Bobby lies on the floor with dead eyes and a several holes in his body. His own pistol lies near his hand. The funny thing is when you first saw Anu, you briefly thought it was Bobby. Anu looks a lot like his father back in his youthful days, minus his pinkies of course.\n\n\u201cAwww, that\u2019s a shame. I did so want to surprise your father. Looks like the pair of you surprised me instead.\u201d You remark with a frown causing Anu to turn around.\n\n\u201cHe gave me no choice mother. He was no longer a fit leader. He told me that raiding New Security would be a bad idea.\u201d\n\nYou walk up to Anu calmly and slap his face. He gives you a look of anger, but does nothing.\n\n\u201cHe was right. Raiding New Security is a horrible idea. It\u2019s too large and its defenses are strong. Better to consolidate our current holdings. We\u2019ve got a whole town to play with now.\u201d You say before Anu rudely interrupts.\n\u201cBullshit! He was just being a coward! He was getting old and weak! He was no longer fit to serve Tiamat!\u201d Anu remarks gruffly.\n\nYou slap your son again causing his anger to rise.\n\n\u201cYour father may have been many things, but never a coward. And true he was getting old, and obviously your reflexes were faster, but he wasn\u2019t weak either and he still was five times smarter than you, but then that isn\u2019t hard to do. We\u2019re not attacking New Security. End of story.\u201d You say dismissively before he grabs your arms forceful and slams you against the wall. You\u2019re hardly intimidated, Anu has always been predictable.\n\n\u201cYOU are NOT in charge here mother! I AM! I have taken what is rightfully mine! I AM the head of this family now!\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve taken what\u2019s rightfully yours eh? You gonna take me too? Or am I also too old?\u201d you ask with a raise of your eyebrow.\n\nAnu releases you and opens your trench coat revealing your naked body. He stares and marvels at it as if it\u2019s a magical treasure\u2026and for him, it just might be.\n\nHe wastes no time in taking it off you and then starts to take off his belt.\n\n\u201cGet on your knees mother.\u201d He orders which causes you to chuckle.\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll be getting on my knees, but we\u2019re not doing this the way YOU think. I came here primarily for your father.\u201d\n\u201cThe old bastard\u2019s dead in case you haven\u2019t noticed!\u201d\n\u201cAnd? That\u2019s supposed to stop me? (Sigh) you lack imagination, let me show you\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point you kneel down near Bobby\u2019s body and start pulling his bloody shirt up. Blood is everywhere, on his clothes, on the floor and still coming from his wounds. You start putting your hands in it and rubbing yourself all over until his blood is covering most of your own body.\n\n\u201cHmmmm, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m even closer to him now\u2026\u201d you say starting to finger yourself as Anu stands by watching.\n\nYou then unzip Bobby\u2019s pants and pull out his dead dick. It\u2019s actually hard, which you didn\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201cOoooh baby\u2026even in death\u2026I can still turn you on. Here, let me prove how much I still love you\u2026\u201d you say and then lower your head down.\n\nWhile you\u2019re on your hands and knees in blood and enjoying the taste your dead husband\u2019s cock, your son Anu shakes off the initial shock and spurs into action.\n\n\u201cOh fuck this. He will NOT have you in death as well! I\u2019ll show him! I\u2019ll show you both!\u201d Anu exclaims and gets behind you.

Seems like they\u2019re old enough to play by themselves.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not them we\u2019d worry about, it\u2019s the rest of this compound! While it may not look like it now, these little ones are balls of chaotic energy. Morningstar children have always needed a little extra supervision if only so they don\u2019t end up burning the entire places to the ground. However it is true they all seem to be a little more subdued today. Even Jordan is playing with his siblings rather than fighting with them.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cUm, which one\u2019s Jordan?\u201d you ask already forgetting Bobby already told you.\n\u201cJordan\u2019s the oldest boy. He\u2019s over there playing with his siblings Aiden and Nadia. They\u2019re twins as you can tell. Actually those three are also my younger brothers and sister, so I do have a bit of a duty to watch out for them. Jordan\u2019s getting to the point where I think Bobby is going to have to start training him though. He\u2019s just becoming a teenager and he really wants to be like his older brother, but sadly he isn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer. He\u2019s a still a fine boy though, he even has a bit of a crush on me which is sort of cute.\u201d Helen says with a minor giggle.\n\u201cErm\u2026yeah\u2026so what about the twins?\u201d you ask changing that last mildly disturbing remark.\n\u201cOh those two are very intelligent. They even got a mental link to each other.\u201d\n\u201cWhat really?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cReally. They often just sit across from each other nodding and occasionally changing expressions at each other. It\u2019s like they\u2019re having a conversation with their minds or something. I dunno, but sometimes it feels like they\u2019re making private jokes about all of us. Jordan in particular and while he\u2019s not the brightest, he\u2019s smart enough to know when he thinks he\u2019s being made fun of. And that\u2019s when I often have to step in and tell them not to mock their brother.\u201d\n\nAt this point both twins look in your direction and Helen\u2019s. They give a peculiar smile and then return to the game they\u2019re playing with Jordan. It\u2019s enough to make you feel a little uneasy.\n\n\u201cUm, Helen, they can\u2019t read our minds can they?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh no\u2026at least I don\u2019t think so. I mean I never even thought of that before. Oh dear, now I\u2019m going to wonder about that.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cSorry didn\u2019t mean to add to your worries Helen\u2026or my own for that matter.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not really that worried. Even if they can, we\u2019re all family anyway and they know I have no ill thoughts about them or anyone connected to it\u2026and that\u2019s going to include you too soon.\u201d Helen says and smiles.\n\nHelen next mentions that ever since Veronica and Brandon arrived, their children have pretty much been put under her care. She then points out Ione and Hannah (Who are playing another game with each other) and Leon (Who is building something and seemingly content to play by himself).\n\n\u201cGeez Helen, you look like you always got your hands full, are you really okay looking after all the children all the time?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh\u2026it\u2019s not so bad. I mean like I said, we\u2019re all family. What\u2019s family for if not to help one another? Besides, I know nobody else really wants to do or otherwise has other major responsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cWhat responsibilities do Veronica and Brandon have? I haven\u2019t seen them do anything since I got here. I mean they got three kids, and they\u2019ve obviously been taking care of them before coming here. They shouldn\u2019t just be passing them on to you just because it\u2019s convenient. You deserve to have your own time to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cReally it\u2019s okay Suzy. I like looking after all of them. Besides, I don\u2019t think the children would want someone other than myself doing it anyway. When you and Bobby have children I fully expect you\u2019ll want help on the supervision front won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026probably. I was talking about this subject a little to Bobby last night and to be honest I\u2019m still not exactly enamored with the notion of popping out a bunch of them. The idea of the pain involved isn\u2019t exactly something I\u2019m looking forward to.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think any woman looks forward to that part. It\u2019s the joy of bringing a new life into this world, raising them and loving them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026guess\u2026I dunno. Hell I\u2019m still having trouble with the concept of marriage, let alone kids.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Is it the ritual sacrifice to Tiamat that\u2019s got you a little baffled? Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to memorize any prayers, Bobby will probably tell you what to say or he\u2019ll make the appropriate chants himself.\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cWhat? Wait. I know you guys sacrifice people, but is that going to go on at the wedding?\u201d\n\u201cWell of course. It\u2019s tradition for the one to marry into this family to prove themselves to be worth of Tiamat by making a sacrifice.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you mean I\u2019M going to be the one doing it?\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah\u2026you mean Bobby didn\u2019t tell you? Oh dear. I didn\u2019t mean to ruin the surprise.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cOh it\u2019s a surprise alright.\u201d\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re worried about messing up, we\u2019ve got more than enough prisoners in the dungeon you could practice on tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cPrisoners? Dungeon? Oh geez\u2026\u201d you say and rub your hand over your head.\n\nHelen pats you on the back a bit and tries to look understanding.\n\n\u201cI take it, you\u2019ve never killed anyone before?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t! Why would I?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cI just figured you having a serial killer uncle and all\u2026plus Bobby said you helped him kill your uncle.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have a hand in that directly. Are you saying YOU\u2019VE killed someone before?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, but I\u2019m not exactly fond of it, but we all have to do our part to serve Tiamat.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Helen just told you so cheerfully and without any hesitation that she\u2019s committed murder, makes her seem a lot less harmless in your eyes.\n\n\u201cWait, so how many? When?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh not many. First time was about when I was Jordan\u2019s age. However, since Bobby is the head of the house, he mostly does it. Just like our father did before him. Diana sometimes does it, but I try to avoid doing it unless I really have to\u2026I know I shouldn\u2019t feel anything for infidels, but sometimes I can\u2019t help it. Then I try to remember that their souls are going to feed Tiamat so it\u2019s all for a good cause.\u201d\n\nThis is nuts\u2026\n\nRight now you\u2019re just wondering how deep of shit you\u2019ve gotten yourself into.\n\n\u201cI\u2026dunno if I\u2019m going to be able to do this Helen\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh don\u2019t say that! You\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Helen says trying to be supportive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I will. The most fucked up thing is, I\u2019m still more worried about having kids!\u201d\n\u201cYou still concerned about that? That will come naturally, I don\u2019t think you should worry.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno Helen. I\u2019m obviously not like you. I thought we were more similar in many ways, mainly because we both had to put up with an asshole older sister, but it\u2019s turning out we\u2019re pretty different. I mean unlike me you\u2019d obviously make a very good mother. You\u2019re nice, attentive and everything.\u201d You say.\n\nHelen\u2019s eyes light up a bit when you say that and she grabs your hand.\n\n\u201cThank you. You have no idea how touched I am right now to hear those words.\u201d She says and then leans in quick to give you a quick peck on the cheek.\n\nIt surprises the hell out of you and you recoil a bit. Helen\u2019s expression turns from one of happiness to one of worry.\n\n\u201cOh no. I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! I shouldn\u2019t have done that! By Tiamat, what was I thinking. I\u2019m so sorry Suzy!\u201d she starts saying which causes a lot of the children to start watching the pair of you.\n\nHelen stands up and begins to panic still repeating to you about how sorry she is, you think she\u2019s going to have an anxiety attack.\n\n\u201cHelen. Helen. Calm yourself. It\u2019s\u2026well\u2026it\u2019s okay. I mean I know you were just trying to be friendly and didn\u2019t mean anything else by it. You just caught me by surprise, no harm done\u2026\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026you\u2019ll have to excuse me!\u201d Helen suddenly says and runs off. You try to call her back, but she\u2019s gone.\n\nYou wonder if you should tell someone or go after her. Then one of the kids speaks to you.\n\n\u201cHey what\u2019s wrong with Aunt Helen?\u201d Hannah asks.\n\u201cShe\u2019s having a lover\u2019s quarrel with her girlfriend.\u201d Ione says smirking.\n\u201cShe is not! My sister isn\u2019t a dyke! Besides this woman is Bobby\u2019s girlfriend!\u201d Jordan remarks indignantly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because YOU like Aunt Helen!\u201d Leon says and then makes kissy noises, which causes Jordan to punch him in the arm.\n\nAt this point they look like they\u2019re going to get even more unruly, but then one of the twins speaks up.\n\n\u201cShe loves Bobby you know.\u201d Aiden says.\n\u201cYes, Aunt Helen loves Bobby very much.\u201d Nadia adds.\n\u201cYou and Diana must\u2026\u201d Aiden continues.\n\u201c\u2026die.\u201d Nadia ends.\n\nThe creepy tone they say it in causes utter silence, not to mention sends a bit of a shiver down your spine.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026are you telling me\u2026 Helen plans on killing me and Diana?\u201d you utter.\n\nThe twins just look at each other and smile. They don\u2019t say anything else and just calmly go back to their game.\n\nThey\u2019ve also managed to successfully creep out their brother and cousins who start to leave the room.\n\nMeanwhile, if Helen IS planning to kill you, you need to find out now. As much as you\u2019re hesitant to speak to them again, you have little choice but to ask the twins where their sister\u2019s room is.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026hey, where is Helen\u2019s room?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cLeft wing\u2026\u201d Aiden says.\n\u201cSecond floor\u2026\u201d Nadia adds.\n\u201cGo right then\u2026\u201d Aiden continues.\n\u201cThrough the last door.\u201d Nadia ends.\n\nGreat now they\u2019re being creepy in rhyme. They didn\u2019t even look at you the entire time.\n\nYou don\u2019t even bother to thank them, you just follow their directions. Eventually when you think you\u2019re getting close, you hear some faint crying. You slowly look in a room to your right and find Helen weeping softly to herself on her bed.\n\nShe notices you and she tries to wipe away her tears.\n\n\u201c(sniffle) Oh. You didn\u2019t need to come see to me. Really I\u2019m fine. I just acted foolishly, I apologize again for kissing you Suzy.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cUm, yeah I\u2019m not really bothered by that\u2026or rather I mean that was unexpected, but\u2026look nevermind about that. I\u2019m here about something else of a more serious nature and I\u2019m hoping we can hammer this out because whether you realize it or not, a lot of shit just got sprung on me within the last few minutes.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cIs this about the sacrifice?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is about something your creepy twin mind reading sibling just said to me. They said you love Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh\u2026well of course I love Bobby. I mean he\u2019s my older brother of course I love him.\u201d Helen says a bit nervously.\n\u201cYeah and in any other family that wouldn\u2019t mean anything more than friendship at best, but love goes to a whole other level in this family. There\u2019s also the fact they said you were going to kill me.\u201d\n\nNow Helen goes from nervous to shocked.\n\n\u201cWHAT?! They said that?!\u201d\n\u201cWell technically they said you were going to kill Diana too and they didn\u2019t say it so much as they heavily implied it, but given that they\u2019re creepy as fuck and you said they can read minds, as well as your own guilty behavior on the whole loving Bobby situation and well what the hell am I supposed to think? So is it all true?\u201d\n\nHelen just give you a sad look and then begins to tear up again and put her hands to her face.\n\n\u201cOh fuck Helen! You were lying and just plotting to kill me the entire time?! Goddamn it, had I known I was going to have to deal with not one but TWO of Bobby\u2019s murderous sisters, I would\u2019ve just stayed at home. At least I would\u2019ve only had one to deal with there!\u201d you shout.\n\nHelen tries to compose herself to address you.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. (sniffle) I wasn\u2019t lying to you. I genuinely like you and after our most recent conversation I like you even more. I mean\u2026I really like you\u2026but it is true I love Bobby. I\u2019ve always loved him\u2026(sniffle) I mean I always thought Diana was wrong for him and they were only together because she happened to be the oldest sister. Did you know I had two other older sisters and Diana killed them both for fear of competition? Everyone thinks they were accidents, but I knew the truth. Never said anything of course, I was too afraid and I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems.\u201d\n\u201cBobby never mentioned he had two dead sisters before.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really something we discuss. It was a pretty traumatic experience for everyone at the time. My dad was very upset especially since Mom had died of natural causes no long before. It was a lot of family to lose within such a short period of time.\u201d\n\u201cSo how come she didn\u2019t kill you or Nadia?\u201d\n\u201c Nadia\u2019s a twin and will most likely bond with Aiden. Plus she\u2019s much younger so no threat either way. As for me, well I was still young enough at the time when she killed my other two sisters. I guess I was just so weak in her eyes that she thought I wasn\u2019t any threat. Maybe she even knew that I loved Bobby and enjoyed flaunting it in my face. In any case things really changed when you came into the picture. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think really. Then when I finally met you, I could see why Bobby liked you. You were so nice and I want you to know I always felt like we were very similar too. You know, under appreciated in our own families. I wish you\u2019d been my sister instead of Diana.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well if I\u2019m so nice, why were you still plotting to kill me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t! I\u2026mean not really\u2026I mean\u2026(sniffle) I just had this\u2026 this\u2026 idea and I dunno\u2026 it was just my mind! I wouldn\u2019t have acted upon it! Especially not after getting to know you more! I can see you\u2019re very good for Bobby. I\u2019m genuinely hap\u2026hap\u2026(sob).\u201d\n\nAnd Helen starts crying again. At this point you\u2019re starting to wonder if she did have any intention on killing you, if she\u2019d end up apologizing for it the whole time.\n\nThe fact is though, you\u2019re still not entirely sure if she was going to do it or not. Maybe the twins were partially fucking with you. (Helen did say they liked doing that with people) Maybe Helen just had wishful thinking on her mind. It isn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t had thoughts about killing your own sister Kelly on more than one occasion. Of course the difference is, Helen\u2019s actually got some bodies under her belt to go through with such a deed.\n\nAny other right thinking person would probably be trying to leave this mad house right now, but quite frankly the more you think about it, you don\u2019t have many options and despite this fucked up situation with his sisters, you still love Bobby.\n\nAll of which means you\u2019re probably just as fucked up as the rest of them (more than you realized actually) which also means you fit in here much better than you think, you just have to figure out how to deal with everything. First of which is Helen who against all odds, you actually still feel sorry for.\n\nOf course the other option is to start getting your hands dirty now and do away with her. It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s around and she probably wouldn\u2019t put up much of a fight.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Helen", "result": "You already got one sister to worry about; you aren\u2019t about to worry about another one. If you\u2019re going to have to kill someone on your wedding day anyway, you might as well get in the practice.\n\nYou aren\u2019t exactly looking forward to doing it, but you don\u2019t see much choice. The question is how to go about it without making it look suspicious.\n\nYou take a glance around the room and see a window. You\u2019re only on the second floor though, if you pushed her out of it, it might not kill her immediately. You then think maybe you could choke her first then throw her out\u2026\n\nYes, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. Choke her and throw her out the window. It\u2019ll look like a suicide and if anyone asks, you\u2019ll just tell them the truth, she was in love with Bobby and was having a hard time coming to terms with him marrying you so out the window she went.\n\nYou walk over to Helen and sit next to her on the bed.\n\n\u201cHelen will you stop crying for one moment?\u201d you ask which causes her to comply.\n\nYou take a deep breath and exhale.\n\n\u201cOkay, You seem genuinely distraught about all this\u2026so this is going to make this harder.\u201d You say and then you punch Helen in the face as hard as you can.\n\nHelen yelps and falls back on the bed and you pounce on her immediately with your hands wrapped around her throat.\n\n\u201cSuzy\u2026no! No! You\u2026(cough)\u2026\u201d Helen squeaks out and attempts to hit you, but you ignore the pain and focus all your strength on her throat.\n\n\u201cShhhhh\u2026.Helen, stop struggling, just let go.\u201d you say wishing she wasn\u2019t making this so hard.\n\u201cBobby\u2026he\u2026help\u2026\u201d she utters with tears in her eyes.\n\nThis pitiful plea that she utters almost causes you to stop choking her, but you\u2019ve come too far now. You can\u2019t stop. The only thing you can do is get it done and try not to feel too sick about it, because you almost feel like you\u2019re going to throw up.\n\nHelen\u2019s face turns a different shade and you continue to focus on your grim work at hand. Eventually her squeals and punches disappear altogether when you successfully crush her windpipe and deprive her of any more oxygen.\n\nAnd the deed is done. You\u2019ve killed a person and you feel pretty terrible even though you know it had to be done.\n\nYou\u2019re exhausted and emotionally drained as you sit there straddling Helen\u2019s dead body. You choke back tears, though you no longer can contain the rising illness and you immediately sprint off of her and the bed and vomit into a small wastepaper can in her room. You don\u2019t even think about the fact that you\u2019re going to have to clean it or all the loud noise your retching is making.\n\nNot that it mattered since Diana was apparently listening in and spying on you both the whole time.\n\nWhen you lift your head up out of the trash can still recovering from your bout of sickness, you look up just in time to see Diana\u2019s swing a bat upside your head. You collapse on the floor, tipping over the trash can causing it to spill your sick back on to you.\n\n\u201cGuess you didn\u2019t want any more competition huh? You had the right idea though and I do thank you for saving me the trouble. Now I can legitimately blame Helen\u2019s death on you and I was merely coming to the aid of my poor late sister. I can see I was just being tested\u2026Tiamat\u2019s glorious chaos sure works in mysterious ways.\u201d Diana says and then hits you in the head with another bat swing.\n\nAnd then another\u2026and then another\u2026and then another\u2026", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Let her live", "result": "Maybe it\u2019s stupid or weakness, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to kill Helen based on heavy suspicion.

You seem genuinely distraught about all this\u2026so I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and take you at your word that you had no solid intention on killing me and it was just a fleeting thought that we all have once in awhile. I mean I\u2019ve had them too.\u201d\n\nHelen looks a little happier when you say that.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m so glad you feel that way Suzy\u2026(sniff)\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not finished! I AM going to be keeping an eye on you though and I think it\u2019s going to take me awhile to fully trust you.\u201d You say which causes her to nod rapidly.\n\u201cI\u2026I understand. Wha\u2026what about Bobby?\u201d\n\u201cWell that is the question isn\u2019t it? I guess I could threaten you. However, that\u2019s really not going to help matters and the heart wants what the heart wants. Can\u2019t really stop that\u2026well other than killing that person, but I think neither one of us wants to go that route. Let me ask you this though, does he possibly know already how you feel?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I don\u2019t believe so. He\u2019s either been too into Diana or too into you, to pay any serious attention to me in that way. So no, I do not believe he knows.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to tell him?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh! No! No, I can\u2019t! Especially not now! That will just mess things up for you! I don\u2019t want to be in the way! Please Suzy, don\u2019t tell Bobby about my real feelings either. I\u2026I\u2019ve come to deal with the reality that Bobby will never be mine. Just wasn\u2019t meant to be. I can be\u2026 happy without him as long as I know you\u2019ll be making him happy.\u201d Helen says and then tries to smile, but it doesn\u2019t last long.\n\nThat was incredibly hard for her to say. You know her heart is probably breaking in a million pieces on the inside. You almost want to console her, but then you have to remember she might have been plotting to kill you.\n\n\u201cOkay then\u2026so are we good?\u201d you ask unsure of what else to address.\n\u201cYes, Suzy. We\u2019re good\u2026um can I just have a hug?\u201d Helen asks.\n\nThis family just gets weirder and weirder\u2026\n\n\u201cA hug?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I know you don\u2019t trust me, but you\u2019re still willing to give me a chance. That alone is more kindness than my own sister Diana has ever shown me. I feel closer to you than I ever have with her. I mean I guess I understand if you don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d Helen says a little sadly.\n\nYou look at her sideways wondering if this is some sort of trick, but if you\u2019re going to go with this building trust route AND if it\u2019ll make Helen feel better, you can do a hug.\n\nYou go to Helen and sit beside her on her bed who gloms on to you immediately. As you reluctantly hug back, Helen exhales as if a big weight has been lifted.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much this means to me Suzy\u2026\u201d she says.\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYou smell pretty and feel so soft and warm.\u201d She then says squeezing you a little tighter.\n\u201cUh\u2026okay\u2026I think I should be getting back to Bobby now.\u201d You remark and start to let go though it feels like Helen doesn\u2019t really want to let go.\n\u201cOkay. You go back to Bobby, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s wondering where you are. I\u2019ll be fine. Thank you for being so understanding. I\u2019ll never forget this.\u201d\n\nHelen waves good-bye with a smile as you leave her room. What a strange girl.\n\nAs you make your way back towards the stairs, you realize that you didn\u2019t address the possibility that Helen might have planned to kill Diana as well, not that you care since you\u2019d rather she be completely out of way. Even if Helen did have that plan, it\u2019s clear that if she\u2019s telling the truth about having too much feelings about killing you, she\u2019s unlikely to kill her sister due to whatever fucked up battered sibling syndrome she has.\n\nBesides, as far as you\u2019re concerned Bobby\u2019s supposed to take care of the Diana situation or he will if he expects you to sacrifice someone on a slab on the wedding day.\n\nWhen you get downstairs the some of the family members are all eating. You don\u2019t see Bobby though.\n\n\u201cHey Veronica have you seen Bobby?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh, I think he went to your room to look for you. Figured you\u2019d be there. I think he\u2019s pretty upset about what just happened with William and Aaron.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\n\u201cThey just left the compound. Not exactly sure what William told Bobby, but he and Aaron are both gone. Brandon\u2019s outside closing up the front gate.\u201d Veronica says and shovels more food into her mouth.\n\nGreat, more drama. You make the long trek back to the bedroom\u2026\n\nSure enough, you find Bobby looking slightly mopey on the bed. These Morningstars sure are a miserable lot today.\n\n\u201cHey Bobby.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey. Where have you been?\u201d Bobby asks\n\u2018Bonding with your sister Helen. You know, the nice one.\u201d\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s good. Glad to hear something going well\u2026\u201d Bobby says with his voice sounding like he isn\u2019t as happy about that as he should be.\n\u201cOkay, I already heard about William and Aaron, but what are you really upset about?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m bothering trying to hold this family together! Most of them aren\u2019t even here. Two of them just left. One of them hates me now, and the rest aren\u2019t exactly sterling examples of Tiamat\u2019s Chosen. In fact the ones that are here are probably here because it\u2019s safe and filled with enough supplies to live comfortably.\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\u201cNothing I suppose, but supporting about bunch of freeloaders wasn\u2019t really part of my plan to honor Tiamat.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe you need to change your damn plan. I mean its still early, but if you really feel like someone isn\u2019t pulling their weight around here, then you need to just kick their asses out, family or not. I mean you\u2019re the boss around here and your word is supposed to be law.\u201d\n\nBobby sits up a bit as you continue to speak.\n\n\u201cLook, you know you\u2019re a leader and you know the head of this family. So you can\u2019t give into all this self-doubt. You NEEDED to lay down the law to your sister Diana and you did it. In fact, speaking of which, what exactly IS going to be done about her? Because whatever you said you know that\u2019s just going to be a temporary fix. Now I think you KNOW what you\u2019re going to have to do with her, but your past with her is preventing you from doing it.\u201d\n\nBobby continues to listen intently.\n\n\u201cLove isn\u2019t one-sided Bobby, and if I\u2019m going to have to ultimately submit to your beliefs and everything that goes with it including murdering innocent people\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026you know about the sacrifice on the wedding day?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cYeah and thanks a lot for keeping me in the dark about it. But it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve gotten over it. I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about things and how this marriage is going to go if it\u2019s going to work. I\u2019m willing to go all in, but you\u2019re going to have to do likewise and fix this problem with Diana permanently. How is up to you, but she is NOT going to be here.\u201d\n\nBobby looks a little overwhelmed by your ultimatum. He\u2019s never heard you speak like this before and really; you\u2019re a little surprised you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying yourself. You\u2019re rolling the dice and betting everything here. You think you\u2019ve got the inner strength to go through with all this, you just hope that Bobby proves to be just as strong.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you are the love of my life and what you\u2019ve just told me just confirms that Tiamat\u2019s chaos did favor me when I met you. You\u2019re right. I know I have to do something more permanent with my sister Diana. I\u2019ll come to a decision tomorrow though. I think I need the rest of the day to recover from all the shit I\u2019ve already had to go through. It\u2019s not even night yet!\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay. I understand. Well, should we go eat with the rest of the family?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not really feeling it right now. I\u2019d rather just spend time with you.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d You remark.\n\nYou and Bobby kiss each other, which then soon leads to something a lot more intense.\n\nA little later after your pleasant round of passion, Bobby says he should go tell one of his family members to take the night watch and have a long conversation with all of them.\n\n\u201cWell good luck on that front.\u201d You say as you briefly check your phone out of curiosity.\n\u201cDid someone call?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cNo, just curious. I was wondering if any of my family tried to contact me given how with the craziness going on in town recently. Guess I\u2019m not surprised nobody cared to call. Not mad about it though, just one more confirmation that this is my new family and home now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell other than you know who, it seems like you\u2019ve gotten along with the rest of my family. Sounds like you\u2019ve really gotten along with Helen. So what did you two talk about anyway?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cOh\u2026 you know\u2026girl stuff.\u201d You say with a slight smile, which cause Bobby to snicker a bit.\n\n\u201cAlright, you two have your little secrets. Just as long as you\u2019re getting along. Love you.\u201d Bobby says opening the door.\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d You say as he leaves.\n\nYou enjoy the rest of your evening in solitude until you eventually fall asleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\n\u201cDue to new developments, today\u2019s contest has been canceled.

You were starting to feel insulted by the implications of yourself participating in all these phallic food-eating contests.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re still a little fond of being cheered for, so you stand up and take a bow for your fans.\n\nNo sooner have you done that, when your surroundings immediately change to that of a blasted wasteland. There is nothing around you save for burned out buildings in the distance and dead landscape. Reminds you a bit of a video game you once played.\n\n\u201cYou know, the entire world is soon going to look like this\u2026how I wish I could be young and alive to experience the uncertainty and chaos that is going to shape the years to follow.\u201d You hear a voice say.\n\nYou turn around and see Bobby\u2019s grandmother again.

You survived a lot longer than I thought you would, maybe you are worthy of my grandson after all. You even are starting to manipulate him a bit, that\u2019s good. The true leaders in Tiamat\u2019s service have always been women anyway. I swear if it wasn\u2019t for us prodding them in the right direction every now and then, most men would be content just jacking off to pass the time. Still, you aren\u2019t quite there yet. I think today should prove to quite interesting. Survive today and you might just meet Misty yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I want some answers, who the hell is Misty, and what\u2019s going to happen today? Is Helen going to kill me?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cHelen? Oh yes my submissive co-dependent grand daughter. Yes, that was sort of an interesting way you dealt with her\u2026\u201d Grandma Morningstar replies.\n\u201cSo is she going to try to kill me or not?\u201d\n\u201cWho said she ever was? You just came to that conclusion yourself. She told you she was never going to try to kill you. I suppose it\u2019s up to you to believe her or not. I think the better question is, do you like her?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo you like her? Not a hard question blondie.\u201d Grandma Morningstar says tapping on her cane.\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike her despite everything\u2026I mean growing up in this family is prone to make her a little fucked up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, well do you think she\u2019s pretty?\u201d\n\u201cPretty?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sheesh you go fucking deaf blondie?

I mean I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to kill her on suspicion. But yes, I suppose the fact that I see some of myself in her did cause me to be a little sympathetic to her.\u201d\n\u201cSo if you fucked her\u2026it would almost be like fucking yourself right?\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026what? What are you trying to get at?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh I think you know EXACTLY what I\u2019m trying to get at. It\u2019s okay Suzy, I\u2019m making no judgments. The female form is a beautiful thing. Well anyway you\u2019ll find out what\u2019s in store for you today soon. As for Misty, well why don\u2019t you put some thought into it. I mean it\u2019s pretty simple even for you blondie.\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother replies with slight distain.\n\u201cWell can you at least tell me what\u2019s deal with all these contests in my dreams?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I really don\u2019t know anything about that. If you\u2019re lucky and actually meet Misty, maybe you can ask her, but I just assumed you really liked dreaming about sucking dick...in a symbolic way I guess. Hmm, come to think of it this would explain why Bobby\u2019s so enamored with you. Maybe you aren\u2019t a whore blondie, but you sure got the mouth of one. It\u2019s almost as if it was a highway for oral sex.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take offense blondie. It\u2019s a good thing. Suck a man\u2019s dick right, and you can practically get him to do ANYTHING for you. I mean you got natural talent. Hell, maybe even Tiamat blessed you with it so you stood an equal chance against Diana. Now that girl, as much as she loves Bobby, she just can\u2019t suck a dick properly. Bad gag reflex, slightly oversized teeth, I dunno. Tiamat works in whimsical ways I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you even know all\u2026nevermind I don\u2019t want to hear anymore.\u201d You say.\n\nBobby\u2019s grandmother ignores you though and continues to speak.\n\n\u201cStill, Bobby always did have a slight obsession for blowjobs. He likes them a lot more than he\u2019s probably told you.\"\n\u201cGah! I\u2019m done listening!\u201d you shout feeling increasingly uncomfortable about hearing Bobby\u2019s grandmother talk about his sexual interests.\n\u201cOh, alright Miss Prude. I\u2019m rambling and it\u2019s time for you to go anyway. See ya Deep Throat!\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother cackles again and then raises her cane and all your surroundings go black\u2026\n\nAnd then you wake up.\n\n\u201cSomething bad is going to happen today.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\n(Then again why should today be any different from the rest of this week?)\n\nYou look around and see nobody in the room (Save for Bobby\u2019s grandmother\u2019s portrait staring like a gargoyle). Looks like Bobby woke up before you as usual. You look at the time on your phone and see you\u2019ve actually slept until the afternoon.\n\nWhile the normal thing for you to do would be to just stay in your room and avoid everyone, but given your recent dream, you think your best bet might be to be a little proactive today.\n\nAfter going through your usual routine of washing up and getting dressed you head down to the main living area where you know everyone usually gathers.\n\nBefore you get there you bump into Helen, who looks a bit harried and is carrying a pistol in one hand. You tense up immediately.\n\n\u201cThere you are, good. Saves me time\u2026\u201d she says.\n\u201cUh\u2026Helen \u2026\u201d you start to say and back away slowly.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Helen looks down at her pistol.\n\u201cOH! Shit! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to scare you! I didn\u2019t come to do anything to you! Here, you can take it, if it makes you feel better, but we need to go!\u201d she exclaims and hands you the pistol.\n\nYou snatch the weapon from her and eye her suspiciously. She gets worried at first that you\u2019re going be the one to shoot her, but then just continues to explain in greater detail about what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAaron came back and he\u2019s threatening to drive an army truck through the front gate if we all don\u2019t leave the compound. He claims that we\u2019re defying Tiamat by not embracing the chaos outside. Bobby\u2019s been trying to negotiate with him through the intercom, but he thinks we\u2019re going to have no option but to open fire on Aaron.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell did he get an army truck? Is William with him?\u201d\n\u201cApparently the town has been in a state of martial law since yesterday and the National Guard have taken over according to Aaron\u2019s ranting. I guess he stole one. I don\u2019t think William is with him. Anyway Bobby wants you to be safe so follow me to where all the children...\u201d\n\nLoud shouting by Bobby in the distance suddenly interrupts Helen. You immediately rush towards where he might be located despite the protests by the Helen that you need to come with her though she just runs along with you.\n\nYou soon manage to catch up with the most of the family (Save for the younger children and Diana) who are standing in the foyer with their weapons ready and Bobby who has opened the front door.\n\n\u201cAaron, I tried being reasonable. YOU left here without permission, but that was fine because it\u2019s obvious you didn\u2019t feel happy here. There are several paths to Tiamat\u2019s glory and you obviously had your own ideas about which one you should pick. Anyone here is free to leave, but NOBODY is going to be forced to leave due to your threats! Again, if you try coming in here, you\u2019re going to be shot down like a fucking dog and I\u2019ll personally perform Tiamat\u2019s ritual of desecration over your stinking body so your soul NEVER enters Timat\u2019s glory!\u201d Bobby shouts and walks out with his rifle drawn. Bobby\u2019s brother Jordan is the first one who cautiously follows afterwards and then everyone else slowly walks towards the door as well. You don\u2019t think anyone has even paid any attention to you or Helen (who keeps pulling on you to leave).\n\n\u201cMy soul is already with Tiamat! You can\u2019t do shit about it ritual boy! If you unworthy fucks won\u2019t embrace chaos as Tiamat intended, then I\u2019m gonna bring it to you!\u201d Aaron shouts through a bullhorn, which is followed by a laugh.\n\nThe truck revs up and Bobby orders everyone to open fire. You and Helen are still inside at this point so you don\u2019t actually do so and just hang back as you watch Aaron mow through the gate followed by a hail of bullets peppering the oncoming truck.\n\nThe truck swerves hard to the left smashes into Brandon\u2019s parked vehicle. You can hear him swearing about it. Meanwhile you also see Jordan jumping up and down in victory and running over to the wrecked truck.\n\n\u201cYeah! We got that bastard! Whoo!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cHey Jordan, get the fuck back here, don\u2019t go off ahead like that by yourself!\u201d Bobby shouts.\n\u201cAw, it\u2019s fine, he didn\u2019t survive that!\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when Aaron proves Jordan wrong, starting by recovering from his crash and shooting several holes into Jordan. Then he follows up by throwing several grenades out the truck window.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d Bobby shouts and everyone runs back, but not before several explosions occur. Nobody is killed, but everyone scrambles and on the ground crawling for cover. Bobby himself crawls behind cover of another parked vehicle and continues to fire in the direction of the truck.\n\nHelen now really tugs at you saying you need to come with her where its safe, but you wonder if you should try to help Bobby considering he\u2019s the only one currently trying to kill Aaron. Everyone else has completely retreated and is even running past you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Bobby", "result": "This is the man you\u2019ve chosen to marry for better or worse. If you aren\u2019t going to help him in a matter of life or death then that wouldn\u2019t say much for your commitment.\n\nBesides, if he gets killed this whole compound is going to turn to shit and you\u2019d no doubt be at the bottom of it, assuming Aaron doesn\u2019t kill you all first.\n\n\u201cHelen, you go see to the young ones, I\u2019m going to stand by Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my choice, I\u2019ll be fine! Now go!\u201d\n\nHelen is a little unsure, but complies with your wishes.\n\n\u201cBe careful, Suzy.\u201d Helen says and leaves.\n\nYou rush outside towards Bobby who is still taking cover behind a car and firing upon the Aaron. He sees you out the corner of his eye while still keeping an eye on the direction of the truck.\n\n\u201cKeep your head down, I think Aaron escaped out the passenger door of the truck and is hiding behind Brandon\u2019s car now. Where the hell did you come from anyway? I told Helen to go get you and the younger children to a safer location when Aaron showed up.\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019m showing you that I\u2019m not just going to let you do this shit alone. I\u2019m with you all the way. No hiding with Helen and the kids, no matter what you say.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re interrupted by gunfire on your position and Aaron ranting.\n\n\u201cYou think you can stop what\u2019s coming by hiding? Hah! People are already fucking EATING each other out there! Shit, I\u2019ll be doing you a favor by killing you now. Actually now that I think about\u2026 your blonde bitch looks like a fine piece of ass in more way than one!\u201d Aaron shouts and starts laughing maniacally and then throws another grenade your way.\n\nYou and Bobby have no choice but to leave your position and make a dash back to the house entrance. It\u2019s somewhat of a minor miracle that you and Bobby aren\u2019t hit by any of the bullets he fires at you. You manage to get inside just as the grenade goes off and adds to the total of destroyed vehicles outside.\n\nYou and Bobby are on the floor though Bobby has partially managed to cover you with his own body.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did he do, rip off the entire National Guard armory?\u201d you say as Bobby back kicks the front door shut from his prone position.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo more explosions are heard on the left side of compound. Aaron is apparently throwing explosives through the windows now.\n\n\u201cShit, I hope nobody ran and hid over there.\u201d You remark as the pair of you start to get up off the floor.\n\u201cWhere the fuck IS everyone anyway? Nice to know I can REALLY count on these fuckers when the going gets tough. Why the fuck am I even bothering again? Fuck!\u201d Bobby yells in frustration.\n\nYou understand his anger, but it\u2019s probably not the best time for a rant.\n\n\u201cBobby, calm yourself. You can yell at those idiots later, but right now all that matters is that I\u2019m here helping you okay?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah\u2026okay. Just wish we had more reliable help. (Sigh) To think, the only thing I was concerned about was exiling Diana today.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s the game plan?\u201d you ask slightly disappointed that Bobby\u2019s decision was to exile Diana rather than death, but you aren\u2019t entirely surprised. Still, there\u2019s always the hope that Aaron does kill her.\n\nBobby quickly snaps back to the situation at hand.\n\n\u201cWell it sounds like he\u2019s stopped with the explosives, or maybe he\u2019s just fishing out more. I\u2019d say the safest bet is to get to the second floor and shoot him through one of the windows. No point in going back out the front door when we can get the vantage point.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know he\u2019s still outside, he might\u2019ve already entered house through one of the holes he\u2019s undoubtedly made with his grenades.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHe could try for the armory, though he\u2019s still gotta come through this way if he wants to go there. Given his state of mind though he might also try to do something like run upstairs and kill all the children for fun. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to try to access the prisoner\u2019s dungeon and set them all free. It is on the left wing after all. (Sigh) As much as I hate splitting up, I\u2019m going to need you to stay here and guard the foyer just in case he tries to sneak through here.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cI really think I should come with you. Splitting up is always a bad idea in these situations.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it either, but it\u2019s a big house and we need to cast a wide net to deal with this asshole.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cOkay Bobby, I\u2019ll stay here, but please be careful.\u201d You remark.\n\"I'll be fine, you just keep a look out and remember, if you see him, don't talk, just shoot. Oh and if any of my cousins ever come out of hiding and pass through here, tell them to fucking help you.\" Bobby says and then kisses you before heading to the left wing of the house.\n\nSoon after Bobby leaves, you put your back against one of the walls and start keeping an eye on the doorways.\n\nMinutes pass and you start to get a little nervous. Not a lot, but enough that you move from your spot and check the left doorway.\n\nThen you briefly hear the sounds of rushing footsteps behind you and you don\u2019t even get to completely turn around before you feel a crushing blow to the side of your head.\n\nYou crumple to the floor on your knees and then another blow to your head causes you to collapse flat on the floor and lose grip of your pistol. A pair of blurry hands quickly grabs it from you.\n\n\u201cYou and that traitorous bitch of a sister of mine think you can take Bobby after he exiles me? I heard the pair of you conspiring together yesterday in her room after Bobby ripped my heart out. Fucking cunt.\u201d Diana says and points it at you.\n\nYou weakly attempt to grab at Diana who kicks you in the face, your already bleeding head hits the floor.\n\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019d savor this moment. Maybe even keep you alive longer to enjoy torturing you a bit more, but I think under the circumstances, putting you down now is the more efficient plan. Haven\u2019t decided if I should help Bobby yet\u2026or perhaps even Aaron\u2026guess I\u2019ll surprise them both.\u201d\n\nDespite Diana aiming for your head and being at this close range she manages to completely fuck up her shot and hit you in the throat instead which doesn\u2019t kill you instantly.\n\n\u201cShit, well I guess it\u2019s good my aim isn\u2019t that great, I got to see you suffer a little more after all. Say hello to my sister in fucking traitor\u2019s hell. I will be laughing at you both within Tiamat\u2019s glorious chaos!\u201d Diana shouts as you gurgle, choke and finally die.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Go with Helen", "result": "Getting into a fistfight with Diana is one thing, but you\u2019re definitely not up to dealing with this crazy asshole. You just hope Bobby is up for dealing with him though apparently Helen thinks so.\n\n\u201cCome on! Bobby can handle this, but we need to get to the children where it\u2019s safe!\u201d Helen exclaims and you start to follow her.\n\nThe pair of you run upstairs away from the sounds of shouting and gunfire. You soon reach the top and follow Helen through a corridor doorway.\n\nAnd then Helen nearly gets bashed in the head with a bat when she passes through an entryway. She does take a hit to the shoulder though which causes her to fall to the floor in pain. Diana steps out from the corner she was hiding behind and then rushes at you.\n\nYou\u2019re caught off guard and point your pistol at Diana, and actually manage to fire a shot, but unfortunately Diana\u2019s smashes your arm with the bat away from her direction so your shot goes wild. Hardly matters since between the kickback of the pistol and the pain you end up dropping the gun entirely.\n\nWith you unarmed and Helen still clutching her arm in pain, Diana\u2019s head swivels back and forth rapidly, to make sure neither one of you are going to suddenly lunge at her, though she\u2019s also eyeing the dropped pistol too.\n\n\u201cAfter Bobby ripped my heart out I went upstairs to my room and overheard you two bitches conspiring against me. Didn\u2019t know you had it in you Helen. I always knew you loved Bobby, but always figured you\u2019d be too weak to do shit about it. Guess that\u2019s my fault for showing you mercy.\u201d Diana remarks.\n\nWhile Diana\u2019s ranting to her sister, you attempt to make a play for the gun, but Diana swings her bat at you, nearly hitting you in the face. You step back just in time.\n\n\u201cAnd you. You certainly have proved yourself the stereotype of dumb blonde, because if you actually bought that bullshit that my sister fed you, you\u2019re stupider than I thought you were. You actually think she\u2019s gonna just let you have Bobby? She\u2019s gonna backstab you the same way she backstabbed me.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she backstabbed you because you were a fucking bully to her, you ever think of that?\u201d you say.\n\u201cBully? She oughta be grateful I didn\u2019t kill her ass and instead made her strong enough for her to grow a spine to betray me in the first place! Hey! Where the fuck you goin\u2019?\u201d Diana remarks when she turns her head to see Helen getting up to run away.\n\nDiana throws her bat at Helen\u2019s legs, which successfully hit and trip her up. Diana then goes for the pistol and that\u2019s when you pounce and manage to tackle her. The pair of you are soon rolling on the floor again, punching, scratching and kneeing each other.\n\nYou both try to go for the pistol on several occasions, but neither of you gets the advantage, in fact when Diana finally does, you knock it out of her hand and it goes sprawling and down the stairs to the first floor.\n\n\u201cBah! I don\u2019t need a gun to do my work anyhow! I\u2019ll enjoy it even more killing you with my bare hands!\u201d Diana remarks and lands a good punch on you and then she slams the back of your head into the floor causing you to become a little dazed. She\u2019d do more, but then Helen comes up from behind her with the bat in hand.\n\nUnfortunately for Helen, Diana hears Helen and catches Helen\u2019s feeble swing and stops the bat from actually hitting her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna so enjoy hurting you little sister\u2026\u201d Diana exclaims and attempts to rip the bat from Helen\u2019s hand. Helen\u2019s grip is strong enough that Diana doesn\u2019t succeed so instead Diana uses Helen\u2019s weight against her and pushes the bat towards Helen as hard as she can. Helen, not expecting this, loses her footing on her already bruised legs and falls back on the nearby wall, dropping the bat entirely, which rolls away.\n\nDiana gets off of you, to take care of her sister who at this point is begging to not be hurt.\n\n\u201cDiana, please\u2026this isn\u2019t my fault\u2026Bobby chose Su\u2026\u201d Diana squeaks.\n\u201cBOBBY CHOSE ME FIRST! BOBBY IS MINE! HE\u2019S ALWAYS BEEN MINE BY BIRTH! You fucking little weakling traitorous bitch! Had you just stayed in line, I might\u2019ve even been kind enough to let Bobby face fuck you on your birthday, but the only fucking you\u2019re going to get now is in your ass because I\u2019m going knee deep in it!\u201d\n\nAt this point Helen squeals in fear and curls up in a tight ball while Diana starts kicking the hell out of her. Meanwhile you\u2019re starting to come around a bit more. Things are still a bit dizzy for you and you\u2019re a bit wobbly standing up, but you manage it.\n\nYou attempt to make a run (or fast paced wobble at any rate) for the bat, but Diana stops you before you can even reach it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so bottled blonde bitch!\u201d Diana says and knocks you to the floor and then follows up with a kick.\n\nDiana gets on top of you and while you struggle to fight her off, she slaps away your attempts and wraps her hands around your throat.\n\n\u201cYou are going to very dark place and I\u2019m going to enjoy putting you there.\u201d She remarks and then she starts doing some weird chanting, similar to the shit Bobby says at times when you\u2019re having sex with him, but this isn\u2019t nearly as fun.\n\nYou try to pry her hands off your throat, but her grip is like iron. You start to lose consciousness.\n\nYou try one more time to get her off of you by punching her in the face, but your swing isn\u2019t strong enough and Diana is just too determined to end your life.\n\nDiana\u2019s face gets blurry, you choke and then everything goes black.\n\nEverything is black for what probably seems to be forever. There is nothing. No fluffy cloud heaven, no lake of fire, and definitely not any Tiamat.\n\nThen you feel a sensation around your mouth and the sensation of air going in. It\u2019s pleasant enough that you instinctively throw your arms out to embrace Bobby. When you open your eyes you find Helen\u2019s face lip locked to yours.\n\nAfter a few seconds you actually freak out about it being her instead of Bobby.\n\n\u201cH\u2026hey! What the hell?!\u201d you say and push Helen off of you.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Suzy, but you were unconscious and I was resuscitating you.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t breathing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUm, well it didn\u2019t look like you were. I mean Diana choked you out before I got to her.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I was just unconscious. (cough) You didn\u2019t check to see if I was still breathing first? You just wrapped your (cough) lips around mine and started blowing into my mouth?\u201d\n\u201cI panicked and didn\u2019t want to waste time checking! I didn\u2019t want you to die!\u201d Helen exclaims.\n\nWell you can\u2019t really fault her for trying to save your life.\n\n\u201c(Cough) Well thanks Helen. So where is Diana?\u201d you ask rubbing your throat which still hurts like hell.\n\u201cOver to your right.\u201d Helen points out and sure enough you turn your head and see Diana laying face down on the floor.\n\u201cI smacked her in the head with the bat when she was choking you. I dunno if I killed her. I didn\u2019t check to see if she was still breathing either, I was too busy worrying about you. Are you sure you\u2019re feeling okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You slowly starting to stand. It takes some effort, but Helen helps you up. Your whole body hurts.\n\nYou stare at Diana\u2019s body and see her chest briefly rise and fall, so it looks like she\u2019s still alive, just unconscious. Though you\u2019re severely tempted to put an end to that, but you\u2019ve got a better idea.\n\n\u201cYou think Bobby would let me sacrifice Diana?\u201d you ask which takes her a little by surprise.\n\u201cUm\u2026I don\u2019t know. I mean after we explain what she did, I can\u2019t see he\u2019d have any objections. There are no rules against it.\u201d Helen replies.\n\u201cGood, it\u2019s my fucking wedding day, I should at least get to pick\u2026well shit looks like she\u2019s waking up already.\u201d You remark when you see Diana begin to stir.\n\n\u201cHey, guess what Diana, you\u2019re going to be at my wedding after all. You\u2019re going to be one of the most important people there in fact. Helen, do you have anything to tie this bitch up with?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cUh, yeah I think I know where there are some handcuffs and there\u2019s always duct tape laying around somewhere.\u201d Helen replies.\n\u201cWell go get them. I\u2019ll keep an eye on Diana.\u201d You say and pick up the nearby bat.\n\nWhile Helen goes running off, you standby staring at Diana who is giving you the stare of death, but is obviously still in lady pain.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna just let you throw me on the altar and shove a knife in me like some fucking sheep? You gotta another thing coming blondie.\u201d She remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see as you have really a choice at this point.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cBullshit, I still got a few choices. Like for instance, I could rush you right now, take that bat from you and bash your brains in with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou think you still got the strength for that, let alone the speed?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make it, maybe I won\u2019t, but we\u2019re gonna see\u2026\u201d Diana says and spits blood from her mouth.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to put out Diana\u2019s lights again, you suddenly hear a very loud explosion which sounds like it\u2019s coming from the left side of the house. You\u2019ve been so busy with Diana, you\u2019ve completely forgotten that Bobby\u2019s been battling it out with Aaron elsewhere in the house. Your concerns are briefly for him instead.\n\nHowever, with this very brief distraction, Diana takes advantage and lunges at you and the pair of you are struggling with the damn bat again.\n\nDiana seems to be fueled by some sort of unnatural rage at this point, because she\u2019s certainly more formidable than the first time you fought with her in the dining room, or maybe she\u2019s not underestimating you like she did last time. In any case, you need an advantage, which is either going to be the bat you\u2019re currently still struggling with, or the gun which you know is still somewhere on the stairwell.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue to struggle with Diana", "result": "You don\u2019t have time to go hunting for a gun when Diana\u2019s already at your throat.

She\u2019s going to have it soon, but since she\u2019s so focused on the upper body, she\u2019s not really paying attention to her lower defenses.\n\nYou let go of the bat, which causes her to fall backwards slightly. Not enough to fall, but enough to put her a bit off balance and back up from you. Within this brief window of relief you follow up with your next attack and as hard as you can you kick her RIGHT IN THE PUSSY.\n\nDiana\u2019s grip on the bat fails and you\u2019re quick to retrieve it while she\u2019s grabbing her girl parts in agony.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t dye my hair, I\u2019m a fucking natural blonde, you fucking bitch!\u201d you say and smash Diana\u2019s nose in with the pommel of the bat.

Come on let\u2019s tie this bitch up, I just heard an explosion in the house and I want to go help Bobby.\u201d\n\nYou and Helen waste no time in handcuffing Diana\u2019s hands behind her back and then duct taping her ankles together to the point where the bottom part of her legs look like a mummy. Of course when she won\u2019t stop swearing and cursing at you both, you duct tape her mouth shut as well.\n\n\u201cOkay, she should be secure. I\u2019m going to grab that gun that\u2019s probably somewhere still on the stairs and check on Bobby.

Then when you get to the ground floor you start cautiously making your way to the left wing of the house. You still haven\u2019t seen anyone yet.\n\nThe smell of gunpowder and smoke is in the air of this part of the house and peering in one of the rooms you see the results of what you assume is from grenades. The room is charred, blackened and wrecked. Whatever items were in this room have been completely destroyed and there is now a large hole allowing direct entry from the outside to the inside.\n\nYou also notice small splotches of blood on the floor causing an easier to follow trail. Though who\u2019s blood it is you have no idea. You can only hope it\u2019s Aaron\u2019s.\n\n\u201cShit, I really hope you\u2019re alright Bobby.\u201d You say to yourself and begin to follow the trail.\n\nYou pass through a series of rooms to get to your destination.

You wonder if this is the dungeon that was mentioned to you in passing before.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a little reluctant to go down there, this is where the blood trail leads. The smell emanating from that direction isn\u2019t pleasant though it sounds silent down there. You slowly walk down the steps.\n\nThe closer you get to the bottom, the smell becomes worse and when you finally get to the bottom there is no mistaking that this is indeed the dungeon, but it\u2019s a complete wreck.\n\nThere are body parts, gore and blood all over the place. A few of the cages you see are destroyed and at the farthest wall there is a large chunk taken out of it. Apparently there was more explosive fun down here.\n\nAnd sitting close to one of the more intact cages on a sturdy looking chair is Bobby looking down at the floor. Most of his clothing is covered blood and looks a bit dejected, but doesn\u2019t look hurt so that\u2019s good at least.\n\n\u201cBobby? Bobby are you okay?\u201d you ask causing him to look up.\n\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m fine\u2026what happened to you?\u201d Bobby says and starts getting up.\n\nYou didn\u2019t think about how you might look after coming back from your tussle with Diana. You\u2019re probably sporting a few cuts and bruises of your own.\n\n\u201cOh, I had a knock down drag out with your sister Diana. Tried to kill me and Helen this time. We took care of it though.\u201d\n\u201cShe dead?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I decided if I have to sacrifice someone on my wedding day, I\u2019m requesting\u2026no I\u2019m demanding that it be her. So we\u2019ve got her tied up for that purpose.\u201d\n\nBobby doesn\u2019t respond in too much surprise at your request.\n\n\u201cWell, I think after everything you\u2019ve gone through, I think you deserve that right. It\u2019s just as well anyway considering Aaron\u2019s crazy ass just blew up all the prisoners.\u201d Bobby says with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t we win and everything has worked out?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, it did\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026I dunno. I guess some of Aaron\u2019s ranting just got to me that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWell what did he say?\u201d\n\u201cOh he just kept accusing me of not really being dedicated to Tiamat. I dunno, I know I shouldn\u2019t pay any attention to it, but I can\u2019t help but think he might have had a point. Maybe I am a little caught up in ritual\u2026but still I THINK it\u2019s important to revere Tiamat in a formal way! Just because I\u2019m not completely running amok stealing army trucks and throwing explosives at shit doesn\u2019t make me any less dedicated to glorious chaos! I mean\u2026does it?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s your cue to support the fragile male ego again.\n\n\u201cWell of course it doesn\u2019t my love. Your way is obviously a more intelligent approach to chaos. Just because something is chaotic, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mindless. You\u2019re playing the long game and attempting to build a dynasty. Instead of burning out quick, you\u2019re plotting and planning labyrinthian schemes to eventually burn them all.\u201d You say while looking into Bobby\u2019s eyes and stroking the side of his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you understand me.\u201d Bobby remarks and hugs you tightly.\n\nBobby really does always feel completely better with just a few supportive words from you. Its sort of amazing really since you didn\u2019t realize you had this sort of power over him, then again you two were never really in a situation like this before except the first time you met and that was when you counted on him to \u201crescue you.\u201d That dynamic has clearly changed. You guess this is what his grandmother meant when she spoke to you in the dream.\n\nWith that settled, Bobby and you make your way back to where Helen and Diana are. When you arrive, you see several other family members who finally came out of hiding.\n\n\u201cBobby you\u2019re alive! I\u2019m so glad to see you\u2019re safe!\u201d Helen remarks.\n\nBobby just nods acknowledging Helen, but then turns his attention to everyone as a group.\n\n\u201cHelen, you go check on the kids, if you haven\u2019t already and YOU four, I\u2019m gonna have another long talk with, but we\u2019re going to do that later. Right now, Brandon, Ronald you grab Diana and throw her in one of those cells in the dungeon. There\u2019s a couple of good ones still left. Afterwards, all of you are going to help me clean up this place\u2026shit there is so much to do.\u201d\n\nBobby tells you not to worry about doing anything as you did enough just having to deal with Diana and he wants you to just rest up for tomorrow. You offer to help, but he really won\u2019t hear of it. You don\u2019t press the issue since hey if he doesn\u2019t want you doing any work, you\u2019re not going to argue about that. Before you leave he tells you that he\u2019s got a spare gun in his clothing drawer just in case of an emergency.\n\nBefore you head to your room, you grab a quick meal since you realize you didn\u2019t really eat yesterday. By the time you get to your room, you\u2019re really glad you didn\u2019t have to help Bobby, because you\u2019re really starting to feel the aches and pain all over your body. You take another shower, which helps a little.\n\nYou spend the remainder of the day and night in the bedroom just resting. You hear noise occasionally from downstairs. At one point you hear the sound of vehicles outside and looking out the window you see someone driving the damaged army truck in front of where Aaron crashed through the gate as a temporary barrier you guess.\n\nEventually you hear a knock on the door. You ask who it is and it\u2019s Helen. You tell her to come in.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, I just came in to check on you. Are you feeling okay?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cWell my body hurts all over, but other than that, I\u2019m fine. You?\u201d You ask.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m a little sore too, but nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cHm, so how\u2019s the clean up going?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I suspect that will be going on through the night.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess Bobby won\u2019t be coming to bed tonight then.\u201d You remark.\n\nThen Helen walks towards the bed closer and asks:\n\n\u201cDid\u2026did you want me to get into bed with you? I mean I know it\u2019s not the same but...\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re almost at a loss for words.\n\n\u201cExcuse me? I just meant he won\u2019t be coming to bed, I wasn\u2019t even implying anything sexual, and why are you offering to get into bed with me?! Y\u2019know Helen, you\u2019ve been putting out some strange signals towards me a couple times these past few days and at this point I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re attracted to me\u2026\u201d\n\nHelen\u2019s face turns a little pale and she attempts to turn to run away.\n\n\u201cHelen, stop! I wanna know what\u2019s going on in that head of yours, so come back.\u201d You demand and sit up as Helen slowly walks back over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry Suzy\u2026I just thought\u2026I dunno\u2026you liked me\u2026\u201d Helen says looking down.\n\u201cI do like you, but\u2026wait, so you don\u2019t love Bobby anymore?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI do\u2026but I feel like we\u2019ve been so close these past two days, I think I\u2019m starting to fall for you too. I mean when our lips were touching I felt a closer connection to you than I ever had before.\u201d\n\u201cYou were giving me mouth to mouth resuscitation!\u201d you shout.\n\u201cBut you embraced me in your arms! You even slipped your tongue in my mouth and when you opened your eyes you didn\u2019t even let go immediately\u2026\u201d Helen points out.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 was out of it! I thought you were Bobby!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cBobby kisses like me?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cNo, you tasted sweeter\u2026I mean\u2026fuck\u2026Gah! Look I thought you were Bobby okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026I\u2019m sorry Suzy. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not offended, this is just\u2026weird though. I\u2019m not a lesbian, not to mention I\u2019m going to marry your brother. (Sigh) Look Helen, I\u2019m a little tired to deal with this right now. I think we might have to address this in more detail tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cBut the wedding is tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess that will be one more thing to deal with then, so until then good night. And before you even ask, no I won\u2019t tell Bobby about this. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got enough on his mind.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThank you Suzy.\u201d Helen says and then slowly walks out of your room.\n\nAfter she leaves you rub your face in disbelief of how this day has ended. This whole week has felt so random that you feel like you\u2019re in one of those choose your own adventure books, you can\u2019t even imagine how tomorrow is going to go.\n\nThe only upside is unless this is some really elaborate seduction plot, Helen\u2019s not planning to kill you like you thought she might be.\n\nThen again, who the hell ever knows in this house?\n\nAs you start to fall asleep, you can imagine Grandma Morningstar is going to have a field day with this one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\"And now Suzy, having beaten the chicken soup out of all her other opponents this week, will take this final challenge by herself! Will she be able to do it ladies and gentlemen? Will she be able to impress Misty at last? We\u2019ll find out today! Let\u2019s give our small town girl some encouragement for her task at hand!\u201d\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at\u2026\n\nA huge plate of tacos, fish tacos to be precise. The lack of subtlety is hardly surprising at this point.\n\nYou double face palm before exhaling and looking up.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d you ask in disbelief.\n\u201cThis is the last task Suzy\u2026\u201d the disembodied announcer\u2019s voice whispers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit, the concept of fish tacos is fucking disgusting for one thing and for another\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly Bobby\u2019s grandmother appears as she has been doing in your dreams.\n\n\u201cSee? Told you we should\u2019ve just went with traditional beef. Anyway I think the point was made.\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother cackles and with a wave of her cane, you\u2019re back in that blasted wasteland you were in last time.\n\n\u201cAnd what point would that be? And am I meeting this Misty yet or what?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not meeting Misty yet, and as for the point I think we both know what point that was.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and I\u2019m not a lesbian.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWho said you were? It\u2019s pretty clear you love the cock, but you\u2019re in some serious denial if you\u2019re standing here claiming that you\u2019re not into girls as well. It\u2019s okay, really. There are no lines, we\u2019re all here to enjoy each other\u2019s bodies.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d you protest.\n\u201cOh come on Suzy, you know deep down you\u2019re curious. Some of that three way porn on your computer involves the two girls and a guy configuration. I\u2019d say beyond curious at this point. We both know you find Helen cute because you\u2019re a narcissist at heart and she reminds you of yourself in some ways. Nothing like self love.\u201d\n\u201cWell she does have pretty eyes\u2026 but I\u2019m still not interested. She\u2019s a girl and I just don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d you say.\n\u201cBullshit, are you seriously saying you wouldn\u2019t like to put a strap on and do my grand daughter from behind? Pull her hair and make her say your name and then after you were done fucking her, you\u2019d shove her face in your pussy until she licked it clean and you climaxed in her mouth?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure what\u2019s more disturbing. A dead old lady giving graphic descriptions of how you\u2019d fuck her grand daughter, or the fact that it\u2019s sort of turning you on a bit.\n\nYou\u2019re a little at loss for words.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026hey two girls and one guy isn\u2019t lesbian porn.\u201d You say fumbling with a partial defense.\n\u201cOh? I see. So it\u2019s not gay if it\u2019s a three-way? Well whatever you have to tell yourself I suppose. Still, if you truly feel that way I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be open to\u2026nah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask wondering where she\u2019s going with this.\n\u201cHah! You ARE curious!\u201d Grandma Morningstar cackles.\n\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m just wondering what you were going to drone on about!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then here it is, besides being really into getting blowjobs, Bobby\u2019s also really into girl on girl stuff. Bobby probably wouldn\u2019t turn down the idea of having a second wife which would be Helen in this instance. This wouldn\u2019t have worked before with Diana, because of how much you two hated each other. However, with Helen, I think this would be more workable\u2026\u201d Grandma Morningstar says.\n\u201cWhat? He\u2019s never told me this! He\u2019s never even gave any indication!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell of course he hasn\u2019t, as I told you before he\u2019s a bit too much a gentleman to suggest it and I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s never even felt any romantic feelings towards Helen either. However I know for certain if you approached him with the idea, that he damn sure wouldn\u2019t be against it.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019D be fucking against it!\u201d you say.\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re fine with murdering someone on your wedding day, but you\u2019re against marrying two people. You\u2019re fine with being associated with a bunch of murderers that practice incest, but you\u2019re against having sex with another girl even one you find attractive even if you don\u2019t want to admit it. Interesting set of moral values you\u2019ve got there blondie.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m marrying into YOUR family! Isn\u2019t that a little hypocritical to criticize me when you\u2019ve probably engaged in all manner of illegal and unnatural acts yourself?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. My point is I didn\u2019t really have the same arbitrary limits you place on yourself. I\u2019m just pointing out your odd inconsistencies. I suppose it\u2019s not really your fault. You can\u2019t help the puritanical way you were raised.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re getting a little agitated and getting tired of insane troll logic at this point.\n\n\u201cLook, if all you\u2019re going to do is insult me, I think I\u2019d like to wake up now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou will soon, in any case I\u2019m just trying to help YOU out!\u201d\n\u201cHow is sharing Bobby helping me out?\u201d\n\u201cSheesh, first you still can\u2019t figure out who Misty is, now this? You really are slow on the uptake ain\u2019t ya blondie? You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty.\u201d Bobby\u2019s grandmother asks and then taps you in the forehead with her hand.\n\u201cOw! Stop!\u201d you say and back away.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m just going to end with this sagely wisdom. If you really want to live in a harmonious household, I suggest you open your mind a little. You\u2019ve already made a few steps in the right direction; you might as well go all the way. I mean who the hell is going to be judging you? Nobody important that\u2019s for sure. Besides, I\u2019m sure with a little forethought you can think of the benefits of such an arrangement and turn it into an advantage. Well, that\u2019s what I think. Anyway, congrats on your wedding and you\u2019ve got my blessing. Good luck!\u201d\n\nGood luck? Somehow that doesn\u2019t sound reassuring. You\u2019re about to ask Bobby\u2019s grandmother what she exactly means by that, but then she waves that damn cane again and you\u2019re enveloped the blackness and then you wake up.\n\n\u201cGah, fucking bitch.\u201d You say groggily.\n\u201cOh...I\u2019m sorry for waking you\u2026I just wanted to apologize for yesterday and give you this to see if it fits, but I understand if you don\u2019t want me here\u2026\u201d a familiar female voice remarks.\n\nYou look around the room and see Helen coming in carrying some red clothing.\n\n\u201cHuh? No, not you\u2026wait what are you doing in here anyway? Did Bobby spend all night working on the house?\u201d you ask\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing in your wedding dress and yes, Bobby has been working on the house for the most part. Trying to patch up the big hole in the house, cleaning up the dungeon, blocking the front gate. He had to bury our brother Jordan as well. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s actually slept yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, forgot that that asshole killed one of your siblings. I didn\u2019t know him that well, but sorry for your loss.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cThank you, but I suppose we\u2019re all just puppets in Tiamat\u2019s glourious chaos, so we all need to just move on right? We have to accept that some things just will never be\u2026anyway could you see if this fits?\u201d Helen asks holding up the red clothing which now looks a lot like lingerie.\n\u201cWait, that\u2019s the wedding dress? It looks like slutty underwear from Hot Secret.\u201d You answer and get out of bed.\n\nHelen\u2019s face looks a bit offended by that statement.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother wore this on her wedding day! She had this dress made of the finest silk, not whatever cheap material they use in North Tiwanaland or some place! THIS is a one of a kind article of clothing! It\u2019s not something you\u2019d find in some edgy teenager hang out!\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cOkay! Geez. I\u2019m not trying to insult the dress or your grandmother. It\u2019s just\u2026well I thought I\u2019d be wearing something a little more\u2026 substantial. But seeing as your family isn\u2019t exactly conventional and when in Rome\u2026I guess I better try it on. Um, you washed it right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Hand washed it myself. Can\u2019t risk putting it in a machine.\u201d Helen says and hands it to you.\n\u201cRed fishnets\u2026red high heels\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes. Those shoes were also special made with the finest\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLeather. Yes, I can imagine. Let me guess the fishnets were made with the finest silk as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course, what else would it be?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else indeed. Okay, well I guess I\u2019m going in the bathroom to change.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019m still sorry about making you uncomfortable about my unwanted advances.\u201d Helen says.\n\nBefore you enter the bathroom, you start to wonder\u2026\n\n\u201cHelen, why did you approach me? Or rather I know why, but you were attracted to Bobby long before you met me. You obviously have the inner strength to make the first move as it were.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that was a little different for several reasons. I mean Diana would\u2019ve killed me had I actually made a move on Bobby! With you, I just\u2026I dunno. The moment felt right? And it still wasn\u2019t easy. Of course I misread signals. Sorry.\u201d Helen remarks meekly.\n\nAnd there it is, Helen\u2019s subservience in action. Even with Diana gone, Helen\u2019s mindset hasn\u2019t changed much. You\u2019re just a \u201cnicer\u201d replacement to Diana. You\u2019re fairly certain now that Helen means no harm to you, if indeed she ever really did.\n\nSo this is it, you\u2019ll marry Bobby, have children by him and live happily ever as queen in this twisted family. Helen as usual will play the second fiddle content with her lot in life. As strange as that seems all relatively good for you, you still can\u2019t help but think Helen doesn\u2019t deserve better in some way. She did directly save your life after all.\n\nIt makes you start to ponder Grandma Morningstar\u2019s words of opening one\u2019s mind to make way for new possibilities\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue on your path", "result": "And you silently dismiss that idea immediately!\n\nGrandma Morningstar may or may not have been right about your \u201cflexible\u201d sexuality, but even if she was, you are still not fucking Helen just because you feel sorry for her or on some whim!\n\nBesides, you\u2019re about to marry Bobby and you made a damn commitment. You can\u2019t just be fucking his sister, hours before the wedding. Maybe nobody else in this family has any much sense of \u201csocial mores\u201d but that\u2019s just wrong as far as your concerned. And even if Bobby WAS okay with it, you\u2019re already making enough sacrifices for him and giving in to his possible secret desires for a harem aren\u2019t part of that plan. You\u2019re the only one and that\u2019s that. You don\u2019t fucking share.\n\nYou enter the bathroom and go through your usual routine of showering and such. Afterwards you finally get around putting on the \u201cwedding dress.\u201d\n\nThe first thing you do is look at the dress before putting it on and wondering if it\u2019s going to be bigger in the chest area. While you\u2019re not lacking in that region, you\u2019ve met Bobby\u2019s grandmother (in dream form anyway) and she\u2019s got at least another couple cup sizes on you. In fact her body type back in her prime was more of an old school 1950s pinup girl hourglass figure than your own \u201cpetite\u201d size.\n\nThe funny thing is, as soon as you put it on, it seems to fit perfectly to your own body. The material isn\u2019t any sort of spandex or stretchy material, it\u2019s silk like Helen said, but given Bobby\u2019s family\u2019s strangeness, you have to wonder if it\u2019s\u2026magical?\n\n\u201cMagical underwear.\u201d You scoff; shaking your head in half disbelief you\u2019re even considering it. Not surprisingly the stockings AND the shoes fit you perfectly as well.\n\nYeah, Grandma Morningstar probably had all this stuff weaved by a giant magical spider voodoo priest or some shit because it doesn\u2019t make sense that any of this stuff would fit you so well.\n\nRegardless of its origins, you do feel pretty comfortable despite looking like a Hollywood streetwalker. The heels don\u2019t even hurt your feet, though you\u2019re still a little unsteady on them due to not being used to wearing such things. Let alone these being stilettos.\n\nThe last time you wore heels was when Uncle Ed made you wear stripperiffic clothing with the intent to lure Bobby and his dad into the woods where he could kill them. While everything turned out for the best because you met Bobby that fateful night, the part with Uncle Ed still gives you the shivers just thinking about it.\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror one more time, before leaving the bathroom.\n\n\u201cWell Suzy, you might look like a whore in this thing, but at least you look like a high priced one.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nWhen you exit the bathroom Helen stands up and looks at you.\n\n\u201cOh my. You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re\u2026so beautiful looking. I knew it would fit you perfectly.\u201d Helen gushes.\n\u201cYeah I am pretty hot looking in this get up. Shit, still can\u2019t balance on these heels though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHmm, well maybe you can dispense with those. I mean I\u2019d hate for you to fall down the stairs when we go show everyone how you look. Maybe we should take some pictures!\u201d Helen says approaching you.\n\u201cWhat? I thought I was just putting it on as a test drive as it were. While I won\u2019t deny this stuff feels pretty comfortable on my skin that I don\u2019t mind wearing it, I sort of don\u2019t want to be walking around the house with it on until show time. Besides everyone can see how awesomely sexy I am then.\u201d\n\u201cI think they should see you now. It\u2019ll raise the spirits around here seeing you dressed like this.\u201d Helen remarks as she begins touching your arm.\n\u201cWell it\u2019ll raise something with the males around here when they see me of course. Not sure about the ladies of this house, though you\u2019re getting a little too close there Helen.\u201d\n\u201cOh please? At least go show Bobby. I know he\u2019d like to see you.\u201d Helen says ignoring your previous remark about invading your personal space.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s really busy right now, besides isn\u2019t it bad luck for me to see him right before the wedding?\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re thinking of those silly traditions for other weddings. That\u2019s not the case here. Come on I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d Helen says and at this point is pulling on your hands almost causing you fall.\n\u201cHey! I nearly fell! I told you already that you\u2019re too damn close!\u201d you snap.\n\nHelen immediately backs away and looks down submissively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Suzy. I didn\u2019t mean to violate your personal space.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) It\u2019s fine Helen\u2026just calm down a bit and let me at least take these shoes off first before I go heading downstairs.\u201d\n\nAs you sit down and start taking your shoes off, you and Helen start to hear noise from outside. The both of you go over to the window to take a peek.\n\nYou and Helen see several figures crawling under the truck blocking the broken front gate or trying to climb the fence. The ones that have gotten in are loping in a wild jerky like motion. They\u2019re also screaming, howling and making inhuman sounds. From your vantage point they LOOK human, but they\u2019re certainly not acting like it.\n\nThen the door swings open causing both you and Helen to jump a bit. It\u2019s Veronica with a gun in hand.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you two doing in here, dyking it out? Don\u2019t you know we\u2019re being attacked by zombies?\u201d Veronica exclaims.\n\u201cI was trying on my wedding dress, thank you very much and we only just saw the freaks outside, so they are zombies?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah, I mean\u2026I dunno if they are. Maybe they\u2019re just rabid humans or something, but they\u2019re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready in a moment.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell hurry up or else there isn\u2019t going to be a wedding. We\u2019re having a hard time trying to\u2026\u201d\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n\u201cShit! That sounded close! I gotta go!\u201d Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell at least it looks like Bobby\u2019s finally lit a fire under his relative\u2019s asses to pull their weight around here.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day HAD to get worse\u2026\u201d you say shaking your head.\n\u201cSuzy, we need to hurry to go help Bobby.\u201d Helen says pointing out the obvious.\n\u201cYeah, hold on let me just get something.\u201d\n\nYou go to Bobby\u2019s clothing drawer to get the spare gun he mentioned yesterday.\n\n\u201cHey, what about me?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cWell, just grab a blunt object! Unplug that desk lamp and use that to bash those freaks\u2019 heads in I guess.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, I don\u2019t really want to argue, but do you even know how to use a gun properly? Maybe you should give me the gun and you just stay behind me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not giving you the gun! And for your information my older brother Ben DID show me how to shoot a gun\u2026a few times.\u201d\n\u201cA few times\u2026Suzy, I was taught to fire a gun, aim and everything else before I was ten. I\u2019m just saying in a situation like this, it might be best if I have the gun, I\u2019m sure when we get to the others, Bobby will give you another one of his.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cYeah and in the mean time I\u2019m fucking defenseless.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be! I\u2019ll protect you and I think you can count on that.\u201d Helen says.\n\nHelen\u2019s insistence on wanting the gun is making you even more paranoid in this already fucked up situation. In the back of your mind you can\u2019t help but think she\u2019s going to shoot you even though the pair of you are supposed to be cool with each other. Of course it\u2019s possible she\u2019d just feel safer with the gun in her hand.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually know if she\u2019s a better shot than you, though you aren\u2019t exactly a highly skilled sharp shooter. Especially after failing to hit Diana during your scuffle yesterday.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hand the gun to Helen", "result": "You\u2019re making a big leap in faith here\u2026\n\nYou look at Helen and the gun, then with a deep exhale you slowly hand it to her.\n\nHelen takes the pistol and checks it before addressing you.\n\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me do you?\u201d Helen says looking a little hurt.\n\u201cI gave you the gun didn\u2019t I? Come on let\u2019s go deal with these zombies, or whatever they are before they eat us or something.\u201d\n\u201cUm, aren\u2019t you going to change your clothing?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cHuh? Oh.\u201d You say not even realizing you were still dressed the way you were. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my fucking wedding day, but I will be taking this.\u201d You say and then unplug the small desk lamp you mentioned earlier to Helen and take it as a makeshift weapon.\n\u201cUm, okay then.\u201d Helen remarks and the pair of you are out the door with her taking the lead.\n\nThe pair of you head through the corridor and down the stairs both not making many comments at this point. Might be due to the situation being more than a little tense and its only getting more so as the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are getting louder as you approach the center of the fighting.\n\nAs you approach yet another door, suddenly two of the creatures burst through it. The sight and surprise cause the both of you to scream, but Helen manages to keep her cool long enough to shoot the first creature directly in the head, dropping it immediately.\n\nThe second one however tackles Helen to the floor. She drops her pistol and struggles with the creature while calling for you to help. You don\u2019t even bother scrambling for the gun yourself; you just smash the side of the thing\u2019s head with the lamp you already have in hand, which is enough to cause it roll off of Helen, but not enough to kill it.\n\nWith a massive head wound the thing starts to move again, continuing to make all sorts of horrible guttural noises. Helen however has retaken possession of the gun again and fires two more shots into the thing\u2019s face. It ceases moving and slumps lifelessly to the floor.\n\n\u201cShit, that was intense.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, thanks for getting that thing off me.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cNo problem. Guess it was a good idea handing you the gun afterall. You are a much better shot. I probably would\u2019ve missed and dropped the damn gun as soon as those zombies came running through the door.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know these things aren\u2019t really rotten looking or anything. Maybe they aren\u2019t undead.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cWell I still don\u2019t want to get killed and eaten by some virus infected asshole. Come on, this isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d You say and help Helen up.\n\nBy the time you get to Bobby and the rest of the family\u2019s location, they\u2019ve managed to wipe out most of the things and you and Helen don\u2019t have much to do. Still, you wonder about their origin. Some sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left town and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He\u2019s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he\u2019s about to collapse.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?! They didn\u2019t bite you did they?\u201d Bobby asks, stumbling a bit from exhaustion.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. We both are.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSuzy saved my life.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cWell, I think we both saved each other more than enough times this week.\u201d You say which causes a bit of a happiness of Helen\u2019s face.\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad the both of you are okay. I have to ask though, what\u2019s with your clothing?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cOh yeah, I guess Veronica didn\u2019t tell you, I was trying on the wedding dress when all this shit went down. Speaking of which let\u2019s get this wedding started! I\u2019m anxious to get married!\u201d you say and go up to Bobby giving him a kiss.\n\nNow you\u2019ve caught everyone off guard. One moment they\u2019re fighting for their lives, the next they\u2019re attending a wedding.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cWe just won a great victory and I\u2019m in my wedding dress. What better time than now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I suppose you have a point.\u201d Bobby says with a smile.\n\u201cGood! I\u2019m ready to become part of this family.\u201d You say.\n\nBobby looks around at the rest of his family.\n\n\u201cWell, you heard my soon to be wife! Let\u2019s get this started! Helen go get the kids, Brandon, Ronald, go grab Diana and the rest of you do a quick sweep of the house just to make sure we got all those bastards. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Bobby orders.\n\nEveryone complies and soon you and Bobby are left by yourselves. Bobby takes a seat to briefly rest. He yawns several times in a row and is struggling to stay awake, but you can tell your enthusiasm for the wedding has energized him a bit. You decide to keep the energy going by sitting on his lap and making a fuss.\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not time for the honeymoon yet.\u201d Bobby remarks with a brief chuckle.\n\u201cOh it\u2019s always times for the honeymoon with you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDamn, I wish I wasn\u2019t so tired\u2026hope I don\u2019t stumble over the joining passage when I\u2019m marrying us.\u201d Bobby remarks as he rubs your legs.\n\u201cWait, isn\u2019t someone else doing that?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m doing it. I mean I\u2019m the high priest here. Technically it could just be me and you here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it? We could\u2019ve done that a long time ago!\u201d\n\u201cWell, like I\u2019ve told you before, I just wanted it to be perfect.\u201d\n\nYou wrap your arms around Bobby and lean your body against him.\n\n\u201cBobby, just being with you, is enough perfection for me. Besides, isn\u2019t the carnage surrounding us true perfection in the eyes of Tiamat\u2019s chaotic glory or something?\u201d you ask.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d He says and then pauses. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve been thinking. I\u2019ll take care of Diana personally; you don\u2019t need to worry about her anymore. You don\u2019t need to go through some sacrifice ritual just to prove yourself\u2026I know you love me and that you\u2019re one of us now. No need to dirty your hands on her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet and I\u2019m really glad you feel that way. But I\u2019ll take the knife anyway, I\u2019ve got something special in mind.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Like what?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see.\u201d You say with a smile.\n\nA few more moments pass as you wait for everyone to return. In the meantime you let Bobby rest a bit by closing his eyes. Veronica and Denise return first, then Helen with all the children. Finally Brandon and Ronald arrive gripping Diana by each arm. Predictably she\u2019s swearing up a storm and accusing everyone of being against her.\n\nIt wakes Bobby up from his brief nap.\n\n\u201cOh? Everyone here? Good. Let\u2019s get this started. (Yawn) Sorry, I\u2019m so damn tired\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBobby, you don\u2019t need to stand up for this, just keep resting in your chair and I\u2019ll just be right here on your lap. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s acceptable to everyone right?\u201d you ask.\n\nNobody has any real objections to this, well except Diana of course.\n\n\u201cBobby! You\u2019re making a fucking mistake! I\u2019M your soul mate! I\u2019M the one supposed to marry you! You\u2019re betraying Tiamat and everything we hold dear!\u201d she screams.\n\nIgnoring Diana, Bobby recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you accept your place as his wife.\n\nThen the both of you kiss like you\u2019ve done so many times before, though this time it\u2019s different. Most of Bobby\u2019s family claps if they are able. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n\u201cHere. I\u2019ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.\u201d Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It\u2019s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly. Diana\u2019s eyes would burn through you if they could.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you gave her grandma\u2019s ring?! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! You dishonor that woman! I hope grandma\u2019s spirit comes back and rapes the pair of you with a fucking broom handle!\u201d Diana shouts.\n\nAt this point Bobby calmly pulls out a knife and hands it to you.\n\n\u201cDid you still want the honors?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\nYou take the knife and look over at Helen, who is trying her best to look supportive. Well, you know she IS supportive, but you also know that this isn\u2019t really what she wants. Still, maybe there is a way to make things just a little better for her.\n\n\u201cHelen, you and I have been through a lot this week and in this week I\u2019ve come to see you as the sister I never had. Now that I\u2019m officially part of this family, we ARE sisters. I know this is my day, but I feel like I should at least share some of my fortune with you. So here you go. Time to finally put all those years of bullying to rest.\u201d You say and hand Helen the knife.\n\nHelen is shocked by your gesture. Several other family members are as well. Diana however is still livid.\n\n\u201cOh by Tiamat\u2019s Chaotic Cunt\u2026I\u2019m not believing this\u2026fine. I\u2019ve been a bullying bitch to you, I won\u2019t deny that, is that what you want to hear? But if you REALLY love Bobby as much as I KNOW you do, you\u2019ll take that knife and stab the shit out of that bitch over there before you stab me, because if you don\u2019t you\u2019re just going to play second fiddle to blondie for the rest of your life and NEVER get Bobby. And you\u2019ll just be loser like you alw\u2026UGH!\u201d Diana\u2019s words are interrupted when Helen rushes to her and stabs her in the chest.\n\n\u201cSHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! YOU FUCKING BITCH! YOU WERE ALWAYS IN THE FUCKING WAY! JUST FUCKING DIE! DIE! JUST DIE ALREADY! I FUCKING HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! DIE!\u201d Helen screams alternating between laughing and crying while stabbing Diana. Brandon and Ronald let go of Diana and everyone just watches Helen\u2019s meltdown.\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Helen is on top of her sister\u2019s bloody body and the floor covered in blood.\n\n\u201cI\u2026always\u2026(pant)\u2026why? Why couldn\u2019t you (sob) have\u2026just been nice\u2026(sob) just once? Nice\u2026like\u2026Suzy.\u201d Helen says in a quivering voice and looks at you.\n\nAt this point you get up and walk over to Helen. You even kneel down in the blood next to her. She drops the knife and goes to hug you and completely falls apart in your arms.\n\n\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay Helen\u2026it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over now\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nHelen looks at you and nods silently. While she sniffles and tries to compose herself, you address everyone who are probably starting to form their own ideas about what Diana might\u2019ve been babbling about. Even Bobby is alert again.\n\n\u201cOkay folks, I\u2019m sure we need to clean up around here after this recent attack and I also imagine that Bobby could use some rest, so let\u2019s help him out and get to it!\u201d you say.\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that\u2019s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but Bobby says that might attract attention and doing it tomorrow when everyone is more awake enough to defend this place properly is a better idea.\n\nBroken windows and the front door are barricaded with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. Bobby, who has been practically sleep walking by this point just tells everyone to sleep with a weapon tonight and you can all just roll the dice without a night watch tonight. Nobody argues.\n\nYou help Bobby upstairs and the pair of you collapse on the bed. You won\u2019t be celebrating your honeymoon tonight, but at least you\u2019ll be sleeping together.\n\nYou cuddle up to Bobby who is fast asleep at this point and head into dreamland yourself, fully expecting Grandma Morningstar to fuck with you in some way as usual.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You\u2019ve won! You\u2019ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you\u2019ve also thrived! Ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s give our small town girl some applause and respect for she truly is worthy of it!\u201d\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at\u2026\n\nA broomstick.\n\nIt\u2019s just a plain wooden broomstick, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n\u201cNice. I\u2019m guessing you were listening to Diana\u2019s rant earlier.\u201d You say unemotionally.\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when everything disappears and you\u2019re facing Grandma Morningstar in the blasted wasteland again.\n\n\u201cHey at least it wasn\u2019t a plate of tacos this time. Guess you really are deeply repressed.\u201d Grandma Morningstar says.\n\u201cWhatever. Am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou figure out who it is yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t catch it before. Misty\u2026MISS T\u2026Tiamat.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYay! Your pretty little blonde head finally got it! And no you don\u2019t get to meet her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? After all this build up? Seems pretty anti-climatic.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well besides her being busy, the jury\u2019s still out on you.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026didn\u2019t I win? I\u2019m part of the family now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, technically you won, I suppose, but the lot you\u2019re with are practically just sheep to be lead around by the nose by Bobby so they\u2019ll accept anything he says and Bobby\u2019s in love so of course he\u2019s fine with whatever you do as long as you\u2019re petting his ego and sucking his dick. However, it wasn\u2019t like you killed Diana yourself.\u201d\n\u201cSo? I let Helen do it. I think it was pretty therapeutic for her.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, and do you think Helen is going to be on your side in the long run knowing how she feels about not just Bobby, but you as well? You\u2019re too soft hearted, but marrying her and Bobby might\u2019ve better solved the potential problems you may have with Helen in the future. However you didn\u2019t do that and while you probably appeased her feelings in the short term, I still say problems are going to crop up in the future with her. You don\u2019t think she won\u2019t just snap one day or silently plot against you?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar snorts.\n\n\u201cAnd how can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not, but isn\u2019t that what chaos is all about? The risk on a possible outcome no matter how small? I mean I\u2019m sure the pragmatic thing to do would be to kill Helen, but I don\u2019t really see why I should or need to. In fact a little kindness is already going a long way with her and will most likely do so in the foreseeable future. Besides, this whole week has taught me a little something about myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And what\u2019s that?\u201d Grandma Morningstar asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fucked up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I could\u2019ve told you that.\u201d Grandma Morningstar cackles.\n\u201cNo what I mean is, there is a dark place within me. I know that now. I even feel it sometimes. Why else would I willingly marry a man in a murderous cult? I mean obviously I\u2019ve got some serious mental issues going on in my head that I\u2019ve only managed to not act on and outright block out mainly because I\u2019ve been doing next to nothing in life. Until recently that is. I\u2019ve been realizing that the more fucked up things get around me, the easier it would be for me to just say fuck it too and go full retard on the dark side and the thing is, I\u2019d probably be fairly decent at it. Probably even better than most of the current family here.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar listens intently wondering where you\u2019re going with this.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do that, because I also still have a sense of decency. I see no reason to just go engaging in murder, rape and all the rest of that shit just because I\u2019m\u2026evil? I mean am I evil? I don\u2019t know. Probably to most I would be. Probably to you, I\u2019m not evil enough, but to me I\u2019m just me. And THAT\u2019S all I have to worry about. My own fucking code. So, if I want to show kindness to Helen because a small part of me feels genuine pity for her, then so be it. And by the same token, if I suddenly feel the need to blow her brains out because I feel she\u2019s a risk, well we\u2019ll just have to see what happens in the future.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar leans on her cane and remains silent staring at you, then a creepy smiles spreads across her face.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess we will blondie. I guess we will. I suppose Tiamat\u2019s chaos can be as kind as it can be cruel. Who is to say what is right? Well anyway, see you around blondie, I think you\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou turn your head to the right and see Bobby still with you partially under the blankets. He puts down a book he was reading.\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s about time you got up. You look a little frazzled. Bad dream?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cEh\u2026better than others I\u2019ve had this week. Probably should talk about at some point later, but I\u2019m surprised to see you here. I figured you were going to going to get up early to work on the compound\u2019s defenses.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for practically a day remember? Anyway, I did get up earlier and gave everyone their orders of what I want worked on then I told everyone not to disturb me unless cannibals or more asshole family members are trying to wreck the place. So far haven\u2019t had any trouble. Glad to see I don\u2019t have to hover around them constantly.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\nAs Bobby brings you closer to him by putting his arm around you, and he surprises you with his next words.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026Helen was in love with me huh?\u201d he says.\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026she was. She probably still is.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) Shit. You don\u2019t think this will be a problem do you?\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cWhy would it be? You don\u2019t have the same feelings for her do you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, never thought about her in that way. Didn\u2019t know she felt that way about me until Diana opened her mouth yesterday. Guess it\u2019s sort of obvious in retrospect. I was just more concerned about you though. I don\u2019t want you fearing for plots against your life. I mean I can go talk to her\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ve discussed all this with Helen on more than one occasion this week. We\u2019ve worked it out.\u201d You say.\n\nWhile this reassures Bobby you start to wonder about a few of the things you spoke to his grandmother about.\n\n\u201cBobby?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cAre you disappointed that I didn\u2019t kill Diana?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s brought this on? I told you that didn\u2019t need to kill Diana.\u201d\nYeah, but it seemed so important to you before and it doesn\u2019t have to be just Diana, I mean are you disappointed that I haven\u2019t killed\u2026anyone? I mean before this week went all to hell, I was supposed to sacrifice one of your captives that Aaron blew up.\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s arm squeezes around you a little tighter as if to reassure you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I\u2019ve had a lot of things to think about this week. I had all these grand plans of how this week was going to go and due to unforeseen events some of those plans went to shit. Such is the way of chaos and such is the will of Tiamat. Maybe all of this was her way of showing me that. But getting back to you, I had time to think hard about our relationship and why I fell in love with you in the first place. Your innocence.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cMy virginity?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHa ha! Well that might\u2019ve been part of it, but I was referring more about the fact that well you hadn\u2019t grown up in the same sort of environment I did. That you hadn\u2019t killed anyone.\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying the fact that I hadn\u2019t murdered anyone made you more drawn to me?\u201d\n\u201cYes initially. You have to remember Suzy, as fucked up as YOU think your family were, you were the closest link to normal for me and I guess that was sort of a turn on. Of course in time when our relationship grew into love, I wanted even more to\u2026corrupt you? I guess that might be the right word. I wanted you to be more like me, more like my family.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, like I said a lot of shit happened this week. I tried to make plans that didn\u2019t work out the way I expected which made me realize that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been making so many plans, and then I came to the conclusion that maybe I shouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to change you either. I should just go more with the flow and whatever happens, happens. If you never sacrifice someone in Tiamat\u2019s honor, that\u2019s fine. Hell, if you never even accept her glorious chaos, that\u2019s fine too. I love you for who you are now, that\u2019s good enough for me and always will be.\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s words make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. You might not be that \u201cgood girl\u201d that once hid from the world in basement anymore, but apparently in Bobby\u2019s eyes, you\u2019re still \u201chis good girl.\u201d\n\nYou begin to initiate closer intimacy and then that\u2019s when a flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n\u201cShit what the hell was that?\u201d Bobby asks sitting up and rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t looking directly at that flash though.\u201d You remark rubbing your eyes too.\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026I think I know\u2026\u201d Bobby says and gets up.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn\u2019t a big one, but you\u2019re still a little concerned if you\u2019re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLooks like. (Sigh) Shit.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh we are. I\u2019m not even worried about that, it\u2019s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with you. Now? Well I think you know I\u2019m going to have to go and direct everyone. Oh to hell with it, the apocalypse isn\u2019t going anywhere. Let\u2019s go back to what we were doing.\u201d\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d You agree.\n\nEventually you will have to deal with this new world and whatever its going to throw at you, but for now you and Bobby allow yourselves to enjoy yourselves after this chaotic week.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Calm in the Storm of Chaos\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\n\u201cLook Nergal, I know Emberville is miles away, but ever since those dumb ass rednecks have been aggressively trying to move in on our territory, we can\u2019t trade with them or even New Security anymore in the near future. So get these crates of berries and apples over there as quick as you can and get us some medical supplies.\u201d You say to Nergal having to strain your neck just to look up at him a bit.\n\nNergal is an imposing figure to be sure. He\u2019s the largest member of the family, but he\u2019ll always be your \u201cbaby\u201d as far as you\u2019re concerned.\n\n\u201cBut why do I have to do this? I want to go help Anu and Dad fight those trailer trash fuckers.\u201d Nergal replies.\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue son. Besides, Aiden and Nadia are going with you. I thought you liked hanging out with them.\u201d\n\u201cWell they\u2019re good in a fire fight sure, but\u2026I dunno I always feel like they\u2019re telepathic talking about me inside each others\u2019 heads. They\u2019re always making odd laughter about some private joke that only they know.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s probably because they are, but trust me, you know deep down they\u2019ll come through for you. Right?\u201d you say asking Aiden and Nadia.\n\nThe two twins look at each other.\n\n\u201cOf\u2026\u201d Aiden says.\n\u201ccourse\u2026\u201d Nadia says.\n\u201cAunt Suzy.\u201d They both say in unison with a smile.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten used to a lot of odd things since marrying Bobby, but these two sibling never fail to creep you out to a minor degree. You go back to address Nergal.\n\n\u201cNow get a move on, you know those mutants really like their fruit\u2026oh and DON\u2019T waste any of it on some three legged hooker like before. You remember what happened last time, you had to use up some of the medical supplies just curing yourself of whatever the hell that\u2026 thing was carrying\u2026ugh. You\u2019re lucky your cock didn\u2019t turn green and fall off.\u201d\n\u201cAw mom\u2026\u201d Nergal says looking a bit embarrassed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t aw mom me. You heard what I said. Now get going and be safe son.\u201d You remark and hug him goodbye before the three of them get in the truck.\n\nYou watch the gate open, the truck leave and the gate close again before going to check on your other son who is inside the house.\n\nYou find Enki in his workshop with a stack of books and reading one he took from the library (Unsurprisingly the town library was mostly untouched in the chaos, nobody in town has ever appreciated reading very much even before the bombs). As usual he\u2019s reading something science related, probably in the effort to figure out how to possibly improve something around here...or perhaps he\u2019s just doing it for his own enjoyment.\n\n\u201cAnything interesting son?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh. Didn\u2019t see you there mom. I fixed those guns Dad took from the last raid on those rednecks. I was just catching up on some reading. I was reading about solar power, but I dunno where we\u2019d get the panels. I guess we\u2019re sticking with biofuel in the foreseeable future. In any case I think I need to go search the library again, I\u2019m almost done with the books I took last time.\u201d\n\nYou smile at how he\u2019s always trying to learn new things. He\u2019s always been the smartest of your children. He\u2019s also the quietest and most introspective. He probably takes after you the most, not surprising since he looks the most like you.\n\nYou pat him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t grow up before the bombs. You would\u2019ve really liked the Internet. All that knowledge at the tip of your fingers and you never had to ever leave the house.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve told me before mom. Sounded really useful, wish it was still around.\u201d Enki replies.\n\u201cCertainly occupied a lot of my time, anyway I\u2019ll let you get back to it. Remember to eat something son, I know how you get really involved with your reading and tinkering.\u201d\n\nLeaving Enki to his own devices you decide to go back to your own as well by heading to your room, and that\u2019s when the sounds of various laughter and similar noises coming up from the basement stairs. School must be out.\n\nSeveral little ones pass you by, a few wave or say \u201cHi Aunt Suzy\u201d but most to run off to go play. You don\u2019t even know which ones belong to who anymore, you just know they aren\u2019t yours or Bobby\u2019s and you are definitely glad that it isn\u2019t your responsibility to look after them.\n\n\u201cChildren! Remember if you go outside, to stay within the fence! Don\u2019t try to climb over it! I mean it!\u201d you hear Helen shout.\n\nYou then see Helen slowly walking from the basement stairs. She looks pretty drained but then having to look after the Morningstar youth constantly for years tends to do that to a person.\n\n\u201cYou need some help there Helen? You look a little tired.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cOh, hey there Suzy. I\u2019m fine. They were just a little overly rambunctious today. All excited about tonight\u2019s sacrifice to Tiamat I guess.\u201d Helen replies.\n\u201cOh is it time for one of those again? Didn\u2019t realize. Seems like you\u2019ve been having a lot of them lately.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, we are at war with those trailer parkers. Tends to bring in some more captives than usual.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, true.\u201d You say with a nod.\n\nYou\u2019re about to leave when Helen makes more conversation.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry about them you know. They\u2019re fine.\u201d She says.\n\u201cWho shouldn\u2019t I worry about?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cBobby and Anu.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried. Why would I be Helen?\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026um\u2026well I thought maybe with them leading these raids against the trailer park, your concern would be increased.\u201d Helen starting to stumble over her words.\n\u201cNot particularly, I know they\u2019re both far more skilled than some trailer trash.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026of course. I just know how much you love Bobby and wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to him, and Anu being your first born and all.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, but I\u2019m almost inclined to believe you\u2019re more worried than I am especially given your own feelings towards him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t love Bobby! I mean I do, but not in that way! I mean it\u2019s not like that anymore!\u201d Helen exclaims.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about Bobby. I was talking about Anu.\u201d You say.\n\nHelen begins to look panicked.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I um\u2026\u201d Helen begins to sputter.\n\u201cOh come on Helen, Anu, looks almost exactly like a younger version of Bobby. You probably saw it as a second chance even. I\u2019m not blind Helen, I know you\u2019ve been fucking my son.\u201d\n\nHelen\u2019s eyes begin to tear up and she begins to shake. You ALMOST have an urge to press this a little further, but you just can\u2019t bring yourself to torment poor Helen even if it would be funny to do so.\n\n\u201cHelen, Helen, relax okay? I\u2019m not angry. Stop worrying and calm yourself.\u201d You say and put a hand on her shoulder in an attempt to reassure her.\n\u201cY\u2026you\u2019re not?\u201d Helen responds.\n\u201cWell\u2026that might be the wrong choice of words. I\u2019m not THRILLED by the idea, but I already confronted Anu about this, months ago when I first started to notice it. Wasn\u2019t really a conversation I wanted to have and Anu swore up and down that it was all his idea\u2026though I suspect he wasn\u2019t entirely truthfully about that\u2026\u201d\n\nHelen\u2019s head looks down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I just\u2026I was so lonely\u2026you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like\u2026\u201d Helen meekly says.\n\u201cI know Helen. I know. (Sigh) Look, the only reason why I\u2019m not excessively angry about this is because\u2026well this family isn\u2019t exactly conventional and you\u2019re both consenting adults and Anu\u2019s old enough to make his own decisions.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re okay with it?\u201d\n\u201cEh\u2026let\u2019s just say\u2026that time you brought me back to life in the past? That debt\u2019s finally repaid. Just\u2026just continue to keep it low profile okay?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! We will Suzy\u2026and thank you for understanding.\u201d Helen says and hugs you tightly.\n\u201cMm, well I am the nice one in the family.\u201d You say patting her on the back and slowly withdrawing yourself away.\n\nHelen bids you goodbye with a slightly more upbeat tone and leaves to go see to the children. You just shake your head at how simple it is to make Helen happy. You guess after all these years; you still can\u2019t help but feel sorry for her.\n\nYou may not be a born killer like most in this family, but you\u2019ve definitely proven that even living among incestuous cult killers, a little kindness still goes a long way.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Keep the gun", "result": "When in doubt, always keep the gun.\n\n\u201cHelen, I\u2019m not giving you the gun, just stay behind me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2026you don\u2019t trust me do you?\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cWhat? No, of course do.\u201d\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t, you think I\u2019m going to shoot you!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I just feel safer with the gun in my hand, now let\u2019s go!\u201d you say and start heading out the door.\n\nHelen isn\u2019t letting this go though; she continues to bitch about your decision as you make your way through the corridor and down the stairs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poor liar Suzy and I\u2019m not sure what hurts more, you not trusting me after all we\u2019ve been through or you feeling like you need to lie to me about your true feelings.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, we don\u2019t have time for this!\u201d\n\u201cI saved your life yesterday you know!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful for that, but your current bitching about this situation isn\u2019t exactly putting my mind at ease. You seem a little too eager to want the damn gun.\u201d\n\nWhen you finally finish going down the stairs, the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are louder, but you and Helen are still arguing even as you make your way towards where the fighting is coming from.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you still don\u2019t trust me...\u201d Helen remarks causing you to stop and spin around to address her.\n\u201cENOUGH! Just fucking STOP! At this point no I DON\u2019T trust you! I obviously broke your hopes of having some fucked up three way with Bobby and you\u2019re harboring a grudge about it. Now we can settle our differences later, right now we have to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSUZY LOOK OUT!\u201d Helen suddenly screams in your face.\n\nYou spin back around just in time to see two of the creatures burst through the door in front of you.\n\nYou get off one shot, which goes wild due to being taken by complete surprise and not being used to shooting under pressure. You are tackled to the ground by one of them dropping your gun in the process, while the other goes running for Helen, who you hear screaming and running away.\n\nAs you struggle with the creature on the floor, you briefly look desperately over the gun that you dropped and try to reach for it, but it\u2019s just out your grasp. The thing nearly bites you again and tightens its grip on your arms in an attempt to immobilize you. Even your knees to its groin don\u2019t help.\n\nYou don\u2019t know if this thing is undead or just rabid, but it hardly matters when it soon overpowers you and rips open your throat with its teeth.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Take a new path", "result": "You have to admit you HAVE always been a bit curious, and this probably would be the easiest way to satisfy that curiosity.\n\n\u201cFuck it.\u201d You say to yourself, throw your \u201cwedding dress\u201d aside and you turn around and approach Helen.\n\n\u201cTake off all your clothes.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWha\u2026what?\u201d Helen remarks in surprise.\n\u201cTake off all your clothes. Obviously we got some things to work out before we proceed any further, or more specifically I got some things to work out before I proceed any further. So get your clothes off.\u201d You say and head over to the bed where you start taking off your own.\n\nThis is uncharted territory for you, but strangely as you lie in bed completely naked, you\u2019re not quite as nervous about it as you thought you might be. When Helen finally gets naked, you see she has nice little body on her. Her tits aren\u2019t as big as yours, but nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\nAs mildly anxious as you are, Helen has to be doubly so. She might\u2019ve made the \u201cfirst move\u201d but you\u2019ve definitely taken the lead. Helen\u2019s also a virgin for all intents and purposes. You wonder if that might be making all this a little hotter for you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful.\u201d Helen says walking over to you.\n\u201cYeah\u2026oh you\u2019re not bad yourself. So\u2026you ready to do this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready\u2026um\u2026I\u2019ve never done this before with anyone\u2026how should we start?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cUh, I guess kissing. Even in the movies they usually start like that.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Helen remarks compliantly.\n\nHelen lies next to you and the pair of you begin kissing and caressing each other. It\u2019s definitely different than when you\u2019re with Bobby who tends to be a little rougher. This really isn\u2019t all that bad; in fact the only downside is Helen is doing a lot of talking instead of focusing on the task at hand. It\u2019s not even dirty talk; she keeps asking questions if she\u2019s doing something right. Doesn\u2019t take you long before you start pushing her head down so she can stop talking altogether.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026okay\u2026\u201d Helen remarks as she gets the hint.\n\u201cAnd Helen, I don\u2019t want any more talking. Just focus, understand? Yeah\u2026mmm\u2026just like that\u2026\u201d you say as you feel the magic starting to happen.\n\nYour back starts arching, your toes start curling, you begin to make moans of pleasure and grab the back of Helen\u2019s head. You\u2019re generally in a state of bliss as Helen does her thing. At this moment nothing else exists except your pleasure so you aren\u2019t paying any attention to the noise that is going on outside.\n\nAnd you aren\u2019t paying attention to the door when it opens up\u2026\n\n\u201cUrgh! What the fuck are you two doing?!\u201d Veronica exclaims with a gun in her hand.\n\u201cOh! Um\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Helen stutters as she wipes her mouth and raises her head up and probably looking like a deer in the headlights from Veronica\u2019s perspective.\n\u201cSHIT! Doesn\u2019t anyone fucking knock!? What the hell are you doing in here waving a gun around?\u201d you say and try to cover up as much as you can.\n\n\u201cI was coming to warn you that we\u2019re being fucking attacked by zombies! I didn\u2019t realize I was going to walk in on you two dyking it out! Does Bobby know about this?\u201d Veronica says.\n\u201cNevermind all that, did you just say zombies are attacking us?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, I mean\u2026I dunno if they are. Maybe they\u2019re just rabid humans or something, but they\u2019re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready in a moment.\u201d You say as Veronica shakes her head.\n\u201cWell you two better hurry up, (Sigh) honestly, we\u2019re getting attacked and you two are busy licking\u2026\u201d\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n\u201cShit! That sounded close! I gotta go!\u201d Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell at least it looks like Bobby\u2019s finally lit a fire under his relative\u2019s asses to pull their weight around here.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day couldn\u2019t just be a pleasant one.\u201d You say fumbling with your clothing.\n\u201cI hope we get down there in time to help Bobby.\u201d Helen says getting dressed as well.\n\u201cWe will, hold on let me get something first.\u201d\n\nYou go to Bobby\u2019s clothing drawer to get the spare gun he mentioned yesterday.\n\n\u201cHey, what about me?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cWell, just grab a blunt object! Unplug that desk lamp and use that to bash those freaks\u2019 heads in I guess.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, I don\u2019t really want to argue, but do you even know how to use a gun properly? Maybe you should give me the gun and you just stay behind me.\u201d\n\u201cFor your information my older brother Ben DID show me how to shoot a gun\u2026a few times.\u201d\n\u201cA few times\u2026Suzy, I was taught to fire a gun, aim and everything else before I was ten. I\u2019m just saying in a situation like this, it might be best if I have the gun, I\u2019m sure when we get to the others, Bobby will give you another one of his.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cYeah and in the mean time I\u2019m fucking defenseless.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be! I\u2019ll protect you and I think you can count on that.\u201d Helen says and then follows up by putting her arm around your waist and then sensually kissing you on the lips.\n\nYou ALMOST want to head right back to the bed, but unfortunately you\u2019ve got more important things to deal with.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, you can take the gun, but me and you are definitely going to finish what we started after all this is over.\u201d You say and go unplug the small desk lamp you mentioned earlier to Helen and take it as a makeshift weapon.\n\nThe pair of you head through the corridor and down the stairs both not making many comments at this point. Might be due to the situation being more than a little tense and its only getting more so as the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are getting louder as you approach the center of the fighting.\n\nHelen then suddenly stops and turns to you.\n\n\u201cSuzy?\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI just want you to know that if something goes wrong\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHelen, nothing is going to go wrong, but we need to just focus and get to Bobby.\u201d\n\u201cWell just in case it does, I just want you to know I love\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSHIT HELEN! SHOOT! SHOOT!\u201d you exclaim when you see two creatures bursting through the door in front of you.\n\nHelen spins around and fires, hiting one of them square in the chest twice, but it doesn\u2019t even slow down, it just tackles Helen onto the floor. She drops her pistol and struggles with the creature while calling for you to help and while you\u2019d love to do just that, the second creature is currently trying to make a meal out of you.\n\nYou swing at the creature a couple times, but it moves in such a jerky motion that you don\u2019t land a good hit and cause only a glancing blow to its head. Still it\u2019s enough to give you a bit of a breather while the thing tries to get back up off the floor.\n\nYou spy the gun nearby and wonder if you should go for it or help Helen directly first.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Helen", "result": "With as much strength as you can muster, you swing the lamp upside the head of the creature that is pinning Helen to the floor which is enough to cause it roll off of Helen, but not enough to kill it.\n\nYou soon have problems of your own when the second creature you hit before has completely recovered and tackles you to the floor.\n\nWith the map still in hand, you attempt to swing it from your prone position, but the creature has already dug its fingers deep into that arm and forcibly holds it to prevent you from doing so. You manage to keep it from biting your face off by at least pushing your forearms up across its neck. At this close range, it doesn\u2019t look rotten, just very dirty looking and crazed. Still, undead or not, you don\u2019t want to risk getting bit, let alone killed and eaten.\n\nAs you struggle with the creature on the floor, a shot is fired into the side of the thing\u2019s head and blood splatters on you, the floor and partially on the nearby wall.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you shout and then try to pull yourself out from under the corpse. While you\u2019re doing that, another shot is fired killing the other creature that was previously on top of Helen and recovering from the blow it took to the head from you. She then places two more headshots to both bodies.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re dead, we can\u2019t waste bullets, if there are more of them.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Helen asks touching your bruised arm, which aches.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cThese things aren\u2019t really rotten looking or anything. Maybe they aren\u2019t undead.\u201d Helen says.\n\u201cWell I still don\u2019t want to get killed and eaten by some virus infected asshole. Come on, this isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d You say.\n\nBy the time you get to Bobby and the rest of the family\u2019s location, they\u2019ve managed to wipe out most of the things and you and Helen don\u2019t have much to do. Still, you wonder about their origin. Some sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left town and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He\u2019s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he\u2019s about to collapse.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?! They didn\u2019t bite you did they?\u201d Bobby asks, stumbling a bit from exhaustion.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. We both are.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSuzy saved my life.\u201d Helen remarks.\n\u201cWell, I think we both saved each other more than enough times this week.\u201d You say which causes a bit of a happiness of Helen\u2019s face.\n\u201cCould\u2019ve used your help a lot sooner, if you hadn\u2019t been busy cheating on Bobby.\u201d Veronica snorts.\n\nThis remark causes every family member to stop what they are doing and take notice. Helen, looks more terrified than she did when facing the rabid people. Bobby looks more surprised than anyone. He looks at Veronica and then looks at you. You keep a straight face despite Veronica ratting you out.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about Suzy?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s like this Bobby\u2026\u201d you say and then grab Helen close to you and give her a kiss on the cheek. Helen blushes a bit and tries to remain composed, but she\u2019s a mixture of bashful and fearful.\n\n\u201cBefore all this shit went down, your sister and I were bonding in a way that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll disapprove of. Helen loves you. I love you. Helen likes me and I\u2019ve grown very fond of her and I want ALL of us to get married. Right now.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019ve caught everyone off guard. One moment they\u2019re fighting for their lives, the next they\u2019re attending a wedding. Not mention this new bombshell you\u2019ve dropped.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cWe just won a great victory! What, you don\u2019t want to marry two beautiful women?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, I just\u2026this is a bit surprising. Helen, I never knew you felt this way\u2026why didn\u2019t you tell me? I guess it doesn\u2019t matter, we can discuss this in more detail afterwards, but by Tiamat\u2019s Chaotic Cunt and Twenty Tits YES! I\u2019ll marry the pair of you!\u201d Bobby shouts and then you turn to Helen.\n\n\u201cHelen why don\u2019t you go get your grandmother\u2019s wedding dress and wear it?\u201d You say causing her eyes to light up.\n\u201cYou\u2026you really want me to wear it? Are you sure?!\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. I think you deserve the honors and I think she\u2019d want you to wear it.\u201d\n\u201cOh thank you Suzy!\u201d she says and kisses you on the lips and runs off.\n\nBobby at this point tells Brandon and Ronald to drag Diana out from her cell. Veronica looks slightly disappointed by the lack of drama and is even more disappointed when Bobby tells her to gather the children for the wedding. He then warns everyone to still keep an eye out for anymore of those rabid bastards just in case you didn\u2019t get them all.\n\nEveryone complies and soon you and Bobby are left by yourselves. Bobby takes a seat to briefly rest. He yawns several times in a row and is struggling to stay awake, but you can tell your enthusiasm for the wedding has energized him a bit. You decide to keep the energy going by sitting on his lap and making a fuss.\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not time for the honeymoon yet.\u201d Bobby remarks with a brief chuckle.\n\u201cOh it\u2019s always times for the honeymoon with you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDamn, I wish I wasn\u2019t so tired\u2026hope I don\u2019t stumble over the joining passage when I\u2019m marrying us.\u201d Bobby remarks as he rubs your legs.\n\u201cWait, isn\u2019t someone else doing that?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m doing it. I mean I\u2019m the high priest here. Technically it could just be me and you here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it? We could\u2019ve done that a long time ago!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because obviously Helen would\u2019ve missed out\u2026wow still can\u2019t believe she was in love with me all this time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs it so hard to believe?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I just wasn\u2019t paying attention to her. I mean it makes sense in retrospect given how attentive she\u2019s always been\u2026just don\u2019t know why she never said anything before.\u201d\n\u201cScared of Diana.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense\u2026speaking of not saying anything. Why didn\u2019t YOU tell me you were also into girls, let alone my sister?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\nYou wrap your arms around Bobby and lean your body against him.\n\n\u201cEh\u2026well I sort of went through some odd self discovery lately\u2026I\u2019m not into girls so much as I just like your sister. I can\u2019t quite explain it all properly right now, maybe later. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s been a weird week. Besides isn\u2019t all this spontaneity along with the carnage causing Tiamat\u2019s chaotic glory smile upon us or something?\u201d You say.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nA few more moments pass as you wait for everyone to return. In the meantime you let Bobby rest a bit by closing his eyes. Veronica and Denise return first with all the children. Brandon and Ronald arrive gripping Diana by each arm. Predictably she\u2019s swearing up a storm and accusing everyone of being against her.\n\nIt wakes Bobby up from his brief nap.\n\n\u201cOh? Everyone here? Good. Let\u2019s get this started. (Yawn) Sorry, I\u2019m so damn tired\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHelen\u2019s not here yet. You don\u2019t need to stand up for this, just keep resting in your chair and I\u2019ll just be right here on your lap. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s acceptable to everyone right?\u201d you ask.\n\nBefore anyone can answer you, Helen returns in her grandmother\u2019s wedding dress. Everyone is in awe of how sexy she looks in it. If Bobby needed anymore rousing from his tired state, this has certainly done it. She\u2019s not having any problems walking on the heels either. In fact the only two who aren\u2019t in awe, are you mainly because you were just having sex with her not too long ago and this a pale substitute and Diana who just swears and looks disgusted.\n\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she asks a bit nervously.\n\u201cWell I\u2019d do you right now, if it was just Bobby here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBy Tiamat\u2019s Angry Asshole I\u2019m not fucking believing this! You\u2019re seriously going to marry them both? The traitor and the whore? I guess it would take two to replace me! Your TRUE soul mate!\u201d Diana yells.\n\nIgnoring Diana, Helen sits next to you and Bobby and the three of you hold hands as he recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you both accept your place as his wives.\n\nThen the three of you exchange kisses with each other. Most of Bobby\u2019s family claps if they are able. It\u2019s definitely unusual, but it feels so right. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n\u201cHere. I\u2019ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.\u201d Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It\u2019s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you gave her grandma\u2019s ring?! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! You dishonor that woman! I hope grandma\u2019s spirit comes back and rapes the three of you with a fucking broom handle!\u201d Diana shouts.\n\nBobby ignores Diana and turns to Helen.\n\n\u201cI apologize\u2026I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be blessed with a second bride today. I don\u2019t have another ring. I\u2019ll have to acquire another.\u201d He says to Helen.\n\u201cOh that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just so happy to be married to you at last!\u201d Helen says and squeezes him tightly.\n\nDiana is completely livid.\n\n\u201cOh fuck this! Fuck ALL of this! FUCK Tiamat! FUCK this family! FUCK my treacherous bitch of a sister! FUCK your blonde whore! And most importantly FUCK YOU BOBBY! FUCK YOU, you fucking fickle cheating bastard. Just fucking kill me now so I can leave this fucking shameful spectacle.\n\nAt this point Bobby calmly pulls out a knife.\n\n\u201cWho wants to do the honors?\u201d\n\nYou take the knife and look over at Helen.\n\n\u201cDid you want to be the one?\u201d you ask Helen.\n\u201cCan we do it together?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You answer.\n\nThe pair of you stand and walk over to Diana who has now become silent. You can\u2019t imagine the rage she\u2019s experiencing, but her gaze would burn through you both if it could.\n\nYou raise the knife and then Helen stand behind you and puts one arm around your waist and then one hand on yours that holds the handle so they are like one. You turn your head slightly over your right shoulder to give her a kiss and then together with one single thrust you both jam the knife into Diana\u2019s chest.\n\nThe blade strikes true, puncturing her heart. The hatred still burns in Diana\u2019s eyes as she coughs up blood, wheezing and finally dying. Brandon and Ronald let her body flop to the floor when her life force is gone.\n\nAnd there it is, your first kill.\n\n\u201cWas it good for you?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cOh it was the best.\u201d You say.\n\nAt this point Bobby is completely alert.\n\n\u201cAs hot as all this is and despite this being my wedding day\u2026sadly duty comes first and this house has to be put in order. Who knows if we\u2019re going to get attacked again. Let\u2019s start with the clean up.\u201d Bobby orders.\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that\u2019s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but Bobby says that might attract attention and doing it tomorrow when everyone is more awake enough to defend this place properly is a better idea.\n\nBroken windows and the front door are barricaded with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. Bobby, who has been practically sleep walking by this point just tells everyone to sleep with a weapon tonight and you can all just roll the dice without a night watch tonight. Nobody argues.\n\nYou and Helen help Bobby upstairs and three of you collapse on the bed. You and Helen still have a bit of energy left and you briefly consider celebrating your honeymoon without him, but that doesn\u2019t seem quite right despite the fact that you really wanted to finish what was started in this bedroom.\n\nInstead you cuddle up to Bobby who is fast asleep at this point while Helen snuggles next to you. Feeling very loved, you head into dreamland, not even worrying about how Grandma Morningstar might fuck with you tonight.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You\u2019ve won! You\u2019ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you\u2019ve also thrived!

So am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYou figure out who it is yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t catch it before. Misty\u2026MISS T\u2026Tiamat.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell shit, you\u2019re two for two! Glad to see you\u2019re on a roll and your pretty little blonde head finally got it, but no you don\u2019t get to meet her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? After all this build up? Seems pretty anti-climatic.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well she\u2019s busy. Besides the jury\u2019s still out on you a bit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t I win? I\u2019m part of the family now. I mean I killed a bitch for Tiamat, married a pair of siblings and everything!\u201d you say.\n\u201cSo? You didn\u2019t like Diana to begin with, it wasn\u2019t like were killing some stranger you didn\u2019t have any grudge against. As far as marrying two of my grand children, well that\u2019s certainly unconventional, but hardly very interesting in the scheme of things. Though I suppose given how boring and repressed your basement dwelling years were you probably think you\u2019re a real wild woman.\u201d\n\u201cSo what was the point of all this?!\u201d\n\u201cNone really\u2026well I suppose for my own curiosity I did want to see if Bobby\u2019s blonde beauty was even worthy of being in this family and despite what I just said, the fact that you\u2019ve been speaking with me means you\u2019re probably closer to Tiamat than most of them even are. The lot you\u2019re with are practically sheep to be lead around by the nose by Bobby. And Bobby\u2019s so in love with you he\u2019ll do anything for you. I mean sure you added Helen to the mix, but Bobby is always going to love you more. Helen\u2019s just so thrilled to be there that she\u2019s easily pliable as well. I dare say you probably could get either one of them to do what you want if you really pushed for it\u2026but then you sort of already knew that didn\u2019t you?\u201d Grandma Morningstar says with slight smile.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything for a moment.\n\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t all because I felt sorry for Helen and that she gave good head. Helen being a second wife means she can have that whole mess o\u2019 babies Bobby wants. Let her worry about getting fat, stretch marks and the pain of child birth.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cHeh, interesting approach. So I take it you\u2019re going to be the opinionated sexy fun wife while Helen gets to be the submissive, baby and sandwich making one.\u201d\n\"Pretty much.\u201d\n\u201cWell guess you aren\u2019t quite as mediocre as you appear. That\u2019s good. Well maybe Tiamat doesn\u2019t give a shit, but I like you. In fact if I was still alive and decades younger, I\u2019d bend you over and fuck you in the ass raw with a strap on. Make you say my name while I pulled that pretty golden hair of yours. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun?\u201d Grandma Morningstar says with a creepy leer.\n\u201cUm\u2026no.\u201d you just say backing away.\n\nGrandma Morningstar cackles.\n\n\u201cStill prudish as ever. See ya around blondie, I think you\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\nGrandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou turn your head to the right and see Bobby reading and partially under the blankets. To your left Helen\u2019s face and body is practically on top of your own as she\u2019s still cuddled up next to you and got her arm around you.\n\nWhen you try to move, Helen moves with you.\n\n\u201cHelen, Helen, move your arm, I need to sit up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHuh? But I like holding you.\u201d Helen says still half asleep.\n\u201cOf course you do, but you still need to move.\u201d You say and forcibly move Helen\u2019s arm. She begins to stir a bit now that you\u2019ve disturbed her comfort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you got up. You look a little frazzled. Bad dream?\u201d Bobby asks putting his book away.\n\u201cEh\u2026better than others I\u2019ve had this week. Probably should talk about at some point later, but I\u2019m surprised to see you here. I figured you were going to going to get up early to work on the compound\u2019s defenses.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for practically a day remember? Anyway, I did get up earlier and gave everyone their orders of what I want worked on then I told everyone not to disturb me unless cannibals or more asshole family members are trying to wreck the place. So far haven\u2019t had any trouble. Glad to see I don\u2019t have to hover around them constantly. I\u2019m sort of surprised Helen has been asleep all day, she tends to wake up earlier than I do to see to the young ones.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cI felt I deserved a day off.\u201d Helen remarks starting to become more energetic.\n\nAt this point Bobby brings you closer to him by putting his arm around you. Helen also starts getting gropey again and you\u2019re now the meat in an incest sandwich.\n\n\u201cSo how exactly are we doing this?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cShould we take turns?\u201d Helen asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why with a little bit of maneuvering, we can\u2019t all just get our pleasure simultaneously. Helen, you\u2019re still technically a virgin AND you\u2019ve been practically waiting your whole life to get fucked by Bobby, so why don\u2019t we get that out of the way and then at the same time when he\u2019s doing you from behind, you can finish up where we left off yesterday. We can sort of go from there.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy\u2026oh you\u2019re the best! I just love you so much! You\u2019re so thoughtful!\u201d Helen exclaims squeezing you tightly.\n\u201cHey, okay, okay, you can show your appreciation when your tongue is deep inside me. So, Bobby are you okay with this arrangement?\u201d you say.\n\u201cSure, but at some point during all of this, THIS is going inside you.\u201d Bobby says pointing at his dick for emphasis.\n\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d You say and kiss Bobby.\n\nThe three of you move around to get into your positions. Helen and Bobby briefly make out a bit and exchange a few sweet words to each other before getting to it. You imagine that this has got to be the best day her life. Actually it\u2019s probably Bobby\u2019s as well, but that\u2019s for different reasons.\n\nAs the three of you enjoy each other\u2019s company, a feeling of satisfaction overcomes you. Not sexual satisfaction\u2026well there is that too, but you genuinely feel good about your situation. You have not one, but two people who love you very much. Helen\u2019s a bit \u201cclingy\u201d but you think you can handle that.\n\nAt one time having a three way with a pair of siblings after killing someone would\u2019ve been unthinkable, but then again it didn\u2019t turn out quite so terrible either. While you\u2019re still not quite into all this Tiamat worshipping, you do have a slightly new outlook on life now.\n\nYou briefly wonder if you\u2019re \u201cevil\u201d for not only going along with all this, but also enjoying it to a small degree, but what other options did you really have? You\u2019re making the best of the current situation and you won\u2019t apologize for it. You\u2019re no longer that basement dwelling \u201cgood girl\u201d anymore.\n\nWhile you\u2019re in the middle of riding Bobby\u2019s dick and Helen sucking on one of your tits, that\u2019s when a flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n\u201cShit what the hell was that?\u201d Bobby asks sitting up and rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t looking directly at that flash though. I had my back to the window and that was still fucking bright.\u201d You remark\n\nHelen doesn\u2019t say anything, she\u2019s still just rubbing her eyes, and then Bobby motions you to get off of him.\n\n\u201cWait a minute, I think I know what it was\u2026\u201d Bobby says and gets up off the bed.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you and Helen follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn\u2019t a big one, but you\u2019re still a little concerned if you\u2019re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n\u201cBy Tiamat\u2026\u201d Helen says and squeezes Bobby tightly out of nervousness.\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLooks like. (Sigh) Shit.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh we are. I\u2019m not even worried about that, it\u2019s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with the pair of you. Now? Well I think you know I\u2019m going to have to go and direct everyone.

You\u2019re a wasteland bad ass, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nYou and your son get in the armored car and after a quick wave to one of the Morningstars at the gate you\u2019re soon on your way. You study Enki for a moment just sort of recognizing how much he looks more like you than his father. His personality is certainly more similar to yours as well.\n\nEnki notices you studying him.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he questions.\n\u201cNothing son.\u201d You say and then pausing to think of what to say to try to lighten up the mood.\n\n\u201cSee? This is nice. How often do we get to spend any quality time together like this anymore? You\u2019re always locked in your workshop tinkering with gadgets and reading. It does us both some good to get out once in awhile.\u201d You say.\n\nEnki just gives you a brief look before turning his attention back to the road. He isn\u2019t convinced that leaving the compound is ever a good idea, and you can\u2019t really blame him, but you\u2019re going to reinforce some life lessons in him today. That is one reason why you came on this trip, another is just so you can get away from Helen gushing about being pregnant for the umpteenth time.\n\nYou take a look behind your seat and see the several crates of berries and apples in the storage area.\n\n\u201cThose Emberville mutants sure enjoy their fruit. They\u2019ll trade just about anything for it, even medicine. Then I suppose medicine is probably the last thing they need now so it makes sense.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, well I always feel like some of them are going to dispense with the civility one day and just take all our fruit, along with cooking me up as well.\u201d Enki remarks.\n\u201cNah\u2026well maybe a few of them, but I think for the most part they know a good ongoing deal.\u201d\n\u201cI guess. I just hate having to make this run. I\u2019d rather be working on improving our compound.\u201d\n\u201cWell in a perfect world, you\u2019d be able to just shut yourself away from it and spend all your time reading those books you gather up from the libraries, but if you\u2019re going to really make it, you have to deal with people\u2026and mutants, you know what I mean. A little diplomacy isn\u2019t a bad thing; it can even turn potential enemies into friends. Trust me I know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDiplomacy\u2026 is that what we\u2019re doing with those trailer park people? I heard Dad\u2019s last raid destroyed some of their trailers and killed a lot of them. Not to mention we got all those captives for sacrifice.\u201d\n\u201cWell, sometimes diplomacy fails, which is why you also have to be prepared for war.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised you didn\u2019t have me help dad instead of doing these runs.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d never allow that even though your father really wanted you to start going on raids with him.\u201d\n\nEnki predictably gets a bit insulted by this remark. It\u2019s silly of course because you know it\u2019s more of a male ego thing, the reality is Enki wouldn\u2019t want to go on raids with his dad either.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Enki exclaims.\n\u201cCalm down, I don\u2019t mean it how it sounds. I just mean I\u2019m not having you risking your life on regular shoot outs with a bunch of hostile rednecks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut\u2026driving to miles to a town full of mutants is perfectly safe?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but despite your paranoia, it\u2019s a hell of a lot safer than what your dad and some of your older siblings and cousins are doing. Think about it. Have you actually had any major trouble since you\u2019ve been doing this? Other than a bunch of mutants trying their best to look scary and intimidate you, have you REALLY had any trouble?\u201d\n\u201cWell I had to shoot a few bikers trying to hijack the vehicle once and another time I had to prevent a mutant from stealing a crate of fruit and running off with it.\u201d Enki points out.\n\u201cHm, glad to hear that you\u2019ve been able to handle yourself, but that\u2019s still a far cry from what your dad has been dealing with.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I get it, I\u2019m not dad.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re me and that\u2019s a hell of a lot better. Now shut up and listen because this isn\u2019t something you can learn in a book.\u201d\n\nEnki goes back to watching the road while you talk.\n\n\u201cI never really had a great desire for children, I suppose that was one reason why I suggested the current arrangement I have with your father and your aunt Helen. It\u2019s worked out fairly well I think and I know it makes Helen very happy. She gets to be perpetually pregnant and raise children and for the most part I get to avoid it. Well for awhile anyway, see, your father may have a fondness for Helen, but he\u2019ll never love her like he loves me\u2026I think even Helen might know that, but she\u2019s fine with it. Your father REALLY wanted to have a child with me and eventually after some thought to it, I agreed and here you are.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m only here because you let dad impregnate you instead of aunt Helen?\u201d Enki asks.\n\u201cI told you not to interrupt!\u201d you snap.\n\nYou continue.\n\n\u201cNow of course the general assumption was that I\u2019d probably just let Helen take care of you, but I didn\u2019t do that. I gave birth to you, and I felt you were MY responsibility. You and I may be Morningstars by name, but we both know that we\u2019re not really like the rest of them. Think about all your brothers, sisters and cousins, can you honestly say you feel any connection to any of them? I\u2019m not asking if you like, love or even care for them, but don\u2019t you feel disconnected just a little?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I suppose sometimes I do.\u201d Enki says.\n\u201cAnd that is exactly how I used to feel with my own family a long time ago. I used to hide out from the world as much as possible and I did a good job of it too and then one week\u2026a bunch of shit happened that changed my life forever. Quite frankly if it hadn\u2019t been for your father I\u2019m not sure if I would have even survived it, because I was near totally unprepared when the shit hit the fan.\u201d\n\nEnki looks over at you a bit more interested in what you have to say now. Good.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want YOU to ever be that unprepared. Hence why you have to occasionally deal with the outside world no matter how shitty it is. Had I actually been prepared, maybe I could\u2019ve made some better choices. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think I made the best of a potentially bad situation and I\u2019m happy with your father, and my current life could be a hell of a lot worse, but still sometimes I think: What if?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t Tiamat teach us all that life is chaos and that ultimately our choices don\u2019t really matter anyway?\u201d Enki asks.\n\u201cDo you really believe in all that stuff?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is another example of how you stand out from the rest. You\u2019re intelligent and you\u2019re a potential leader, Enki. You\u2019re not like your siblings\u2026or rather your half siblings. Helen can have as many incest babies as she likes, She can have them in the double digits to match their IQ levels and your father can use them in whatever war he likes. Your life however is much more valuable. You\u2019re MY son and there is only one of you.\u201d\n\nEnki looks at you in not quite disbelief, but something close to it. He knows full well you\u2019ve always had a major hand in directly raising him and teaching him about this harsh new world, but this is probably the first time you\u2019ve come close to expressing a close bond with him. Not in a twisted way like so many of the other Morningstars engage in, but in a normal way.\n\n\u201cI love you son and whether you eventually become head of the family or if you decide to just strike out on your own completely and find your own path doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t get stuck in a rut or allow yourself to feel trapped so you have no options. Ultimately just do what is best for you because that\u2019s all you can do in this world.\u201d You say.\n\nEnki is visibly overcome a bit with emotion. Some eye watering occurs and in true male fashion he turns his head away so you can\u2019t see, which causes you to smile a bit.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry son, you can let your guard down in front of me. Just don\u2019t let those mutants see you like that.\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah, definitely wouldn\u2019t want that to happen. Showing weakness in front of them is probably bad for diplomacy.\u201d Enki chuckles and briefly rubs his eyes.\n\nAs you and your son continue on your way to Emberville, you talk much more and can see Enki is going to be just fine.\n\nMaybe you made some concessions to get where you are and you even had some fun doing it, but at least your son knows that he doesn\u2019t have to compromise and can be a master of his own destiny rather than being a slave to circumstance.\n\nEven Grandma Morningstar would approve of that lesson.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Grab the gun", "result": "You go for the pistol and manage to pick it up. Unfortunately the creature you just beaned in the head has already recovered from its head wound. Much like Helen, you manage to pull the trigger and get a couple shots to its stomach, but it isn\u2019t slowed down and uses all its weight to cause the pair of you to crash to the floor.\n\nYou drop the gun, but you still have the lamp in hand and you attempt to swing it from your prone position, but the creature has already dug its fingers deep into that arm and forcibly holds it to prevent you from doing so. You punch with your other free arm, but your hits to its face do nothing. It just repeats what it has done to your other arm and digs its nails in deeply. With horrible snarling, foam and blood coming from its mouth and more ruthless savagery than you have, the thing soon overpowers you completely and its face meets your own to bite your nose off.

I don\u2019t understand, I thought you loved me.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cI do, but marriage\u2026that\u2019s a really big step\u2026and all my other concerns aside I still don\u2019t feel comfortable living with your sister. I mean maybe it would be different if it were just us and no other ties. I might even feel comfortable starting a family with you with a clean slate as it were.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy\u2026that\u2019s just not possible. First of all I already have a perfectly good home that\u2019s fully stocked with necessities, why the hell would I just abandon it? That would be dumb just from a logical standpoint and just because you don\u2019t want anything to do with your worthless family, I still love mine and I\u2019m not going to just abandon them.\u201d\n\u201cWorthless? Yeah, I don\u2019t think highly of them either, but don\u2019t you dare come in and start claiming superiority! At least my family isn\u2019t a bunch of inbred brainwashed murderers.

Well maybe I am, but what are YOU going to be doing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean what am I going to be doing? I\u2019m going to be with you! Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you\u2019re sitting here asking me to give up EVERYTHING that\u2019s important to my life and I\u2019m asking why should I? I mean yes, I get you don\u2019t like Diana, but I already told you that she isn\u2019t going to be a problem\u2026\u201d Bobby says before you interrupt.\n\u201cAnd excuse me if I\u2019m not completely fucking convinced. She\u2019s your fucking ex, she hates my guts AND you expect me to live under the same roof with her even when we\u2019re fucking married? No, not fucking happening and I\u2019m also not being a goddamn brood sow just waiting around for you to fuck me.\u201d You interject.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see how that\u2019s much different from your life now\u2026\u201d Bobby says dismissively.\n\nYou\u2019re speechless for a second.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI said I don\u2019t see how sitting around waiting for me to fuck you would be that big of a change in your life because you practically do that now. I mean what the hell do YOU do except hide out down here from the rest of the world and then every now and then we meet up to fuck. If we got married, the only difference would be you\u2019d be living in a better home and actually have to do something with your time like maybe look after our kids\u2026but of course you don\u2019t want any because at your core you\u2019re completely self centered and only care about what YOU want. You know, you got a lot more in common with Diana than you realize in that department.\u201d\n\nWith as much power as you can, you slap Bobby across his face. He doesn\u2019t flinch, and it seems he was even expecting it. He just gives you the stone face stare.\n\n\u201cGet the fuck out. Go back to your fucked up religion and sister fucking. We\u2019re through, for good this time.\u201d You say.\n\nBobby doesn\u2019t say anything he just gathers his clothing and gets dressed as fast as possible. He doesn\u2019t look at you the entire time until he starts to walk away.\n\n\u201cI love you Suzy, but I suppose this is easier for the both of us. I hope your life works out.\u201d He says and then turns away.\n\nYou hear his footsteps going up the basement stairs and then eventually you hear the front door slam.\n\nAnd he\u2019s gone. That\u2019s it. Bobby\u2019s out of your life forever and you immediately feel a mixture of sadness and sickness.\n\nYou\u2019re sad of course because despite all the problems you had towards the end of your relationship (And the incredibly shitty thing he said to you which caused the final split anyway), he was your first and you do believe he did love you and you loved him.\n\nYou thought you both had so much in common at one time, but it turned out your differences were greater than you thought and some people just aren\u2019t meant to be together.\n\nYou also feel sick due to the fact that he was potentially your \u201csavior\u201d in getting out of your current predicament with your older sister. Now that he\u2019s gone, you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re going to do. You spend a little time wondering if you should\u2019ve just went along with Bobby\u2019s proposal. Would it have really been all that bad?\n\nIt\u2019s too late now though, you can\u2019t call him now even if you really wanted to\u2026and you do really want to, but you just can\u2019t ignore his own faults in what caused the final straw to be broken in the relationship.\n\nSomewhere in between the crying and moping, you realize that what you\u2019re doing right now isn\u2019t any different from any other day; namely, you\u2019re hiding out from the world in your basement. The only major difference is you happen to be extremely upset right now.\n\nBobby was right about that on some level. You do just sit around down here doing nothing waiting for\u2026what exactly? Maybe you were waiting for Bobby to \u201csave you\u201d somehow, but obviously you didn\u2019t really want that or at least you didn\u2019t want it on the terms he was demanding.\n\nWhat DO you want in life Suzy? What can you do to change your status?\n\nWell, you aren\u2019t sure what you want in life, but you know the only potential way to change your status now is to either get a job or find some new place to live. Seeing as you\u2019re already depressed, you open up your laptop and proceed to engage in the soul-crushing task of looking for a job.\n\nAs day turns to night, you spend hours looking for a job\u2026well actually you spend AN hour looking and the rest of the time being distracted with your depression. The problem is there is just nothing out there for the likes of you unless you want to be stripper at one of the many strip clubs. You sometimes wish you were more like Donna because if you had less hangs up about being slutty, you\u2019d jump at the chance.\n\nHowever, you were cursed with an odd concept of self-respect so no stripping for you. You look into waitressing since it seems like that\u2019s another job that\u2019s always available. You find a few places hiring\u2026at the strip clubs\u2026great.\n\nThe further descent of desperation causes you to look for jobs involving house keeping or janitorial work. You are already dreading the idea of doing such labor, but you still have to look. You find one that\u2019s open\u2026at an adult bookstore. You can only imagine what you\u2019d be primarily cleaning up.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with this town? Isn\u2019t there even a goddamn fast food place in need of a hapless burger flipper?\u201d you cry out in frustration.\n\nYou\u2019re about to give up and resign yourself to being depressed and doing nothing until you fall asleep when you find something that looks slightly more promising.\n\nThere is not one but TWO jobs open at a comic shop, imaginatively called \u201cJake\u2019s Comic Shop\u201d who you assume is the owner. One is moving a bunch of boxes around and the other is working a register. Not exactly the most desirable of jobs, but it beats the idea of dressing in skimpy clothing, getting ogled and possibly groped. (Let alone cleaning up jizz for a living)\n\nAs far as you\u2019re concerned that\u2019s your task for tomorrow. You\u2019re heading over to Jake\u2019s Comic Shop and you\u2019re not leaving until you have employment. You feel slightly positive about this, well not really, but you do at least feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something this dark day.\n\nWith that out of the way, you allow yourself to go back to being depressed over today\u2019s unfortunate event until you set your alarm for tomorrow (Which you never usually do) and eventually fall asleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day...", "result": "TUESDAY\n\n\nYour alarm goes off and you groggily wake up.\n\nWay earlier than you\u2019re used to actually. It\u2019s morning and you haven\u2019t been up this early in a long time. You\u2019re surprised you didn\u2019t just sleep through the alarm considering how emotionally drained you were yesterday. Even now, you still feel tired.\n\nYou\u2019re also still pretty damn depressed. Depression combined with your type of ingrained apathy would normally make for a really bad combination of motivation, but against all odds, you actually get up out of bed to go wash up.\n\nYou spend an extra long time in the shower trying to motivate yourself for the first phase of your goals today which is heading over to Jake\u2019s comic shop and getting a job.\n\nEventually you finish up and head back to your room where you start to get dressed, thinking about one of your other possible goals which is finding a new place to live because if this comic shop thing doesn\u2019t work out, you doubt if you\u2019re going to find anything else you\u2019d be willing to do before the week is over.\n\nAlways one to seek the way of least resistance, you reluctantly call your sister Donna since she did say you could live with her and Julie. You didn\u2019t really want to go live with her and Julie though because you know it\u2019s going to be party central non-stop, but you don\u2019t have many other options.\n\nYou ring up Donna several times and get no answer. You ring up Julie and also get no answer. They\u2019re probably both passed out from whatever they were doing the night before. You give up attempting to contact them today, deciding that you\u2019ll just show up on their doorstep with all your shit if you don\u2019t get this job. It\u2019s not much of a plan, but you do feel slightly better believing you have a safety net. Well you like to THINK you have a safety net anyway.\n\nWith that fear partially quelled, you absent-mindedly check to see if Bobby called\u2026then you stop\u2026\n\n\u201cChrist, that was stupid. Get your head straight Suzy\u2026\u201d you say to yourself, starting to feel bad again. You then remind yourself that you\u2019ll have to break that habit.\n\nYou nearly delete his number entirely, but you can\u2019t quite bring yourself to do it just yet.\n\nPushing through it all, you now move on to your next step of trying to convince your brother Peter to let you borrow his car so you drive over to the comic shop.\n\nYou head upstairs and bang on the door to the garage.\n\n\u201cHey Peter, open up I need a favor!\u201d you shout and after a few seconds the door opens up.\n\u201cWhat the fuck Suzy? Why the hell are you banging on my door like you\u2019re the police?\u201d Peter exclaims peeking his head out the door. He\u2019s probably naked.\n\u201cYeah, sorry to bother you with whatever currently doing at the moment, but I need to borrow your car. I\u2019m trying to get a job.\u201d You say.\n\u201cA job? I thought you were too much of a prude to be a stripper.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, very funny. I\u2019m not going to be a stripper, I\u2019m going to try to get a job at a Jake\u2019s comic shop.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cA comic shop? Doing what? Getting all the virgin nerds excited?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be moving boxes or working a register\u2026look I don\u2019t fucking know exactly, I haven\u2019t gotten the job yet. I just know I NEED to get this fucking job or else Kelly\u2019s gonna throw me out on my ass!\u201d you reply getting increasingly exasperated.\n\u201cAlright, fine. Don\u2019t fucking bite my goddamn head off because you got problems. I\u2019ve got problems of my own. (Sigh) Wait a minute.\u201d\n\nPeter closes the door and then a few seconds later opens it up and then tosses some keys at you.\n\n\u201cHere. Don\u2019t fuck it up, and I fully expect you to put gas in it.\u201d He says and then slams the door shut.\n\nWell that was easier than you expected, but then he probably just wanted you out of the way for whatever client he has coming over.\n\nWith that out of the way, you get in Peter\u2019s car and pull out of the driveway.\n\nA few minutes of driving to your destination and you now learn first hand what Bobby was talking about yesterday. The roads are a mess and the town is in fucking chaos. There are cops everywhere, as well as ambulances and fire trucks racing to their various destinations too. You\u2019re also seeing small groups of people rioting. It\u2019s like the whole town has lost its damn mind and you nearly get into an accident more than a few times. Fortunately Jake\u2019s comic shop isn\u2019t too far away, but given the town\u2019s situation you\u2019re hoping that everything there isn\u2019t going to be as bad as what you\u2019ve been seeing so far.\n\nEventually you do get to the shop and so far the place doesn\u2019t look too bad, though given that you see a police barricade a few blocks up the street, you wonder if that could all change. Pulling into the parking lot, you exit the car and enter the building.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you briefly scan the shop and find it completely empty save for a bearded middle-aged man with a ponytail at a counter staring at you. He couldn\u2019t be more of a stereotype of a \u201ccomic book guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026hello. You lost or something? The beauty salon is down the street\u2026though I believe there was a shooting or something there earlier.\u201d He says.\n\u201cUm, no. I\u2019m here about the job. Are you Jake?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThat\u2019s me. Now what job are you talking about exactly?\u201d Jake asks while looking at you up and down. The guy is already probably thinking several dirty thoughts about you and at this point you\u2019re really hoping this guy doesn\u2019t turn the whole job thing into some stupid line about giving him a blowjob.\n\n\u201cThe job openings I found on the internet for this place. It said you needed someone to move boxes or work the register.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m not even sure why I posted that. In this current economy I can barely afford to hire one employee and lately I\u2019m wondering if I can even do that.\u201d Jake says.\n\u201cShit, does this mean you\u2019re not hiring?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026considering you\u2019re easy on the eyes, I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m NOT hiring. Besides you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s even applied so far. You\u2019d think with all the fanboy nerds that practically live at this place one of them would\u2019ve offered to fucking help me out. (Sigh) Whatever, you got your resume?\u201d\n\u201cResume?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah, when people tend to apply for jobs they usually have one. I mean not that any of the tasks here are brain surgery, but it\u2019s nice to have some basic information.\u201d Jake says.\n\u201cOh. Well I don\u2019t have one.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSeriously? You came in here for a job without a resume?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need one.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026alright can you give me any references then?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t or you won\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t because I don\u2019t have any.\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ\u2026do you have ANY job experience whatsoever?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you even want a fucking job here?\u201d Jake asks getting exasperated.\n\u201cNot really, but I want to run around half naked swinging on a pole getting ogled, slobbered over and groped by horny guys for a living even less, so this place is currently my only option for my desperate situation.\u201d You say.\n\nJake laughs at your comment.\n\n\u201cWell at least your honest, but if you think you\u2019re not going to get ogled and slobbered over by guys here, you\u2019re sadly mistaken. You do realize this is a comic shop right?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, there has to be female customers that come in here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSure, but they don\u2019t look like you and you\u2019ll probably get a couple of them awkwardly hitting on you as well. On the bright side, none of the nerds here are probably going to try to grope you. They\u2019ll be far too shy to try that. No pole swinging either, but feel free to run around half naked. I guarantee something like that would really help out business.\u201d Jake says with a smirk.\n\u201cYeah, not happening.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d be that lucky. Well despite your total lack of skill, I suppose I\u2019ll hire you, I do have to ask one thing first though\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd here it comes; he\u2019s going to ask you to do something sexual and you\u2019ll be heading out the door\u2026\n\n\u201cDo you even read comics?\u201d\n\nWell that was unexpected.\n\n\u201cWell, I used to when I was little, but my older sister Kelly just kept taking them from me and either hitting me with them or tearing them up, so I didn\u2019t see the point anymore.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cJeez, that\u2019s not fucking right. You should\u2019ve kicked her ass.\u201d Jake says.\n\u201cYeah well that wasn\u2019t possible, she\u2019s ten times bigger than me. In fact that\u2019s why I applied to this job, she\u2019s threatening to kick me out of the house.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHmm, sounds like a similar situation that I had with my last assistant. His mom was threatening to kick him out of the house and he begged me to hire him. He was a pathetic little worm addicted to all that anime shit. Really he was a lousy helper, but given that the one I had before him just died in my bathroom, I figured I\u2019d give the fat little anime addict a shot.\u201d\n\u201cWait someone died in the bathroom here?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYeah my retarded assistant strangled himself in my bathroom while jacking off. Spent the damn day cleaning the bathroom because of it.\u201d\n\u201cUh, the other assistant didn\u2019t die in the bathroom too did he?\u201d\n\u201cNah, he ended up marrying his crazy cousin and lives in the trailer park outside of town I think. Dunno what he does now since he never comes in anymore which is a shame since the pervert used to spend a fortune in this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026interesting. So about the job.\u201d You say steering the conversation back on track.\n\u201cYeah, about the job. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll want to be working the register\u2026what is your name anyway blondie?\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, and why are you assuming I want to be working the register?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I doubt a little thing like you really wants to be lugging boxes around, I mean unless you\u2019re trying to tell me you can\u2019t do basic math.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I know how to do basic fucking math!\u201d you snap.\n\u201cOkay, sheesh. Calm down I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything. So you\u2019re working the register\u2026\u201d\n\nJake has still already made the decision for you about what job you\u2019re going to be doing and while lugging boxes around really doesn\u2019t appeal to you, you\u2019re still a little insulted that the option has just been taken away from you.\n\nBesides the sexist implications that you aren\u2019t strong enough to do the other job because you\u2019re female, you get the strong impression that Jake also just wants you at the register so you\u2019ll be more visible to all the horny virgin nerds that come in this place.\n\nAnd the more you\u2019re thinking about the fact that you\u2019ll have to interact with the public in general if you\u2019re working the register you\u2019re finding it about as appealing as lifting a bunch of heavy boxes around.\n\nThen again if you antagonize Jake over this, he might just throw you out of the shop and then you\u2019ll have no job.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stick with the register", "result": "Considering you\u2019d rather just sit on your ass and work the register than lift boxes anyway, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point in engaging in an argument that will lose you this job opportunity. Honestly you\u2019re just lucky that Jake is willing to hire you and isn\u2019t making advances on you (yet).\n\nJake proceeds to show you how to work the register and the credit card machine. After a few trial runs and examples, you think you got it. The funny thing is, nobody has actually come into the comic shop yet.\n\n\u201cSee, not very difficult. So, you think you\u2019re ready to officially take the responsibility of the register?\u201d Jake asks.\n\u201cYeah, I guess, but is it always this empty?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo, not usually. It\u2019s about\u2026what a little after noon now? Yesterday was slow as well, but I\u2019m chalking it up to all the craziness going on in town, which I\u2019m really hoping dies down soon. There is a group of regulars that should be arriving in few moments though. They usually just hang out here all fucking day, but they tend to buy a lot when they actually do decide to part with their money and not drive me up a fucking wall with their banter. However since you\u2019re working the register, you\u2019ll get to put up with them this time.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, can\u2019t wait.\u201d You say and sit at the register unenthusiastically.\n\nJake proceeds to tell you that if you need anything he\u2019ll be in his office catching up on going over his financial books. He also warns you not to steal anything, which seems weird since if you were going to steal something, it\u2019s not like you\u2019d listen to his warning.\n\nWithout many more words Jake disappears into his office and you sit at the register waiting for customers to come in. While you wait you start looking at the various items near the counter and start reading through some of the comics.\n\nAs time passes you continue to hear the sounds of sirens and such in the distance. Through the windows you see a couple of police officers running in the direction where you saw those barricades.\n\nA little more time passes and a short man who looks to be in his mid thirties enters. He\u2019s dressed in casual clothing and just nods at you when he sees you at the register. In an attempt to be a friendly, you smile and wave hi before he goes off to look at comics.\n\nWell either Jake was exaggerating about his customers being sex crazed assholes or this guy isn\u2019t one of the \u201cregulars\u201d he was talking about. You watch him for a moment as he browses and takes various comics off the shelves. He looks like he\u2019s really into comics with as many as he\u2019s taking. Eventually he comes up to the counter with a stack of comic books.\n\n\u201cCan I just sit these here for now? I\u2019m not really done looking yet, but I don\u2019t want to lug around a bunch of comics and possibly dropping them all over the place.\u201d The man asks.\n\u201cOh yeah sure. I guess you really like comics huh?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHeh, I suppose I look a little obsessed. I don\u2019t really come in here that much since normally I tend to buy stuff online, but this is one of those times where I don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting for stuff to arrive in the mail. So I\u2019m loading up now that I\u2019m here. Never seen you here before though.\u201d The man says.\n\u201cI\u2019m new. Just started today actually and you\u2019re sort of my first customer. Nobody else has come in.\u201d you reply.\n\u201cOh. Well, this is sort of an interesting day to start a new job given what\u2019s been going on in town lately. I\u2019m betting that\u2019s why there hasn\u2019t been anyone else in here today.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, tell me about it. I wouldn\u2019t have left the house if I had the choice.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I hear you, I don\u2019t like going out too much myself, but I\u2019ve been getting better about it lately.\u201d\n\u201cSame here and it still sucks, but bills aren\u2019t going to pay themselves.\u201d\n\u201cI sort of got around that by being able to work at home. I used to sell and buy shit on the Internet a lot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, like Ebay or something?\u201d\n\u201cYeah something like that. Buy low, sell high, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could do something like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou can, it\u2019s not really difficult.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I\u2019m not really a wheeler and dealer type. Besides, if I had a job involving a computer, especially one involving self employment, I\u2019d probably just goof off and never get any work accomplished.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the beauty of working at home. You can sort of be as lazy as you want!\u201d The man says with slight grin.\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t think you know exactly how lazy I can be.\u201d You say returning the smile.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be that lazy, you\u2019re working here.\u201d\n\u201cWell like I said, I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t have to be. (Sigh) Events however have conspired against me and here I am.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, always sucks when things out of your control put you in a bad situation. For what it\u2019s worth, sorry you\u2019re in such a bind.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t expect sympathy for your minor \u201cpity party\u201d but you\u2019ll definitely accept it. You usually aren\u2019t one to hold long conversations with random strangers, but then it\u2019s been a bit of an unusual week for you.\n\n\u201cThanks, so selling and buying shit on the Internet works for you huh? I suppose maybe I could do it. There\u2019s certainly already enough crap around the house that surely someone would be interested in. Obviously with as many comics as you intend on buying you\u2019re making a good living at it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I probably would be if I wasn\u2019t a bit of a hoarder and kept most of the shit I did buy. However, I made enough that I pulled my weight so my mom didn\u2019t kick me out of the basement of the house. Yeah, I know I\u2019m a walking stereotype, basement dweller in a comic shop. Big surprise right?\u201d the man remarks.\n\nYou don\u2019t reply immediately, you just briefly think about how odd it is you\u2019ve got so much in common with a complete stranger.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I dunno. I don\u2019t tend to judge people.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a rare trait these days. Though I suppose I\u2019m more of a hermit than a basement dweller nowadays anyway. My mother died a few years ago and I\u2019m not even going to be living here anymore soon. Hence another reason why I\u2019m loading up on books now.\u201d\n\u201cSo wait you\u2019re moving out of town?\u201d you say a bit surprised.\n\u201cYeah\u2026I guess you could say that. I mean under normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t bother, but it\u2019s getting really bad out there and it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d\n\u201cWorse? How do you know? You don\u2019t think things will get back to normal in a few days?\u201d\n\nThe man starts like he\u2019s about to say more, but stops. Then he stumbles over some words a bit before continuing.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026well these things\u2026you never can tell right? I guess I don\u2019t really know. I think I\u2019m just rambling at this point and not making any sense. I didn\u2019t mean to talk your ear off. I guess I should get back to it and let you get back to doing your job.\u201d The man says and then briskly walks to the back of the comic shop.\n\nYou nearly tell him to come back to talk to clarify what he meant and that he wasn\u2019t really bothering you, but then you think that would be a bit strange and also you don\u2019t really know this guy.\n\nHe\u2019s probably a weirdo anyway; he just said he lived in his mom\u2019s basement until she died after all. You don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re even still thinking about it or him.\n\n\u201cChrist Suzy, you\u2019re taking the break up harder than you thought. You\u2019re starting to latch on to minor conversations with complete fucking strangers. Get a grip already.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nA sudden brick through one of the shop windows breaks up your introspective moment.\n\nYou duck down behind the counter and then Jake comes out running out of his office.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on out here?!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! Someone just threw a brick through\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore you can complete that sentence you hear a bunch of laughter and the shop door opening up. You continue to stay hidden behind the counter.\n\n\u201cDid you see that shit? Told ya I could land the brick right in the middle of the O on the window!\u201d a young male voice exclaims.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s just see what we got in here\u2026\u201d another remarks.\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you little shits think you\u2019re doing? You just broke my fucking window! I hope you fuckers got some money to pay for that RIGHT NOW or else I\u2019m going to be kicking all of your asses THEN I\u2019m going to your parents\u2019 houses and kicking their asses for not aborting you.\u201d Jake exclaims.\n\u201cOh fuck off Jake, with as much as you\u2019ve ripped us off by overcharging, I\u2019d say that more than covers the cost of your goddamn window. We\u2019re going to be taking some free comics too.\u201d You hear a voice shout back.\n\u201cLook, I dunno what the fuck has compelled you social rejects even THINK you can get away with this, but if you don\u2019t fucking get out of my shop right fucking now, there are going to be consequences you aren\u2019t going to walk away from.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, so fucking scared Jake.\u201d You hear one say who from the sound of the voice sounds like he\u2019s getting closer.\n\u201cHEY! Step back from the counter!\u201d\n\nYou hear someone hit the counter and then you look up to see a pimply teenager staring over at you.\n\n\u201cHoly shit guys! Jake\u2019s got a fucking bitch hiding over here! She looks hot too, no wonder he\u2019s fucking pissed! She was probably blowing him before we came in!\u201d he exclaims and then tries to grab your hair at which point you slap his hand away and stand up and away from the counter so you can\u2019t be molested.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point you finally see the motley lot. Four teenage boys of all varying shapes and sizes. You don\u2019t know who these guys are, but if they\u2019re the \u201cregulars\u201d Jake mentioned, they\u2019re certainly not acting like what you expected.\n\n\u201cGoddamn Jake how the hell you manage to pull this off? She looks way too fucking hot for you. She a whore or something?\u201d The tallest boy asks.\n\u201cHey, you know who she looks like? She looks like that cute zombie chick.\u201d The fattest one says.\n\u201cNah, she looks more like that chick who controls all the dragons.\u201d The pimply one remarks.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake she\u2019s blonde not a goddamn albino, she doesn\u2019t look like either of them, the pair of you are idiots. She obviously looks like the blonde chick that fucks vampires.\u201d The tallest one remarks.\n\u201cWhich one, Trent?\u201d the fat one asks.\n\u201cThe one that\u2019s mainly killing them too.\u201d Trent says.\n\u201cI dunno guys, I thought she looked like that chick that was a private investigator\u2026\u201d another one begins to say before Jake interrupts their temporary distraction of comparing you to various female nerd culture figures.\n\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY SHOP! I\u2019M NOT WARNING YOU AGAIN!\u201d Jake shouts.\n\nAt which point Trent pulls a pistol out of his hoodie pocket. He doesn\u2019t actually point it at Jake, but he\u2019s definitely warning him by just showing it. Jake steps back a bit, but doesn\u2019t lose his cool. You on the other hand are really worried, especially considering you got four hormone addled teenage guys staring at you.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling YOU we\u2019re not fucking leaving without getting our comics! Don\u2019t you know what today is? It\u2019s fucking free comic book day Jake!\u201d\n\u201cThis is how you want to play this Trent?\u201d Jake asks.\n\nNow Trent points the pistol at Jake and gives a look of less playfulness and more deadly seriousness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking playing Jake, just like I wasn\u2019t fucking playing with my mom when she told me to clean my room two days ago, just like I wasn\u2019t playing with those assholes yesterday that used to give me wedgies back in sixth grade or that bitch who wouldn\u2019t go out with me even though I did a whole bunch of nice shit for her. Things are changing around this town and if you ain\u2019t changing with it, you\u2019re gonna get rolled over.\u201d\n\nTrent looks over at his fellows and waves as if he\u2019s telling them to take whatever they want. He continues to point the gun at Jake though he keeps an eye on you as well.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a little busy worrying about Trent and the rest, you realize you haven\u2019t seen that guy you were talking to before. You can\u2019t imagine he managed to slip out without anyone noticing. He might be hiding, but if he is, he\u2019s doing a really good job, because with the way Trent\u2019s pals are going through the store, it seems like they would have stumbled upon him by now.\n\nWhile they do that, Trent gets closer to Jake still holding the gun to him.\n\n\u201cSo what is the story with the blonde bitch anyway Jake? I know she can\u2019t be your girlfriend. A fat old loser like you wouldn\u2019t have one.\u201d Trent sneers, but Jake is still keeping composure.\n\n\u201cI hired her to work the register today.\u201d Jake remarks.\n\u201cHm. I\u2019d rather see her mouth work my dick.\u201d Trent says looking you up and down. Jake starts laughing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so fucking funny?\u201d\n\u201cYOU! You\u2019re fucking funny Trent. You\u2019re calling me a loser and apparently you can\u2019t even GET a woman without holding her at gunpoint. Pfft. I don\u2019t give a shit what little emo angsty shooting spree trip you\u2019re on, but I\u2019m not playing. I still remember when you were in here as a little kid and your ugly ass mama beat the hell out of you for shitting your pants. How you cried and cried.\u201d Jake chuckles.\n\nTrent of course is not amused and points the gun closer to Jake.\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up fat ass!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cMake me lanky bitch!\u201d Jake says and suddenly grabs Trent\u2019s hand now that it\u2019s close enough. The pair of them struggle with the weapon and Trent begins calling for his fellows to help.\n\nWhile you\u2019re certainly close enough to help Jake before Trent\u2019s buddies get to him, you see the front door and wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just jump over the counter and get the hell out of here.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run for the front door", "result": "It\u2019s not exactly the bravest thing to do, but then your own life is at risk and if there is a chance at getting out of this mess now then you\u2019re going to take it.\n\nYou jump over the counter and rush towards the door; two of Trent\u2019s friends try to intercept you until Trent demands that they help him and forget about you. His third friend however ignores him and continues after you.\n\nYou manage to make it half way out the door before pimple boy grabs your arm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere blondie, except on my dick!\u201d pimple boy shouts and follows that up with a really creepy annoying giggle.\n\nYou pull away and get out of the store, but he\u2019s a persistent bastard and manages to grab you around the waist from behind.\n\n\u201cCome on baby, I like an older woman like you!\u201d he exclaims in his attempt to grope your breasts while dry humping you.\n\u201cOlder woman like me? Motherfucker\u2026\u201d you exclaim and elbow the scrawny fucker in the face. It gets him off of you and then you spin around to give him a swift kick to the balls. Twice.\n\nHe falls to the ground crying and holding his crotch. He tries to mumble some curses at you, but it\u2019s hard to do in between the tears. As much as you want to get out of here, you\u2019re so pissed you kick him in his acne-ridden face for good measure, before running off. Just in time too, since you hear two gunshots coming from the store.\n\nYou turn the corner to the parking lot and rush to your car to open the door, then suddenly hear footsteps closing in quickly behind you.\n\n\u201cGimme that car bitch! I gotta get the fuck outta here!\u201d you hear a voice shout. You don\u2019t even turn your head since you already can tell it\u2019s the voice of one of the teenagers from the store.\n\nYou get in the car and start it up. You pull out and are already in the process of driving off until the same teenager gets in front of the car and throws a brick at your driver window\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d you shout before the brick smashes through the window and hits you in the side of the head.\n\nYou lose complete control of the car and promptly crash into a nearby telephone pole. Thanks to shitty air bags not working properly you hit your already injured head against the driver\u2019s wheel. Somehow you\u2019re still conscious, but you\u2019re incredibly dazed and woozy. You\u2019re also not exactly feeling like moving too far, however your feelings are not in consideration here.\n\n\u201cGet outta the car bitch!\u201d the teen who threw the brick exclaims and opens the door to get you out of it.\n\nHe starts to drag you out and despite your less than stellar state you still make an effort to fight. Eventually with some effort he drags you out and then you fell a kick to your ribs while on the street pavement.\n\nBleeding, bruised, and dizzy you attempt to get up, only to not quite make it. Just when it looks like the teen is going to land another kick to you, a shot rings out and the teen falls to the ground nearly on top of you.\n\n\u201cARGH! SHIT! FUCK! I CAN\u2019T FEEL MY LEGS! NO!\u201d the teen screams.\n\nYou crawl away from the teen and through your blurry vision you see a figure coming towards you. It\u2019s the stranger from the comic shop. The fact that he has a pistol in hand isn\u2019t exactly encouraging despite the fact that he just shot your assailant.\n\n\u201cYou alright? You okay?\u201d he asks running over to you.\n\u201cYeah, I just\u2026I need some\u2026help up\u2026\u201d you remark.\n\nUsing him and the car as leverage you manage to get back on your feet. The teen is still screaming at you and the strange from his prone position.\n\n\u201cCan you stand on your own?\u201d the stranger asks.\n\u201cYeah, I think\u2026\u201d you reply.\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d The stranger says and then kicks the teen in the face a couple times shutting him up.\n\n\u201cLast thing we need is that dickhead bringing the attention of the cops that are a few blocks up.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, the gunshots might have already done that or maybe they don\u2019t give a shit just like everyone else in this town\u2026fuck\u2026\u201d you say holding the side of your head.\n\u201cYou might be right, but we need to get out of the area I think, it doesn\u2019t look like your car is going too far, my car is still in the parking lot. I can take you to get that head injury looked at.\u201d\n\nBetween everything that\u2019s happened, you\u2019re not exactly thinking straight or at all except about the pain you\u2019re in.\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah. Whatever, let\u2019s go.\u201d You remark feeling wobbly.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you along the way. My name is Jack by the way.\u201d The stranger says.\n\u201cSuzy.\u201d You say.\n\nJack helps you back to the parking lot as quick as you\u2019re able to move. You don\u2019t see any signs of the cops coming, though you\u2019re hearing other gunshots in the distance so maybe bigger things are happening elsewhere.\n\nEventually you get back to the lot and approach a small blue car.\n\n\u201cOkay, let me open the door and you can just lay in the backseat.\u201d\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d you say and lean against the car, while he opens up the driver\u2019s door and then unlocks the door to the backseat.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026where were you? You\u2026you kill those guys?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHiding within a small back niche where all the old comics were, in the hope of ambushing one of them. I might have done so, had your boss not riled them up enough to rush him. I came out and you were already gone. I smashed the fat one in the back of the head with a metal comic character statue. After he went down I tried to help the owner. He got shot before I could grab the gun from the tall one and then it was reflex response that I shot him.\u201d Jack replies.\n\nJack opens the back door for you and you get in and lay down while Jack closes the door and then gets in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cThat one I know is dead since I shot him right in the head. I was sort of in shock for a moment since I\u2019ve never killed another person before. The other teen had already run by the time I snapped out of it. I came out and I saw what was going on with you and I just reacted again. I dunno if I killed the others. I mean maybe I just knocked the fat one out and the other one when I kicked him in the face. Although I guess I paralyzed him for sure.\u201d Jack says.\n\nJack pulls out of the parking lot and your lids are starting to get heavy.\n\n\u201cYou kill pimple boy? I left that asshole in a heap outside the shop.\u201d You ask.\n\u201cUm, no. I didn\u2019t see him when I came out. Guess he ran off?\u201d Jack answers.\n\u201cWish I\u2019d killed him. Little fucker\u2026ah, shit\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll help like I said so just hang in there okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026okay\u2026\u201d you start to say.\n\nWithin the next five minutes all you hear is Jack swearing and making exclamations of how everyone is driving like an asshole or acting crazy. You can feel the car swerving back and forth when you guess that Jack must be avoiding various things on the wrong.\n\nAt some point as you\u2019re drifting in and out of consciousness. You hear Jack swear some more about how he can\u2019t get to the hospital because the entire area is barricaded and part of the hospital is even on fire.\n\n\u201cFuck! Suzy! You still with me?!\u201d he asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah\u2026\u201d you answer groggily.\n\u201cI can\u2019t take you to the hospital, but I can still get you help. You trust me?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not really in any condition to not trust you I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a serial killer or anything I swear.\u201d Jack says.\n\nYou start chuckling at that proclamation. For one thing his name is Jack, which is a bit on the nose for a serial killer. For another if this guy actually did turn out to be one; it pretty much would be in line of your run of luck lately. Hell, if you\u2019re REALLY lucky, he\u2019ll probably be your next boyfriend because you\u2019re certainly fucked up enough to fall for someone like that.\n\n\u201cBet you say that to all the girls.\u201d You say while still chuckling.\n\u201cIs there any way I can convince you? I mean\u2026if you don\u2019t trust me, I understand. I suppose I could try to take you home if you told me how to get there, but given how fucked up this town is getting, I\u2019m not sure if\u2026\u201d Jack start to say until you interrupt him.\n\n\u201cJack\u2026 just take me to wherever it is you\u2019re going to take me. I truly don\u2019t care at this point because I don\u2019t even really have a home to go back to now. I\u2019ve been having a shitty week, I just lost the only job I ever had, I got groped by some fucking asshole, my fucking head is bleeding, I think I got glass embedded in my face, my body aches, and I\u2019m this close to just falling unconscious. So like I said, if you got anything sinister in mind for me, I\u2019m not exactly in any position to stop you. Just drive.\u201d You say as the sleep is starting to take you.\n\nJack doesn\u2019t say anything and just begins reversing the car and swinging it around. You hear something hit the back windshield, not enough to break it though. Sirens and the general sounds of chaos can be heard throughout the drive.\n\nYou have no idea where Jack is going to take you or even if he\u2019s going to make it wherever he has in mind. All that encompasses your mind is the slumber that eventually wins you over.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and find yourself on a small bed in a gray concrete room. There isn\u2019t much else in the room except a dresser and a lamp which is currently turned on. It almost feels like a cell except there is no door, just an entryway, which looks like it leads into a corridor.\n\nYou sit up and find that you\u2019re still fully clothed, so either Jack isn\u2019t a serial killing rapist or he was enough of a gentleman to put your clothes back on exactly right after he was done and is now playing mind games with you. Your girl parts and ass don\u2019t feel sore and you don\u2019t have a bad taste in your mouth so you\u2019re guessing that you weren\u2019t violated in any way. (You hope)\n\nHowever the rest of your body certainly still aches from the kicks and physical abuse you took yesterday, but when you go to touch your head, you don\u2019t feel any bandages like you were expecting. In fact, you aren\u2019t even feeling any open wound that you\u2019re sure that you probably had. The side of your face doesn\u2019t feel to be scratched up either. Is Jack some sort of doctor?\n\nYou check your phone which was still in your pocket to see if anyone tried to call you, but nobody has. You thought maybe Peter would have at least tried calling considering you had his car last. If you ever get back home, you can only imagine how pissed he\u2019s going to be when he finds out what happened to it.\n\nYou sit in the bed for a while just wondering what exactly is going on and what you should do next. Honestly, you\u2019re drawing a blank. You had a plan, you tried to follow it and you thought you were succeeding and then it all went to shit yesterday. You\u2019re starting wonder if you\u2019re jinxed.\n\nWhile you could spend your whole time being introspective like you have so many times before, the fact remains that you don\u2019t know where the hell you are and where your \u201cwhite knight\u201d is. Jack seems like an okay guy, but you really don\u2019t know anything about him except that he\u2019s helped you out quite a bit which would probably make the average person feel grateful, instead it makes you a bit suspicious and this prison like interior isn\u2019t exactly helping.\n\nStill, you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re being held captive either, so you take the opportunity to get up and leave your room.\n\nWhen you enter the corridor you see several other open entryways leading to more small rooms. Since the left part of the corridor looks like it ends at a solid wall, you go right. You peer into a few of these rooms as you pass by to find that they aren\u2019t really furnished, but rather hold several boxes and containers. Some of them do contain furniture; none of it is arranged in a useable way. In general everything is stacked or positioned to resemble a warehouse more than anything else.\n\nMaybe you are in some sort of warehouse, because so far the color of every walls you\u2019ve seen is gray and they\u2019re concrete along with the floor and ceiling. Lights embedded in the ceiling provide illumination, but this whole place doesn\u2019t seem like a normal house of any kind, which you assumed Jack lived in, you guess not though.\n\nYou pass a set of stairs leading up, so you\u2019re guessing you\u2019re on the ground floor, the way you\u2019re currently heading it looks like a large open room ahead.\n\nAs you approach the large room, you start to hear noise. Sounds like it\u2019s coming from one the rooms ahead and to your right causing you to cautiously approach.\n\nYou peek around the corner and see Jack occupied and messing about with some sort of large radio system along with a few monitors set up. You hear garbled transmissions, but some of it you\u2019re making out sounds military related, something about marshal law.\n\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t need to spy on me, you\u2019re welcome to come in.\u201d Jack says without immediately looking in your direction. Apparently you\u2019re not as stealthy as you thought and Jack is very aware of his surroundings.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to spy, just wasn\u2019t sure who or what I\u2019d be possibly bumping into after finding myself in a strange place.\u201d You say standing in the entryway.\n\u201cUnderstandable. So I trust you\u2019re doing okay?\u201d Jack asks while still messing about with his radio.\n\u201cYeah, I mean I still ache a bit, but I\u2019m more or less fine. Hey you\u2019re not medically trained are you? Because I thought I\u2019d have some bandages or something what with getting smacked with a brick and glass shattering on the side on my head.\u201d\n\u201cNot professionally, but I used some medical gel on your wounds. Glad to see it worked well.\u201d Jack says finally turning to look at you.\n\u201cWorked well? I\u2019m practically fully healed, is it magical or something?\u201d you joke.\n\u201cNo, just highly advanced\u2026um\u2026well if you really need to know, I shouldn\u2019t even have the stuff, but you can acquire a lot of stuff you shouldn\u2019t over the deep web.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI see. So I take it, this is where you live?\n\u201cYeah, more or less now.\u201d\n\u201cWait, so this is where your mom lived too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh no. When I lived with mom, it was a regular house in town. In fact after she died, I still lived there, but when shit started getting hectic in town, I decided I better move somewhere less vulnerable so here I am at this gray building I bought years ago online. As you might have already seen, I got tons of shit stacked in rooms, told you I was a big of a hoarder.\u201d\n\u201cWell it certainly is very gray, must cost a lot to upkeep it.\u201d\n\u201cNot really, place sort of takes care of itself. Just never made a permanent living arrangement out of this place because\u2026well it\u2019s a long story.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a pause in the conversation since Jack just abruptly stops talking and starts twisting knobs and then eventually waves his hands at the radio altogether and the garbled transmissions stop altogether when he turns it off.\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to listen in on a military frequency. Normally I can get clear messages from Fort Timons near Security City, but I\u2019m not having much luck. All I know is marshal law has been declared in major cities across the country. Well that and apparently Ground Zero is still offering their shelters at low low prices. Those ads are fucking everywhere.\u201d Jack replies.\n\u201cMarshall law\u2026that sounds pretty serious.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised with the way things have been going in the world lately. Anyway\u2026so what are your plans?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cI dunno. I\u2019ve been trying to figure that out myself. I\u2019m not having much luck either.\u201d\n\u201cWell, considering how fucked up things are in town, you\u2019re welcome to stay here. Got plenty of space, food and such.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tempting offer. Really tempting, mainly because you don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re going to go, but you exhale and try to gather your thoughts.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Look, I\u2019m not ungrateful for probably saving my life yesterday. I didn\u2019t mind speaking with you before all that shit went down in the comic shop. Hell, you\u2019re even not bad looking and you\u2019re obviously got your shit together enough that you own your own damn building. I\u2019m also fairly certain you were telling the truth about not being a serial killer.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d Jack says predicting your lead in.\n\n\u201cBut all of this\u2026well my gut is telling me that something weird is going on with you. I don\u2019t know what exactly, but I imagine it\u2019s complicated. The funny thing is that it probably wouldn\u2019t even necessarily bother me, but you sort of caught me at an unusual point in my life. While I don\u2019t want to bore you with my life story, but I just recently went through an upsetting break up with my first and currently only boyfriend to date a couple days ago and I\u2019m still trying to mentally deal with that along with all the other shit that\u2019s gone on in my life.\u201d\n\nJack continues to listen as you go on.\n\n\u201cYou think YOU were a basement dweller? At least you seemed to be doing something productive, my whole life was just coasting by and living off of other people and the most recent one was my ex. I\u2019m fairly certain he would have done anything to take care of me had I complied, but even basement dwellers have their limits I suppose and I just couldn\u2019t make that step. All of which left me up shit\u2019s creek without a boat, let along a paddle. I\u2019m trying to make a real effort of being self-sufficient and I sort of feel like if I stayed here I\u2019d just be falling back into my old routine of sponging off some guy.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t exactly be sponging off me\u2026\u201d Jack starts to say before you interrupt.\n\u201cJack, I think you better stop right there, if you\u2019re about to imply what I think you\u2019re going to imply. I\u2019m not a damn whore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! I wasn\u2019t going to suggest that! I just meant I have so much that it\u2019s not like I\u2019d mind if you stuck around. It\u2019s obviously dangerous out there and I\u2019d be quite the asshole if I just threw you out.\u201d\n\nYou just hang your head down at this remark.\n\n\u201cWell that makes you better than my older sister, but it also makes this harder for me, because it would have been easier if you had been looking for some sort of cynical sex exchange like that.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026so you WANT me to treat you like a whore?\u201d Jack asks confused.\n\u201cNo! Fuck. I just\u2026shit\u2026I dunno what the hell I want\u2026\u201d you say putting your head in your hands.\n\nAt this point Jack tries to interpret your complete mess of explaining things.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think I know what you\u2019re getting at. You just got out of a relationship and you aren\u2019t really in the mood for another guy to be sniffing around you right now. You also want to be by yourself and try to make it on your own without help since you\u2019ve never been truly independent your whole life. Am I right so far?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cYes.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cAnd while you aren\u2019t exactly thinking the worst of me right now, you\u2019re still wisely suspicious enough to wonder why the hell I helped you out if I didn\u2019t want something. Obviously there must be something odd about me, for all you know I\u2019ve been stalking you or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, basically.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, good. Now just let me explain my side of things.\u201d\n\nYou lean again the side of the entryway before Jack goes into his own speech.\n\n\u201cFirst, yes, I do think you\u2019re attractive and from what I know of you, I WOULD like to get to know you a lot better. I thought maybe there was something there during our nice conversation at the comic shop, but I dunno\u2026I sort of\u2026well let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not exactly great at the whole asking someone out thing, so I lost my nerve and had to gather it again by leaving, and of course that\u2019s when those guys showed up. Not to mention I wasn\u2019t really planning on doing that anyway since I didn\u2019t expect to see anyone other than Jake at the register. Which brings me to the second point, I helped you, for the same reason I helped Jake yesterday, it was the right thing to do. I just wasn\u2019t so lucky with him as I was with you. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m some hero, but I\u2019ve always liked to believe I\u2019m not a bad guy. So when I saw the opportunity to get you help, I did it. I assure you there was no ulterior motive.\u201d\n\nAt this point Jack fishes something out of his pocket. It\u2019s keys and a wad of money in a roll. He tosses them to you and you catch them.\n\n\u201cDo I want you to stay here because I like you? Yes, of course I would, but I can\u2019t just keep you here, if you don\u2019t want to be. You sound like you have very strong feelings about trying to make it on your own and being by yourself and I understand that. So since your car was trashed, I\u2019m giving you mine. I\u2019m not going to need it much longer\u2026and no that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to commit suicide. I just won\u2019t be needing it. As for the cash, well you\u2019ll need it more than I will too. You take them both and go live your life and hopefully it will be a good one.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re pretty speechless. You\u2019ve so rarely had anyone be this cool with you and this doesn\u2019t seem to be a \u201cnice guy\u201d act. If it were, he would\u2019ve been calling you a complete cunt the moment you told him you weren\u2019t interested.\n\n\u201cI dunno what to say except thanks.\u201d You say\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Come on I\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Jack responds\n\nJack and you leave the radio room and enter the large open room which has a lot of boxes stacked in it\u2019s four corners. On one of the walls is a door, which Jack says, leads to the outside.\n\n\u201cCar is parked right outside, and is in good working condition. Um, just to let you know though we\u2019re several miles east outside of town. It will be quite the drive, but you should get back to town by nightfall. Remember, I want you to know you can come back here if it looks like the town is in just complete anarchy. I\u2026I still worry about your safety. Anyway, just knock three times on the door and I\u2019ll know it is you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll certainly keep that in mind Jack.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well\u2026good luck Suzy.\u201d Jack says opening the door, which lets in a blinding brightness.\n\nYou look at Jack and then you suddenly hug him and then kiss him on the cheek. You figure it\u2019s the least you can do. Jack wasn\u2019t expecting it though; he returns the hug until you pull away.\n\nYou and he don\u2019t exchange any more words; you just turn around and leave as the door shuts behind you.\n\nYou get in the car, and count up the money to find that Jack has given you a thousand dollars in hundreds. Not much in the long term, but it would at least sustain you awhile.\n\nYou wonder if you should head back to town or just keep driving east and try to start over somewhere else.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head back to town", "result": "Maybe if he\u2019d given you ten or even five thousand you\u2019d feel more comfortable making the risk of \u201cstarting over\u201d but with just a thousand, you\u2019re not that confident even with your new found self sufficient approach to life.\n\nBesides, you\u2019re not even sure where the hell eastward even takes you. For all you know it ends in wilderness, you\u2019ve never been out of your own town before. Better to take your chances with the devil you know.\n\nAs you drive down the empty road, you pass long stretches of trees and wilderness. You never realized until just now how rural in an area you lived in before.\n\nYou briefly check your phone again to see if anyone has called, but as usual nobody has. Nobody cares.\n\nYou continue driving thinking about probably having to deal with the near state of anarchy the town is in. Assuming you even get home in one piece you\u2019ll have to deal with Peter and his car. You figure you\u2019ll have to at least give him this one.\n\nAll of which isn\u2019t going to help you with Kelly who is still intent on throwing you out by the end of the week. Chances are if you attempted to \u201cpay rent\u201d with some of your money she\u2019d just punch you in the face and take ALL of your money and let you stay another month at best which means being on a time limit and scrambling for a job again.

What a joy that\u2019s going to be, dealing with their partying every night. You might as well be living out in the chaos filled streets given how they carry on. Hell, you might even be safer. You\u2019ll definitely have to make sure to keep your newly acquired loot well hidden.\n\nYou try to take you mind off of all this by turning on the radio\u2026Ground Zero ads.\n\n\u201cGround Zero\u2026how fucking original.\u201d You say and turn the radio off, shaking your head.\n\nYou continue driving and driving and driving; your thoughts continuing to go back and forth about why you\u2019re even going back to town.\n\nIt really would be so much easier to just stay with Jack.", "action_results": [{"action": "Keep driving to town", "result": "As much as it might be tempting to go stay with Jack, you need to keep to your plan of self-sufficiency or at least an attempt at it.

It\u2019s sort of eerie, especially as it starts to get dark. At least you don\u2019t have to worry about traffic though.\n\nAs you get within the distance of the town, you wonder just how fucked up it\u2019s gotten since you left, or if order has been restored. You remember Jake mentioned marshal law being enforced in cities across the country. Makes you sort of wonder if the whole damn world is going mad or something.\n\nJust as you get within the town\u2019s limits, you think you notice a large vehicle up head and even people. Then suddenly several spotlights shine in the direction of your vehicle and one right ahead of you. You nearly lose control of your vehicle due to the blinding light and slam on your breaks.\n\n\u201cHALT! BY THE ORDER OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW! ALL ENTRY AND IN AND OUT IS FORBIDDEN! STOP YOUR VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION!\u201d a loud speaker echoes.\n\nThe government has apparently decided to place your shithole town under marshal law as well, you can\u2019t imagine why, but you aren\u2019t even really thinking about that, all you\u2019re thinking about is getting the hell out of here before you get shot, rounded up into a camp or both.\n\n\u201cChrist, Suzy, you ARE fucking jinxed.\u201d You say and then with a deft maneuver you reverse the car and spin it around. You then slam on the gas.\n\nGunshots ring out and your back window is shot out. Soon the sounds of a jeep can be heard followed by more gunfire.\n\nYour attempt to outrun the National Guard prove to be a failure as your back tires are shot and blown out causing your car to spin out of control, flip a few times and then slam into a row of tree along the side of the road.\n\nUnlike the last accident you got into, you aren\u2019t quite as lucky and you are severely injured due to low hanging branches going right through the windshield and impaling you through the chest. By the time the guardsmen reach you, all they find is a bloody mangled corpse.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Turn around", "result": "You suddenly slam on the breaks.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck am I doing? I don\u2019t really want to go back to that shithole town! I don\u2019t want to deal with shit on my own! Fuck this!\u201d you exclaim and then spin the car around.\n\nYou drive back justifying everything in your mind that this isn\u2019t really abandoning your goal of being self sufficient, it\u2019s just a minor set back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to your old ways Suzy, you just need to some help. Jack wants to help so why shouldn\u2019t you let him help? There\u2019s no shame in it. Besides, you\u2019re not going to whore yourself out and he\u2019s not expecting you to. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nAfter several times of thinking this, you have probably managed to convince yourself of it to a minor degree.\n\nEventually as day turns to night you see the Gray Building looming in the distance.\n\n\u201cBesides, it\u2019s very dangerous in town right now. It\u2019s probably safer to stay here anyway. Yeah, it will be safer\u2026\u201d you say ignoring the fact that you\u2019ll be completely alone with a perfect stranger in the middle of nowhere. Well actually you aren\u2019t really ignoring it, so much as you\u2019re trying to mentally block it out.\n\nYou park near the building, get out of the car and head to the door. Remembering that Jack told you to knock three times, you do so and the door opens. Jack isn\u2019t at the door, but you assume he\u2019s probably got it on some sort of automatic system.\n\nYou enter the large front room and shortly after the door closes, you see Jack exiting one of those rooms in the back and quickly walking towards you.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Are you alright?! You\u2019re not hurt are you?\u201d He asks.\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m fine Jack. I just decided that you might be right about how dangerous the town is right now and I should stay here awhile just to play it safe. No point in being proud for no reason.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo you never actually got back to town?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the town is currently under marshal law as well. After fucking around with the radio a bit more, I managed to get a little more info on that military frequency. My heart sank when I heard it knowing you were probably heading back that way. To be honest, I really worried.\u201d\n\nIf Jack\u2019s playing up his concern, he\u2019s doing a really good job because you\u2019re fairly convinced he\u2019s being genuine.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess its good I decided to come back then.\u201d You say realizing that this happy coincidence is only going to reinforce your more slothful tendencies. Still, you ARE glad you avoided potentially getting shot by the National Guard or something.\n\nAttempting to avoid awkward silence you move on to a topic of immediate need.\n\n\u201cSo, you got a shower I can use? I think I\u2019m about due.\u201d\n\u201cSure, you know that room you woke up at? Well there\u2019s a bathroom on that same side of the corridor towards the end of it, can\u2019t miss it mainly because it actually has a door on it. Plenty of unused towels too\u2026um, I don\u2019t really have any spare women\u2019s clothing lying around though. Not that I remember anyway. I suppose anything\u2019s possible with all the shit I have laying around.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll just wear these and figure that out later. I also just realized I haven\u2019t eaten anything since Monday.\u201d\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s a kitchen area across from the bathroom conveniently enough. Help yourself to whatever in the cupboards or refrigerators. Got plenty of stuff. I can even try to cook for you if you tell me what you like.\u201d\n\u201cYou can cook?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not an expert, but I can get by. I\u2019m mostly lazy though and just pop in a frozen dinner.\u201d\n\u201cSame here and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll probably do. No need to trouble yourself.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOkay, well I guess I\u2019ll leave you to it. Oh, and you\u2019re welcome to use that room to sleep in again. I think that\u2019s it, if you need me I\u2019ll be messing about with my radio as usual.\u201d\n\nAt this point Jack raises his arm in a gesture to invite you back to his home.\n\n\u201cThanks Jack.\u201d You say as you walk by.\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d Jack says.\n\nYou head to the bathroom, which is a fairly mundane one with all the usual amenities. Plenty of towels like Jack said. You lock the door and take a much-needed shower. You get a half paranoid thought that Jack is going to suddenly burst in on you, but that doesn\u2019t happen. So far Jack is still staying true to his gentleman form.\n\nYou get dressed and then head to the kitchen where you find Jack wasn\u2019t kidding about having a well stocked one. You grab a drink and find the frozen dinner that takes the least amount of time to heat up in the microwave and then eat. Once again you think Jack is going to come in to check on you, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAfter eating you sort of just sit in the kitchen looking around for a moment. That of course becomes boring fairly fast and you go back to your assigned bedroom, which looks about the same as it did before.\n\nIt isn\u2019t any more interesting in there either. Normally, you would\u2019ve had your laptop to keep you occupied, but it\u2019s sadly back home and you\u2019re unlikely to see it anytime soon. Even your phone has recently gone dead. You almost want to go through the dresser in the room, but you sort of think that would be a bit intrusive since it\u2019s probably just filled with Jack\u2019s things.\n\nLacking any other ideas, you try to go to sleep, but you\u2019re just not tired yet. Not to mention you\u2019re still too anxious about sleeping here. Your usual method of \u201ceasing\u201d yourself to sleep, isn\u2019t an option since for one thing your battery powered boyfriend is also at home. However, even if you wanted to take matters into your own hands, you\u2019d rather not be in the middle of spittin\u2019 the kitten if Jack does decide to walk in to check on you.\n\nSo you do the very thing that\u2019s you\u2019ve been expecting Jack to do to you, you go seek him out to see what he\u2019s doing. (The irony isn\u2019t lost on you)\n\nHe mentioned he would be in that radio room so that\u2019s where you initially head to, but then you hear a few noises in another one of the side rooms. Sounds like a video game.\n\nYou take a look and see a proper living room like area. Odd that you didn\u2019t notice it the first time you were here, but then you weren\u2019t really paying excessive attention to every room you were passing last time.\n\nThere sitting on a sofa is Jack playing a video game on a sizable screen.\n\n\u201cWell I guess you got sick of listening in on the military huh?\u201d you ask causing Jack to look in your direction.\n\u201cOh hey, I thought you\u2019d be asleep or something.\u201d Jack says pausing his game.\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep and I left any sort of stimulus to keep myself entertained at home unfortunately. This looks promising though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGot another controller, you can join right in if you want.\u201d Jack says and points to some controllers on his coffee table.\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll just watch for now.\u201d You say and just as you\u2019re about to sit on the sofa, Jack starts to get up.\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re getting up?\u201d you ask when you sit down.\n\u201cWell I can sit in that seat over there.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cJack it\u2019s your home, no need to move on my account. I\u2019m fully comfortable sitting next to you. I need to get over my paranoid scenarios about you anyway.\u201d\n\u201cScenarios?\u201d Jack asks while sitting back down.\n\u201cYeah, I kept thinking you were going to come rape me in the shower.\u201d\n\u201cYikes. I thought you said you didn\u2019t think I was a serial killing rapist anymore.\u201d Jack says not taking offense and going back to his game.\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026well I can\u2019t help thinking the worst of people.\u201d\n\u201cWell I get that.\u201d\n\u201cIf it helps, I\u2019m about ninety nine percent sure that you aren\u2019t a serial killing rapists anymore and I just think there is something weird about you.\u201d\n\u201cWell looks like I\u2019m doing better then.\u201d Jack says with a smile.\n\nYou watch Jack kill something on screen before he speaks again.\n\n\u201cWell Suzy, I\u2019m not sure if this is going to disappoint you, but I\u2019m going to admit something to you that I\u2019ve never told anyone before.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cUh oh.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019m completely boring. Seriously, there is nothing remarkable about me at all. Like I said, I mainly kept to myself and lived in my mom\u2019s basement until she tragically died, then I lived alone in her house\u2026and now I live here. The end. Oh and collected a bunch of shit along the way.\u201d\n\u201cWow, way to sell yourself to me there Jack.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I figure if saving your life a couple times and being honest isn\u2019t going to get you to like me, nothing will.\u201d Jack chuckles, causing you to snicker a bit too.\n\u201cHah, I knew that\u2019s why you saved me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh well, I guess the secret\u2019s out.\u201d Jack replies.\n\nYou have to admit, you\u2019re starting to become more at ease with Jack, the guy is very laid back and you\u2019re certainly not used to dealing with that sort of personality. The closest was your older brother Ben\u2019s hippy wife Moonshadow and she was an annoying flake. (She did have pretty eyes though)\n\n\u201cSo am I actually going to learn anything more about you?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cYou know what Jack? I think you will, what the hell\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nYou open up to Jack, and begin telling him of your life. The funny thing is while you find it pretty dull Jack finds it pretty fascinating. You imagine that\u2019s probably due to your \u201ccolorful\u201d family members who probably would be a lot more amusing to someone else not having the burden of dealing with them.\n\nJack stops playing his game altogether when you start going into your Uncle Ed and Bobby. He hangs on every word, asking you for clarification at times which you provide.\n\nYou don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling him all this stuff, you suppose it\u2019s because you feel very comfortable with him, not to mention telling him all this stuff almost feel like a weight has been lifted off of you, since it isn\u2019t like you talk to anyone normally.\n\n\u201cHoly shit Suzy. Your life wasn\u2019t all that boring what with all the psycho family members and your cultist ex. Wow. Maybe I should be scared of you given how you managed to survive it all.\u201d Jack says after hearing everything.\n\u201cEh, seems like someone\u2019s always saved me or I\u2019ve been lucky. I mean Bobby saved me from my uncle. That\u2019s probably why I fell in love with him\u2026(Sigh) Sort of fucked up right?\u201d\n\u201cWell I think I understand it. I dunno, never been in that position myself, so I\u2019m not really one to judge. Obviously it was love while it lasted. I mean he didn\u2019t try to kill you when you broke up.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. So how about you?\u201d you ask though you\u2019re starting to get sleepy.\n\u201cHow about me what?\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cAny long lost loves in your life?\u201d\n\u201cNot really any love whatsoever really\u2026it\u2019s a rather depressing tale. I\u2019d rather keep the conversation upbeat.\u201d\n\u201cMm. Shit, wave of sleep is starting to hit me.\u201d You say and then yawn.\n\n\u201cAre you going to bed?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cYou mind if I just sleep on this sofa? I think I mentioned how I\u2019m used to sleeping on one.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cSure. Sure. I\u2019ll move and you just stretch out and be comfortable.\u201d Jack says and gets up so you can lie down fully.\n\nJack turns off his console and as you settle in to sleep you continue to speak a bit.\n\n\u201cI like you Jack.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI like you too Suzy\u2026um\u2026I feel I should tell you something though since you were so open with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re a serial killer rapist after all? Well, if I\u2019m still alive tomorrow, I think I\u2019ll be able to look past the raping if you at least still respect me.\u201d You darkly joke as sleep continues to creep up on you.\n\u201cNo, I just was going to say, while I wasn\u2019t lying about not being a remarkable person, I suppose I\u2019ve acquired some remarkable things in my dealings.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well you can tell me all about your rare antiques tomorrow. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find it interesting.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose I do have some of those, but I was referring to this building actually\u2026um\u2026I guess I\u2019ll tell you tomorrow since it\u2019s really important you know and I think you\u2019ll want to be attentive when you hear it.\u201d Jack says in a serious tone.\n\u201cSure\u2026whatever (Yawn)\u2026\u201d you say.\n\nWith those last words Jack leaves you to sleep and you drift off\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of\u2026well you can\u2019t quite place it. White noise might be the closest thing you can think of, but that wouldn\u2019t be correct. It\u2019s like an annoying hum or buzz going straight to your head. You get up and see that the TV is off from yesterday, so it isn\u2019t that.\n\n\u201cJack? You hear that noise?\u201d you call out in a groggy tone.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any answer, just that increasingly annoying noise.\n\nYou attempt to get up and it takes you a couple tries, not because you\u2019re naturally lazy, but more because you\u2019re starting to feel nauseous. The noise you\u2019re hearing isn\u2019t helping matters.\n\nYou get up on your feet and stagger to the door way which when you get to, you lean up against and feel like you\u2019re going to puke.\n\n\u201cJack\u2026\u201d you just barely manage to shout, before you have to stop to keep from vomiting.\n\nYou look up and down the corridor and find that the lights are flickering. Some are out completely. You have no idea what the hell is going on, but you\u2019d probably be more scared if you didn\u2019t feel so sick.\n\nMustering up all your willpower, you head to the bedroom thinking Jack might be asleep in there. Nobody there, but you can\u2019t fight the sickness any longer and you run as fast as you can to the bathroom nearly falling over in the process.\n\nYou just barely manage to make it to throw up in the toilet. The lights are going nuts at this point and you notice the bathtub and sink are both on. After recovering a bit, you notice the stuff coming out of the sink isn\u2019t exactly water. It\u2019s black and tarry looking. You don\u2019t risk touching it, you just get the hell out of the bathroom.\n\nNo sooner have you done this, when a sudden loud noise hits you so hard you actually stumble and fall to the floor. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to describe the sound, it\u2019s just really horrible and even though you\u2019ve just puked, you still feel pretty damn nauseous.\n\nPicking yourself back up and leaning against the wall, you slowly try to make your way to the room where Jack was messing about with his radio stuff. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re getting anywhere though, in fact the more you walk, the more you feel like you\u2019re on a treadmill in an endless corridor.\n\nYou continue on, but as you pass by rooms you can swear you\u2019re seeing weird things out the corner of your eye. You then start thinking you\u2019re seeing shit in front of you as well. Shadowy humanoid figures blink in and out existence along with the lighting.\n\nAt this point the feeling of terror is becoming stronger than your feeling of sickness. The white noise is still drilling into your head, but now it\u2019s accompanied by an insane laugh, which varies in pitch and tone. When you pass the flight of stairs, you hear whispery voices beckoning you go in that direction. You\u2019re hardly enticed to do so.\n\nAs you get closer to the radio room, the shadowy figures can be seen running about in the large room up ahead. As you get closer, these figures are becoming less shadowy and more \u201csolid.\u201d These figures are starting to no longer look humanoid either.\n\nIt is around this time that you notice your surroundings are becoming\u2026 warped. Walls are melting around you and you\u2019re seeing those shadowy figures in the next room starting to move in slow motion one moment and then other times you see them rapidly moving back and forth in a repetitious manner. You nearly jump out of your skin when several of these beings appear right in front of you and you get a good look at them now that they aren\u2019t so shadowy anymore.\n\nThey\u2019re a mass of tentacles, teeth and misshaped features that would make any horror movie demon jealous, unfortunately this is no movie. The screeching, wailing, and gibbering are bad enough, the visual is bad enough, but the fetid smell is what puts it over the top in just vile nastiness.\n\nYou see one particularly disgusting one with a mutilated face like raw meat and a the scent of a rotten corpse on a hot day, transform into something even worse looking before it opens three of its mouths to reveal its tongues which not only look infested with disease, but have ugly little faces on them.\n\nWhen it attempts to lick you, you turn and run only to find yourself in a wide open space where everything now looks like it\u2019s been put through a multicolored filter. You feel like you\u2019re in a rainbow void. When you look behind you however all you see is darkness save for the creatures now moving towards you.\n\nYou don\u2019t run far when all of a sudden the rainbow filter disappears and is replaced by a flickering affect that you\u2019re actually back in a \u201creal\u201d location. It isn\u2019t the corridor though, it resembles more of a large college auditorium and in the center is a single figure sitting in a lotus position.\n\nHe\u2019s bald and not dressed in modern clothing and in fact looks like he\u2019s from some sort of nerd cosplay convention. He appears human however.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s about him that doesn\u2019t look human though is his eyes are completely white and not just normal \u201cblind eyes\u201d sort either. They\u2019re glowing pure white light.\n\nYou become very disorientated as the flickering of this reality disappears and slowly just becomes a blank gray open space with more gray as far as you can see despite there not being any more walls. You see that the creatures behind you aren\u2019t following, but they definitely want to get closer. It would seem this man\u2019s presence is at least holding them back somehow. At this point you you\u2019re completely lost to as what is going on, but you approach the man if it means keeping the monsters at bay.\n\nThe man suddenly speaks as you get close to him. He\u2019s not really looking at you though, more like looking through you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026I\u2026don\u2019t belong here\u2026everything changes\u2026so many changes\u2026been here\u2026before\u2026somewhere else\u2026so much to do\u2026bring balance\u2026the future is beautiful\u2026the past is beautiful\u2026everything is ugly\u2026corrupted\u2026it\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d the man utters in a fragmented way and you have no idea what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cWhere is Jack?! What\u2019s going on? Who are you?!\u201d you ask trying to figure out this situation.\n\nTo your horror you notice your hands and arms become weathered and wrinkled. From what you can tell, your hair has gone completely white as well. With some hesitation, you feel your face and it definitely doesn\u2019t feel smooth anymore.\n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d you utter.\n\n\u201c\u2026time is short\u2026fleeting life\u2026the others do not like this place\u2026disrupts balance\u2026\u201d the man says still not moving from his spot.\n\nYou then notice your hands and everything else have gone back to normal. This entire situation is very fucked up, and you don\u2019t have the faintest idea what\u2019s going on, but you hope that \u201cMr. Lotus\u201d has some answers with all the cryptic shit he\u2019s spouting.\n\n\u201cLook! I need answers! What is going on here and who are you?!\u201d you ask again while still looking back to make sure those creatures are still staying away from you.\n\n\u201cA footnote\u2026forgotten\u2026 traveller\u2026cursed\u2026blessed\u2026nobody\u2026 you must choose\u2026 Suzy\u2026\u201d the man utters.\n\u201cHow did you know my\u2026\u201d you start to ask before you\u2019re interrupted.\n\u201cYou must choose\u2026the others\u2026they come\u2026\u201d\n\nYou turn your head and see that the monsters and the darkness are indeed starting to move towards you once again.\n\n\u201cChoose? Choose what?! What are you talking about?!\u201d you ask again.\n\u201cYou must choose\u2026\u201d the man says again with less of an air of indifference and more of one of authority.\n\u201cWhat am I choosing?\u201d\n\nThe area surrounding you and the man begins to darken and now you\u2019re getting creatures starting surround you as well.\n\n\u201cYou must choose or die\u2026\u201d the man says again.\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I choose! But what the fuck am I choosing!?!\u201d you shout with a mixture of fear and frustration.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time comes\u2026\u201d the man says.\n\nFor a brief moment your surroundings change from that of the large classroom auditorium again with the man still in front of you. The blackness has disappeared, but the monsters have not as you see several floating tentacle creatures in the room with you. They aren\u2019t quite as disgusting, but they\u2019re still dangerous and giving off that aura that\u2019s making you feel nauseous again.\n\nJust as you think you see a more humanoid figure enter the room there is suddenly a blinding flash all around you causing you to shield your eyes. Everything goes completely white, to completely black and then when you open your eyes again, you find yourself in the large front room of the building. Items are no longer neatly stack and are instead scattered about all over the place, some of them probably broken.\n\nStill completely baffled by what the fuck is going on, you look around for something to protect yourself with amongst the junk all over the floor. You eventually see a sturdy looking bat and pick it up. Upon inspection you notice the words \u201cRUTH\u201d on it, no doubt one of Jack\u2019s valuable purchases.\n\nSpeaking of Jack you still haven\u2019t seen him, but you soon hear him.\n\n\u201cSuzy?! Suzy? Are you here? Where are you?\u201d you hear him call out. Sounds like it\u2019s coming from the corridor, but you don\u2019t see anyone. Maybe he\u2019s upstairs? You haven\u2019t been up there yet, but given what you just experienced, you\u2019re a little reluctant to go deeper into this place.\n\nYou remember Jack said he was going to tell you something about this building before you fell asleep, well whatever that was, it\u2019s apparent that you were right that something about him was weird. Not just weird, but dangerous.\n\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to quite get some of the images out of your head, you even feel a little different. Maybe the sensory overload has made you a bit numb rather than reducing you to a gibbering wreck.\n\nNumb or not, you still have a good mind to just walk out the front door and get the hell out of here.\n\nMaybe this was the \u201cchoice\u201d that strange guy was talking about.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the building", "result": "You like Jack and all, but obviously you need to break this habit of going for guys that save you and have really complicated baggage.\n\nYou head towards the door, open it revealing that it\u2019s almost night already and get out of the building. Your car is still parked in the same location and you waste no time in starting it up and driving away.\n\nYou almost don\u2019t want to look back at the building, but you\u2019re compelled to do so anyway. However when you do, you see absolutely nothing in your rear view mirror.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d you say and then briefly turn your head to look directly and it\u2019s confirmed, the Gray Building is gone. You didn\u2019t see it disappear, but it obviously has. Where, you have no idea, but you feel a little bad for leaving Jack now. You can only imagine what might have happened to him.\n\n\u201cHe already knew what that building was, Suzy. He\u2019ll be fine and if he isn\u2019t\u2026well YOU had to get out of there right? In fact HE\u2019S an asshole for not telling you what the hell that damn building was about in the first place\u2026yeah\u2026goddamn it\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nIn your haste to forget about some of the stuff you saw, you absent-mindedly turn the radio on.\n\n\u201cFuck, it\u2019s going to just be ads for Ground\u2026what the hell?\u201d you say as you hear something you didn\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201c\u2026and talks today were very successful between the President and several other world leaders. It would seem that despite previous disagreements, tensions in the world are lower than they have been in quite some time. In other news, financial experts say things are looking up for the economy ever since\u2026\u201d\n\nYou change the station and find actual music on; in fact you do this several times and find no annoying Ground Zero ads at all! Just the normal annoying ones in between the music, but the fact that anything else is on is very surprising to you. No doom and gloom as far the news goes too or at least not as bad as it was when you remember.\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nYou also remember that Jack told you he heard on the radio that your town is under marshal law; maybe that\u2019s no longer the case too? You certainly hope so, because you have no idea where else to go.\n\nAs you drive you wonder about the Gray Building and what it might have done. You start forming weird theories, but given what you just went through, maybe they aren\u2019t so weird.\n\nYou first wonder if maybe you went through time somehow. Maybe the passage of time goes slower in there or something. You do remember that frightening bit when you aged and then reverted back briefly. (You look in your mirror again to make sure you are indeed still young and of course you are) Maybe all the troubles in the world subsided and things are back to normal? If so, you can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s just been a couple days and everything would be okay again. You would have had to been gone a long time.\n\nIt also occurs to you that maybe you went back in time and maybe this is before the whole world started going to shit (as well as your town).\n\nThe immediate hole in either of these theories is the fact that the music playing on the radio stations is current. Of course you could just be listening to the \u201coldies\u201d station and perhaps a shitload more time has passed than you thought.\n\nWouldn\u2019t support the going back in time theory though if that\u2019s the case and unless every station is an \u201coldies\u201d station you quickly start dismissing the idea that you might\u2019ve travelled through time.\n\nYou dismiss it altogether when you hear a newsperson on the radio announce today\u2019s date.\n\nSo you haven\u2019t travelled through time\u2026maybe you went to a different dimension? You certainly don\u2019t think those things or that bald guy were from your world. Then there was that flickering effect that you experience where you were in a halfway normal location that looked to be an auditorium.\n\nIf this is a different dimension though, so far a lot of shit is the same. Same famous musicians on the radio at least. Same world leaders mentioned, same celebrities mentioned that you know of.\n\nOf course things seem to be a lot better as far as the world not nearly being on the verge of blowing itself up. You suppose you won\u2019t really know until you get back to town.\n\nThe drive is a long one, and it\u2019s nightfall by the time you reach your town. You aren\u2019t seeing any military trucks or any blockades, so that\u2019s a good sign. As you drive into town, you notice that it isn\u2019t an anarchic mess that it was when you left. It doesn\u2019t even look like there was any riots or disasters at all. Just normal traffic and there isn\u2019t even much of that going on right now.\n\nIt is at this time you know this can\u2019t be your reality and while you\u2019re certain glad you aren\u2019t in immediate danger anymore, you can\u2019t help but feel a bit lost.\n\nWhat are you going to do? Do you still go home? What is home going to be like now? Will you still have the same crappy life? How much is different?\n\nOnce again, about the only thing you can do is find out, hell it isn\u2019t like you have much better to do now.\n\nYou drive home which is a lot easier to do when there aren\u2019t assholes throwing bricks at your windshield or general chaos in the streets.\n\nWhen you arrive at what you presume is still home you park on the street and you notice it\u2019s slightly different. The house doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s in a state of disrepair mainly. It doesn\u2019t look like the lights are on either, which isn\u2019t excessively unusual since Kelly is usually working at this time, Peter\u2019s in the garage and you\u2019re in the basement so there isn\u2019t exactly anyone in the front living room or even upstairs where you might see a light.\n\nPeter\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the driveway either, maybe he\u2019s out or maybe he doesn\u2019t live here, you can\u2019t know. You aren\u2019t even sure if this is your house. Who knows, maybe you don\u2019t even live in this town.\n\nSurprisingly even after all the mess you\u2019ve gone through, you still have your house key so after taking it out of your pocket, you get out of the car an head towards the house.\n\nYou walk up to the front door and you\u2019re about to try your key, but then you wonder if maybe you shouldn\u2019t just ring the bell or knock first.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try your key", "result": "You might as well try your key, if it doesn\u2019t fit then you can ring the bell.\n\nYou try your key. It works! Maybe you live here after all.\n\nIt\u2019s pitch dark inside and you fumble around for a light switch on the wall, but apparently it doesn\u2019t work which already seems like something that would happen in your own house. Unable to achieve illumination that way, you see the silhouette of a lamp in the darkness and you head to it. Unfortunately you end up tripping over a bunch of shit in the dark, because apparently the furniture is arranged differently in this house.\n\nYou end up breaking the lamp in the process of trying to turn it on. You curse and just sit in the dark for a moment holding on to your bruised shin and knee. You then attempt to carefully get up since the last thing you want is broken shards of the lamp in your hand or anywhere else in your body.\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to carefully make your way to the kitchen and turn the light on there, you hear a creaking noise. Sounds like it\u2019s coming from upstairs.\n\nYou go in that direction just in time to see a figure at the top of the stairs followed by the muzzle blast of a double-barreled shotgun. The impact throws you against the wall and you wheeze for breath and cough up blood.\n\n\u201cGot that fucking burglar!\u201d you hear a vaguely familiar voice shout as you bleed out.\n\u201cGeorge?! Is it safe?\u201d another voice calls out. Sounds female and you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re hearing it after all these years\u2026either of the voices actually. But especially hers\u2026\n\nSuddenly the upstairs light comes on which provides just enough illumination to shine down on you and the voice of who you now know belongs to your father becomes very panicked.\n\n\u201cOH SHIT! OH FUCK! BERTHA! BERTHA! CALL 911!\u201d your father shouts and runs down the stairs nearly tripping the process.\n\nHe drops the shotgun and goes over to you, but you\u2019re already well on your way to death.\n\n\u201cSuzy! Oh my fucking god! I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026what are you even doing here?! I thought you were visiting Saturday! I didn\u2019t even know you still had a key to the house! Oh shit! No! Hang on!\u201d\n\nWhile your dad attempts to hold you, your mother who apparently is also very much alive in this reality still doesn\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going on until she sees the carnage.\n\n\u201cSUZY! NO! GEORGE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?\u201d your mom screams and runs down the stairs.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d your father exclaims.\n\nYou can\u2019t talk or do anything except gurgle and choke on blood right now, but as the light begins to fade from your eyes and the life starts leaving your body, you watch your mother approach and tearfully embrace your bloody body.\n\nAnd somehow seeing your mother one last time before you die doesn\u2019t make it quite so bad.\n\nYou just wish it had been under better conditions.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Ring the bell", "result": "Even if your key fits, that\u2019s no guarantee you live here. You could very well be trespassing and if someone is actually in this house right now, you could find yourself in deep shit when the owner finds you and pulls a shotgun on you.\n\nErring on the side of caution, you ring the bell a couple times and knock.\n\nYou wait a few minutes thinking that nobody is home which might mean it\u2019s at least safer to try your key, but then you think you hear footsteps and a voice. Soon you see a light emanating from the front room. Someone has come to answer the door at least.\n\nAn older man opens the door and you can hardly believe your eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s damn near midnight who the hell\u2026Suzy?!\u201d your father says mid rant.\n\u201cDad?\u201d you answer back, not really expecting to see him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you weren\u2019t visiting until Saturday.\u201d Your dad asks.\n\nYou have no answer except a sudden raising of your arms and a smile.\n\n\u201cUm, well surprise!\u201d you utter and go to hug your father, who returns the hug.\n\nIt\u2019s weird, you never really had a close relationship with your father, but somehow seeing him alive AND not being a pathetic drunk that just watches TV pining over your mother makes you a little happier to see him. You wonder what changed?\n\n\u201cWell, okay Suzy. We\u2019re always glad to see you, you know that. Just wish you would\u2019ve called in advance you know?\u201d your father says and invites you in. You notice that the furniture lay out in the living room is different along with the furniture itself. A lot of little things are different really.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d sort of throws you at first since you wonder if your dad is referring to your siblings. However you soon see who he\u2019s referring to and if you couldn\u2019t believe your eyes when seeing your father still alive, you really don\u2019t believe them now.\n\n\u201cGeorge, who is\u2026Suzy? I thought you were visiting Satur\u2026\u201d\n\nYou immediately run to hug your mother before she can even complete her sentence. She\u2019s older looking of course, but you\u2019d recognize her anywhere. You can\u2019t believe you\u2019d ever see her alive again. You\u2019re having a hard time holding back tears of joy.\n\nMeanwhile your parents are both a little perplexed by your behavior.\n\n\u201cI love you mom.\u201d You say squeezing her tightly.\n\u201cWell of course you do. I know that. I love you too, but why are you here at this late hour? You could have called us first, you know how we like to turn in early.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know, I just\u2026I just wanted to see you guys, you know?\u201d you say finally letting go of your mother, yet still staying close to her.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a long drive from Security City, have you slept at all?\u201d you dad asks.\n\u201cA little. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine. So how are you guys?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWe\u2019re good, though there has been a neighborhood burglar skulking about. If he tries coming in here, he\u2019s getting both barrels. It is really late though, and while your mother and I would love to talk, can we do this tomorrow morning? I have to get up to fix this overhead light in the living room which decided to go out today.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026yeah sure. Don\u2019t let me keep you up.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou can sleep in your old room. It\u2019s pretty much the same as when you left it, still haven\u2019t turned it into a storage room or anything in case you were wondering.\u201d Your mom says.\n\u201cOh good, I want to check on some old things I left here anyway.\u201d You say and start to head towards where the basement is only to have your mother call out.\n\u201cUm, Suzy where are you going?\u201d your mom asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should be heading upstairs then and not towards the basement?\u201d\n\nYou nearly face palm for not realizing that maybe you had a different sleeping arrangement in this reality. You play it off with a laugh though.\n\n\u201cOh! Yeah! Hah! I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve had a very long drive and I\u2019m a little loopy and tired I suppose.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou okay Suzy?\u201d your father asks.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I really am. Like I said, I\u2019m just really tired. I\u2019ll probably fall asleep soon after I get to my room.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, I told you about driving when that tired before. You could get into an accident.\u201d Your dad says.\n\u201cOh George, don\u2019t lecture the girl now. Let\u2019s just be glad we have a daughter who is still thoughtful enough to visit us.\u201d Your mother says with a smile and pats you on the shoulder. You return the smile.\n\nYou are really glad to see her again.\n\n\u201c(Yawn) Alright, well if we\u2019re done here, I\u2019m heading back up, you coming Bertha?\u201d your dad asks.\n\u201cYes, Suzy you heading up too? You said you were tired and wanted to go to your room.\u201d Your mom asks.\n\u201cYeah I will soon, but I also haven\u2019t eaten all day, you don\u2019t mind if I grab something out of the fridge right?\u201d\n\u201cYou know better than to ask. Help yourself.\u201d Your mom says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a mess though. Oh and remember, your room is the second door on your right.\u201d Your dad snorts in jest due to your previous confusion. It\u2019s actually a good thing he told you though since you probably would\u2019ve been fumbling into random rooms when you actually went up there.\n\nYou dad kisses you on the head before saying goodnight and heading up the stairs. Your mom does as well causing you to hug her once again. You almost don\u2019t want to let go, but you know you need to keep it together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad to be back home, I missed you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy, we just spoke a few days ago.\u201d You mom says.\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s just not the same as seeing you in person, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI know sweetheart, we\u2019ll have all day to talk tomorrow. Goodnight.\u201d\n\nYou watch as your mom heads upstairs and you\u2019re soon left alone where you continue to hold it together until you go downstairs into the basement where you finally release your tears.\n\nYou honestly didn\u2019t realize just how much you missed your mother until you saw her again. You certainly were very sad when she died in your reality and for some time after, but overtime you didn\u2019t just move on, part of you just shut down completely. Maybe that explains some of you problems.\n\nAfter composing yourself, you actually take a look around the basement and find that it\u2019s much different than your own. For one, \u201cyour room\u201d is just a storage space full of old clothes, tools and other junk. You almost get a little nervous looking at all the junk as you\u2019re reminded of the Gray Building. You quickly leave the basement, not wishing to dwell on that which led you here in the first place.\n\nYou spend some more time just looking about the house, particularly the pictures which right there is already a major difference since there are barely any in your own house.\n\nYou see several happy family photos, which you attempt to use as a quick way to possibly learn what you can about your \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\nIt looks like your dad wasn\u2019t a travelling lightning rod salesman and worked at the meat processing plant in town since you see a few pictures of him in a factory uniform. Him being around probably helped. Your mom seems like she was still a housewife from what you can tell.\n\nYour brother Ben apparently went into the actual military rather than just being a paranoid survivalist nut. You see a lot of his pictures are of him in uniform. Looks like he got a lot of ribbons and honors too. You also see a picture of him with your best friend Julie in a wedding dress\u2026 they got married! You can imagine Julie from your reality would have liked that considering she always had a crush on him. (Or maybe she just wanted to fuck him, you don\u2019t know exactly or care to think about it) Looks like they had two children, which you can\u2019t even wrap your head around.\n\nYou don\u2019t see as many pictures of your sister Kelly, but they do exist. A lot of her pictures show her in uniform too, but one of a police officer. Seems like your family is really \u201corderly\u201d in this reality. She looks about the same, just with less scars. She still looks mean and serious business in every photo though, so maybe some things never change. No pictures of a boyfriend (or girlfriend) or children.\n\nOne thing you don\u2019t see pictures of are of Donna or Peter. Surely with as many pictures there are displayed, you\u2019d see some. You can only guess your parents stopped having children after you. Which makes you the \u201cbaby\u201d you guess. Might explain why your family is a bit more stable too considering there were less kids to give your parents grief.\n\nFinally, you see pictures of yourself. Quite a few of them in fact. (More than Kelly definitely) You look more or less the same as you did at the various ages you see yourself. You also look pretty happy in every photo and you see that you graduated from college in this reality too. You don\u2019t see yourself in any uniform, so you wonder what you do for a living.\n\nIt\u2019s at this moment you realize that you can no longer ignore that this reality, this family and these memories are not your own. It\u2019s depressing and you also realize that it\u2019s been mentioned that the Suzy of this reality is supposed to be coming for a visit on Saturday.\n\nYou can\u2019t stay here even though you\u2019d like to, you\u2019re going to have to leave before things get weird. You\u2019re also going to have to figure out what you\u2019re going to do with yourself in the long term. In some ways, the fact that the world isn\u2019t going to complete shit, puts the pressure on even more. After all, if the world had ended it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if you figured it out or not.\n\nStill, you\u2019ve got one more day. One more day at least to spend here and enjoy before you figure out what you\u2019re going to do with your life. You deserve that at least right?\n\nAnd so after grabbing a quick snack, you retire to your \u201cold room.\u201d It\u2019s much brighter than your own old one in the basement, but then that because it\u2019s a proper bedroom and not a dank dark basement.\n\nYou look around a bit, but you figure you can better investigate your room tomorrow. Right now you\u2019re too exhausted from today\u2019s events and drained from the emotions of seeing your mother alive and finding out you had a much better life in an alternate reality and how it\u2019s just another example of how life isn\u2019t fair to you even across the fucking multiverse.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up with the sun shining in on your bedroom. You can safely say you haven\u2019t had that experience in a long time, if ever.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what time it is, but knowing you, you probably slept through the morning as usual.\n\nOnce again, you\u2019re stuck in the same clothes you\u2019ve been wearing since the beginning of the week. While you can certainly shower, you\u2019d really rather change clothes at this point so you go through your room and hope that your alternate self left some old clothes in it.\n\nAfter going through some drawers you find that your alternate self has about the same fashion sense as you do, meaning pretty simplistic. The clothing itself tends to be a bit brighter though as everything else seems to be in this reality and it\u2019s starting to get on your nerves.\n\nYou grab a pair of old jeans and a shirt and head to the bathroom where you wash up and later attempt to brush your teeth using your index finger with toothpaste on it. The jeans and shirt are a slightly tight on you though. It\u2019s not enough that your alternate self has a happier life, but the fucking bitch is apparently a size smaller than you as well.\n\n\u201cOh well, I guess I\u2019ll just be that much more popular with horny guys (Sigh) \u2026unfucking believable\u2026\u201d you mutter as you squeeze yourself into the clothes.\n\nAfter getting dressed, you head downstairs. The first thing you see is dad on a small ladder working on the overhead light he mentioned wasn\u2019t working. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen your own dad ever fix anything.\n\n\u201cHey, look who\u2019s finally up. You sleep well? You must have considering it\u2019s the afternoon.\u201d Dad says.\n\u201cYeah, I guess I really needed the sleep. Where\u2019s mom?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cShe\u2019s in the kitchen. Oh meant to ask you, where\u2019s that silver sports car your drive? I didn\u2019t see it in the driveway or even on the street.\u201d\n\nSilver sports car? Seriously? You own a fucking sports car?\n\n\u201cOh, um\u2026yeah I decided not to drive that one here, it\u2019s been giving me trouble lately anyway. I got an older car for cheap to just drive around in; it\u2019s that small blue one outside.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh. Okay. I just thought I\u2019d ask. Like I said, there\u2019s been some burglaries and I was concerned that the criminals had expanded to car theft too. Probably a good idea you didn\u2019t bring it, nobody is likely to steal that thing outside.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d You say and head to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cFucking sports car\u2026\u201d you whisper shaking your head before you greet mom in a friendly manner.\n\n\u201cHey sleeping beauty is finally awake! You sleep well I trust in your old bed?\u201d mom asks while she works on cooking something.\n\u201cYeah. Slept fine. What are you cooking.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m preparing big batch of beef stew. I swear your father would probably not eat anything else. It will take awhile, but I can make you something before then of course.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d You say sitting down.\n\nYour mother smiles at you and you smile back, but you don\u2019t say anything else.\n\nIt\u2019s weird, you wanted to talk with her so much yesterday, but now as reality sets in that she\u2019s not really your mother, you\u2019re sort of at a loss for words and awkwardly silent.\n\nStill, you want to make the most of this time so you struggle to think of a topic without being suspicious.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026uh\u2026how are Ben and Kelly doing?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell Ben is still stationed over in Europe. Not exactly sure what he\u2019s doing over there, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be dangerous for once, which I for one am glad about. Julie and the children I imagine are glad about it too. You talk to her recently?\n\u201cNot for awhile.\u201d You say which is sort of the truth.\n\u201cOh. Well I did hear you two weren\u2019t on speaking terms any longer. I hope you make up though since the pair of you were always good friends and the both of you probably said words neither of you really meant.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d you ask.\n\nYou mother stops chopping potatoes for a moment to address you directly.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, Ben told me that Julie told him that you got in argument with her about how she\u2019s too strict with your niece and nephew and she told you not to tell how to raise her kids. I can\u2019t remember the entire exchange of what else happened except I know she ended up calling you a dyke that won\u2019t ever know what it means to be a mother anyway and then you swore at her and hung up. While I can certainly see Julie\u2019s defensiveness about how to raise her children, I don\u2019t think it was right to say such hateful things, just because of your lifestyle choice.\u201d\n\u201cLifestyle choice?\u201d you say a bit confused as you\u2019re attempting to process everything.\n\u201cOh right. I\u2019m sorry Suzy. I know you were born that way. You explained it very well to your father and me when you came out years ago before graduating from college. We\u2019re just still a little old fashioned in our way of thinking and it lapses at times.\u201d\n\nYou do not believe this\u2026\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a\u2026\u201d you start to say, but then realize why bother correcting her? It would just confuse things for when their real Suzy arrives.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll try to make the attempt with Julie, but she really needs to apologize.\u201d You say instead.\n\u201cYou always were the bigger person. And I wouldn\u2019t give it another thought as far as what she said about being a mother is concerned. There\u2019s always adoption and I also know you people are really big on all that artificial insemination stuff. I\u2019m sure when the time is right you and Heather will\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHeather?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, your girlfriend. Wait, you didn\u2019t break up with her did you? She seemed so nice when you brought her here for us to meet her\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2026I didn\u2019t break up with her, um\u2026 so how is Kelly again?\u201d you ask really wanting to change the subject.\n\n\u201cKelly? Well she\u2019s Kelly. Still one of this town\u2019s finest and doing a good job at it. Wish she\u2019d find a better man to settle down with though. She seems to flip back and forth between these various loser guys that are so far beneath her it isn\u2019t even funny. She really could do so much better and it\u2019s not like there haven\u2019t been several good men that have made genuine attempts to woo her. She doesn\u2019t want to be tied down though and it\u2019s her life I suppose.\u201d\n\nWell now you\u2019ve heard everything. You truly are in bizarro world.\n\n\u201cYou okay dear?\u201d mom asks.\n\u201cYeah, yeah I\u2019m just fine mom.\u201d You answer\n\u201cWell enough about your siblings, how are you doing? You working on a new book yet?\u201d\n\u201cNew book?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you started writing a new book again? I know last time you said you had a bit of writer\u2019s block. Honestly I don\u2019t know how you come up with all the ideas you do. You\u2019ve written like three books already. I know I don\u2019t have the imagination to do that, but you always were creative even as a little girl.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s what you do. You\u2019re a writer. Makes sense actually. In fact you almost want to kick yourself of why the hell you never tried your hand at it in your own reality. You certainly procrastinate enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas in my head I suppose. Writing is never an exact science.\u201d\n\nBefore you have to make up more shit on the fly, dad comes walking in.\n\n\u201cSmells good in here already. Anyway I fixed the light and now I\u2019m going to the hardware store, I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d\n\u201cIf you already fixed the light, why do you have to go to the hardware store?\u201d you mother asks.\n\u201cI have to replenish all the stuff I used.\u201d He says, but mom doesn\u2019t look convinced.\n\u201cOkay I just want to go because I really want a new drill.\u201d Dad breaks down and admits.\n\u201cGeorge you\u2019re really silly sometimes when you try to make up stories.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s where Suzy gets her story telling ability from!\u201d dad remarks and pats you on the shoulder giving you a smile, which you return.\n\n\u201cOkay, see you both later.\u201d Dad remarks and leaves the kitchen with Mom still smiling about the silliness.\n\n\u201cYou and dad seem very happy.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cOf course we are. Why wouldn\u2019t we be? We\u2019re enjoying our elderly years together, we\u2019ve had a successful marriage, we have three successful children that love us, grandchildren, a nice home, what more could one hope for?\u201d\n\nWhat more indeed. You\u2019re still thinking about what the hell you\u2019re going to do with your own life.\n\nDespite a few major differences in your alternate self, you\u2019d still switch places with her. She\u2019s got everything, a formal higher education, successful career, a fancy car, a significant other and most importantly a loving family.\n\nYou begin to get lost in your own head, which is then disrupted by mom.\n\n\u201cSuzy? Suzy?\u201d mom asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cAre you really okay? You\u2019ve been sort of spacing out lately.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. Well like I said, I\u2019ve got a few story ideas in my head and sometimes I get lost in thought.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well I really have to go to the bathroom, can you finish cutting those carrots?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, sure mom.\u201d You reply.\n\nYour mom leaves the kitchen leaving you alone with your thoughts and cutting up carrots. You increasingly become melancholy as you dwell on how things still suck for you and as you\u2019re apt to do, you begin talking to yourself.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, only you could find the negative out of the one relatively positive thing about thing about this fucked up week. Pull yourself together girl. You survived a hell of a lot worse than this. You wanted to be self-sufficient, we this is a good start. A fresh new world is your oyster and you\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly you hear a phone ring. It\u2019s the land phone on the kitchen wall. You walk over and nearly grab it immediately, but then you remember you\u2019re not really supposed to be here.\n\nHowever, you then notice the caller I.D.\n\nSuzy.\n\nYou are compelled to pick up.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cHey. Mom? Is that you?\u201d the voice on the other end says.\n\nYou pause. You never realized that you and your mother sounded so similar before.\n\n\u201cYes, of course it\u2019s me honey. Who else would it be?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI dunno, you sound a little different. Might be that ratty old land phone you have though, I keep telling you to get a cell!\u201d\n\u201cOh you know me dear, your father and I are a bit set in our ways.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it. Ha ha! Nah, I know you guys really do try. So hey, I was just calling to let you know I\u2019m coming a little bit earlier and I\u2019ll probably be there sometime late tonight. Like probably after midnight.\u201d\n\u201cYou are?\u201d\n\u201cYes, like I said I just wanted to let you know so you guys don\u2019t get too mad when I\u2019m knocking on your door late at night waking you up\u2026unless you want me to stay at the town\u2019s motel until tomorrow morning. I know you guys go to bed early.\u201d\n\nIt is at this moment that the dark idea your mind has been dancing around for quite some time isn\u2019t going away and is now in full bloom.\n\nIf you just got rid of this Suzy, all your problems would be solved. You just have to muster the fortitude to do it\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell Suzy to go to the motel", "result": "If you\u2019re going to do this, it\u2019s better that you do it away from the house. There is exactly one motel in this town anyway so it\u2019ll be real easy to find her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, but your father has been a bit jumpy lately due to a recent string of burglaries. I wouldn\u2019t want him suddenly pulling a shotgun on you just because you\u2019re knocking on the door in the middle of the night. Nevermind the fact he\u2019ll be pretty grumpy anyway. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping well as you might expect.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cYikes! Well I guess maybe I should stay at the motel then, I don\u2019t want to cause grief. The Jinn Inn is still open right?\u201d she says.\n\u201cYep, as far as I know.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cOkay, guess I\u2019m staying there. Ugh, just hate the idea of staying there due to it being so dirty looking. It\u2019s like one step up from that awful trailer park outside of town. I dunno how that place has stayed open so long.\u201d\n\u201cWell the hookers in town need to ply their trade somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cMom! I\u2019ve never heard you talk like that before!\u201d She exclaims.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not a prude dear, despite what you might think of me.\u201d\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a prude. I know you\u2019re very open-minded. You\u2019re just usually pretty reserved with how your talk.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m full of surprises, just like you are. Where do you think you got it from?\u201d\n\u201cHah, guess you\u2019re right. Okay then, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t really talk so much while I drive. I guess I\u2019ll be seeing you on Saturday after all. Give my love to dad.\u201d\n\u201cI will dear.\u201d\n\u201cI love you mom.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too Suzy.\u201d You say before hanging up.\n\nYou don\u2019t have much time, you have to prepare and make a plan of what you\u2019re going to do.\n\n\u201cDid I hear you on the phone out here?\u201d you mother says walking into the kitchen.\n\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah just someone trying to sell something. They were really persistent.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI can tell, you hardly cut up any of the carrots.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I guess I got caught up in telling them to never call here again. I should have just hung up I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ve gotten directly angry at those telemarketer types too.\u201d\n\u201cHey mom, I\u2019ve got some things I left here that I want to get and I know they\u2019re probably in my room somewhere or maybe even the basement, you don\u2019t mind if I go take care of that do you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not at all. We can talk later. Let me know if you\u2019re looking for something in particular. I might know where it is.\u201d\n\u201cI will mom.\u201d\n\nYou head to your room to try to formulate a plan. You figure the easiest way to do this is to hang out near or around the motel parking lot and watch for a silver sports car. When you see what room she goes to, you can just blitz attack her as she\u2019s attempting to open it up and take care of her in the motel room itself. You just need to be quick.\n\nSo, now that you have her, now you have to kill her. You\u2019re going to need something quick and not noisy. A knife you suppose, but that might take more than one stab unless you cut her throat or something. The bat you got from the Gray Building might work, if you smash her in the head multiple times. The thing is you don\u2019t want is to splatter a bunch of blood all over the place. The Jinn Inn might be shady and dirty enough that a few blood spots on their carpets aren\u2019t going to raise an eyebrow, but if you make it look like the chainsaw massacre, you will cause attention and it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re going to have all the time in the world to clean it up. The goal is to make the kill and replace her as efficiently as possible.\n\nWhich brings you to the idea of how you\u2019re going to dispose of the body since you can\u2019t just leave a dead doppelganger of yourself in the motel room. You\u2019re definitely going to have to haul it out into the wilderness-surrounding town. Dragging it to one of the trunks of the car is going to be the most difficult part. (You still aren\u2019t sure which one you\u2019ll take) Dragging her body out might be less risky if you at least wrapped it in something; you think you saw some things in the basement that might come in useful.\n\nOnce you get the body into the trunk though, you just need to drive far enough away so it isn\u2019t discovered. Even if it is, maybe you should mutilate the face so it can\u2019t be identified. Pull out the teeth?\n\nYour murder plans are temporarily broken up by your thoughts of Bobby. You didn\u2019t often speak to Bobby about his \u201creligious practices\u201d, but in the few times you dared to ask questions, he did explain helpfully about how he went about things. You never dreamed that such knowledge might come in handy.\n\nYou make a mental note of everything you might need. You grab an old duffle bag out of the closet and fill it with some of her old clothing from her drawers. You figure you\u2019re probably going to need new clothing to wear after your grim work.\n\nWhen you head downstairs you find that dad has returned.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, where are you off to?\u201d\n\u201cOh just putting some stuff of mine in the car, hey dad I was thinking about painting my place when I get back home. I noticed some old tarps and blankets in the basement, you wouldn\u2019t mind if I took those would you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh no, go ahead. Take whatever you might need.\u201d He says.\n\nYou head to your car and throw the duffle bag in, then you return to the house and head down into the basement.\n\nYou grab some of the folded up tarps and then you notice some of the old tools and other junk down here. Are you going to need an axe to chop up the body? Maybe you should take a shovel to bury it in the wilderness? You remember they stuffed a body into a luggage case in one movie\u2026\n\n\u201cFuck it, I\u2019m still not sure what I\u2019m going to do, I better just take all this shit. Dad did say to help myself.\u201d You say and make a couple trips up and down the basement, loading up your car with tools, tape, bags, and tarps in the process. (And being to keep the shovel and axe hidden within the tarps since the last thing you need is a question about why you might need those)\n\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019re about ready to go do the deed right now, but it\u2019s still too early. Besides, you can\u2019t just disappear for all day and night, your parents would wonder. You\u2019re going to have to come up with an excuse of why you\u2019re going to be gone.\n\nAs you\u2019re piecing together an excuse, when you get back in the house your mom sees and addresses you again.\n\n\u201cYou going to have dinner with us in a half hour or so?\u201d she asks.\n\u201c\u2026yes\u2026of course. I have to leave though afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cLeave? You just got here!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean leave to go back to Security City, I just mean\u2026well I\u2019ve been in contact with a former school friend through the Internet and she\u2019s sort of been going through some tough times. I promised I\u2019d meet up with her when I was visiting.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026well I certainly understand. Who was this friend? Do I know her? Though I suppose I only ever remember Julie due to you two hanging together a lot.\u201d\n\nYou very briefly blank on making up a name on the spot, however you do come up with one rather quickly.\n\n\u201cUm, Diana. Her name was Diana Morningstar. She never came over here, since her parents were always a bit strict, but I always got along with her in school. She wasn\u2019t very popular, but I always felt a bit sorry for her so I was sort of her only real friend. Though I imagine she probably put more stock into it than I did, I mean I was still just a shallow kid at the time and wanted to hang out with Julie since we could have fun together like normal young teens. I sort of lost contact with her when her parents pulled her out of school altogether and home schooled her. I think they were religious nuts.\u201d\n\nYour mother just shakes her head.\n\n\u201cSee, parents like that just shouldn\u2019t have children. That\u2019s a shame. Well I\u2019m glad to hear that you showed that girl a bit of kindness. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s glad you\u2019re in contact again and will be happy to see you. You always were thoughtful.\u201d Your mother says and then mentions that you should take a spare key for the house from the desk in the front room just in case you come home late and they\u2019re already asleep.\n\nEventually it\u2019s dinnertime and you have dinner with your mom and dad. Through a bit of conversation you do learn a little more about your \u201clife\u201d here and through careful weaving and quick thinking, you manage to navigate through questions you might not otherwise know the answers to. To be honest though, you\u2019re only just barely paying attention to any of it, because you\u2019re so preoccupied.\n\nWhile you\u2019re apparently calm on the outside, you\u2019re really a ball of nervous energy and as soon as dinner is over you nearly rush out of the house, though you do grab the spare house key for appearances.\n\nYou say goodbye to your parents and leave the house. It\u2019s night, but it\u2019s still too early for her to be at the motel yet, well at least you hope that\u2019s the case since that will change up your plans of how to get to her.\n\nYou spend a bit of time driving around trying to put yourself in the mind frame to do this. You can\u2019t afford to choke; this is a life or death decision quite literally. You need to do this for your future life here. The life that you deserved\u2026but why are you so much more deserving? Didn\u2019t this Suzy work hard to get what she got even if she had a few advantages? Are you just too overwhelmed with jealousy? How can you genuinely desire to find the inner strength to kill?\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake Suzy, you were going out with a cultist for fuck\u2019s sake and you had no problem with him killing people! Is this really all that surprising?\u201d you exclaim to yourself.\n\nMaybe this is genetic. Maybe you take after Uncle Ed. (Who you learned didn\u2019t exist in this reality when your mom mentioned being an only child at dinner) Maybe it was your fucked up upbringing. Maybe it was your environment. Maybe there was always darkness in you and you were just too damn lazy for it ever to fully thrive.\n\nWell it\u2019s thriving now. Is it ever. You\u2019ve got more motivation than you ever have before. Maybe it\u2019s because there is so much at stake. Maybe it\u2019s because on some level you actually hate yourself and by killing this Suzy, well it\u2019s like killing yourself without the actual downside of dying.\n\nWhatever the reason, you can\u2019t waste anymore time thinking about whether this is right or wrong. Your life hasn\u2019t exactly been \u201cright\u201d for a very long time, but if everything goes according to plan, your life will be getting there.\n\nWell at least that\u2019s how you\u2019re convincing yourself this time around. Just like you\u2019ve convinced yourself of several other things this week, you succeed in convincing yourself of this too. It\u2019s getting a lot easier.\n\nYou stop driving around town and finally head to the motel. You\u2019ll wait the rest of the time out in the parking lot.\n\nWhen you get to the Jinn Inn, it isn\u2019t quite as bad as the one in your reality, but you definitely see some shady characters popping into the rooms. You see no sign of a silver sports car though and you do take the time to check. She\u2019s not here yet so you just park in a strategic location where you can see all the traffic coming in and out. When she arrives, you\u2019ll definitely see her.\n\nHours pass, but you never lose focus. And eventually your vigilance pays off. You see a silver sports car. It actually isn\u2019t as fancy as you thought it might be, probably was bought used, but it\u2019s certainly more than you ever had.\n\nYou watch her park close to the motel rooms and then you see her get out of the car. She\u2019s dressed in casual clothing and carries a small purse, but when you watch her walk to the motel check in office, you notice she carries herself with an air of self-confidence. It\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t matter that the area she\u2019s around is shit, she knows she\u2019s better and isn\u2019t at all intimidated by the element here.\n\nIt is at this moment you grab your baseball bat and get out of the car still keeping an eye out and crouching down behind the vehicles. Fortunately nobody else happens to be lingering around the lot at the moment. Hopefully it stays that way.\n\nYou soon see her come out of the check in office and as stealthily as you can you run over behind more cars and get closer. You watch where she walks to and continue to keep a look out for anyone else that might suddenly pop up. You just need to stay hidden as you follow her and then rush her when she finally opens up her room. You silently thank your luck for once since she seems to not be very aware of her surroundings and only focuses on heading towards her room.\n\n\u201cStupid, arrogant bitch\u2026\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nYour stalking soon ends when you see her reach her room. It\u2019s a perfect opening too. Nobody is around and she fumbles with the keys a bit giving you time to get closer before making that mad sprint as soon as she opens her room\u2026 and then you strike.\n\nYour target opens the door and enters her room. She turns around to close the door just in time to see you up close in front of her hitting her with face with the bat. It isn\u2019t a full swing, but rather a hard \u201cpoke\u201d, but it\u2019s enough to break her nose and cause her to go falling to the floor.\n\nYou quickly slam the door shut behind you and you briefly think about beating her brains in with the bat, but then you realize that will probably be messy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d is all she manages to get out before you kick her in the face to shut her up. Then you pounce on top of her and after turning her over, you use the bat sideways and you press it up against her throat as hard as you can as you pull back.\n\nShe gasps and struggles for her life, but it\u2019s no use, your determination to kill her is much stronger than her abilities to fight for her life.\n\n\u201cShhhhh\u2026just let go\u2026.just let go\u2026everything is going to work out and your parents won\u2019t be losing a daughter at all. Just let go\u2026.\u201d You whisper.\n\nSoon you hear a crunching sound of perhaps crushing bones in her neck or her windpipe or something. Whatever it is, her struggle temporarily becomes more violent and jerky with her limbs attempting to flail about. It almost feels like you\u2019re riding her like a wild pony, but soon this outburst is muted and then nothing.\n\nSuzy collapses dying with her face partially in a small puddle of her blood and spital, leaving you sitting on top of a corpse\u2019s back. You eventually stand up taking in what you\u2019ve done. You\u2019re hot and sweaty, but strangely invigorated.\n\n\u201c(Whew) And I thought I was going to choke.\u201d you say and then start to chuckle at your own dark joke.\n\nWell the first part of the deed is done, now comes the more labor inducing part. Getting rid of her body.\n\nYou\u2019ve actually managed to keep the mess to a minimum by choking her to death, so you\u2019re wondering if you shouldn\u2019t just grab the tarps from the car, roll her ass up in them, duct tape it together and take her to the trunk.\n\nShe might be your size, (Okay slightly lighter) but it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re used to carrying bodies around. While there wasn\u2019t anyone out there, the last thing you need is someone seeing you fumbling around with a body, even one wrapped in a tarp.\n\nIf you wanted to play it safe, you suppose you could drag her to the bathroom and chop her up in the bathtub. It will definitely take longer and you might make more of a mess, but you could always carry her out in several pieces in that big luggage bag you brought with you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Keep her in one piece", "result": "The more you think about it, chopping her up is likely just going to complicate things. Your goal is to get rid of her body as quickly as possible and really all you need to do that is drive her dead ass to the wilderness and dump it. You probably over thought this by bringing all that shit with you.\n\nNo matter, better to have it and not need it rather than the other way around.\n\nYou quickly search her body, but find nothing of interest. The purse that she dropped on the floor when you smashed her in the face contains all the important stuff, but you figure you\u2019ll have to go through it when you have more time.\n\nYou go to the car grabbing the tape and tarps and return to the room. So far it\u2019s still pretty quiet out there, you just hope it stays that way.\n\nYou begin rolling her up in one of the tarps and then wrap duct tape around her like mummy. You then roll her up in a second tarp, which you also tape up. It\u2019s not exactly the neatest, but you believe you\u2019ve got her firmly wrapped up tight.\n\nYou make the effort to clean up a little bit of the blood that was left on the motel carpet, you only got soap and water from the bathroom to work with, but it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re cleaning up brains and gore so you think you\u2019re good.\n\nYou sit on the bed for a little while taking a break from your task thinking about which car you want to use. You suppose it doesn\u2019t matter, though the sports car probably has a smaller trunk, then again you loaded up your own car with a bunch of stuff, so you\u2019re probably going to have to rearrange stuff to make room.\n\nYou get up and using the car keys from the purse, you check out the sports car to see just how big the trunk is. After some inspection you decide that it\u2019s probably just big enough for your purposes. It isn\u2019t like it\u2019s a big body after all.\n\nYou still think it might be a good idea to bury the body though, so you grab the shovel out of your car and put it in the backseat of the sports car.\n\n\u201cOkay Suzy, let\u2019s do this.\u201d You say to yourself and head back inside to get her body.\n\nYou pick up the body and it really isn\u2019t easy. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re literally carrying \u201cyour own weight\u201d on a regular basis, not to mention a dead body is somewhat awkward to attempt to carry even if you do have it wrapped tight.\n\nYou get to the trunk of the sports car and start swearing when the body\u2019s weight begins to take its toll and you even up dropping it on the cement before you can even attempt to get it into the trunk.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you exclaim and then quickly look around to see if anyone is watching or around. You\u2019re still in luck that nobody is around. (You guess the hookers are really busy with their tricks tonight)\n\nWith some effort, you manage to pick the body back up and cram it into the trunk. Cram is definitely the correct word since you miscalculated and the trunk was slightly smaller than your thought. You actually have to lift your leg to stomp the body into the trunk before you can close it properly.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done with that, you go back into the room to make sure you haven\u2019t forgotten anything and grab her purse before you leave.\n\nAs you start up the car and leave you figure you\u2019ll drive north of town, drag her into the woods, find a good spot and start digging a hole. You have no idea how long that\u2019s all going to take, but you imagine you\u2019ll have to come up with another excuse for your parents about why you were out all night. You figure you\u2019ll just make up something about Diana again. Never thought that bitch would come in so handy.\n\nYou also figure you\u2019ll have to come back for your own car as well since it will look pretty strange coming back home with the silver one. You suppose when you finally stop \u201cvisiting\u201d your parents you can always come back for the silver one and just abandon this one.\n\nIt\u2019s all a lot to deal with still, and you\u2019re already partially frustrated and tired from all the dead body lifting.\n\nThanks to this fatigue and the sports car going slightly faster than when you were driving the other one, you end up going past the designated speed limit in the area and misfortune strikes, you attract the attention of a hidden police vehicle. The sirens and blinking lights soon follow.\n\nYou curse loudly and briefly think about just speeding up and getting the hell out of town, but you instead remain calm. You have this Suzy\u2019s ID and everything so as long as you don\u2019t act suspicious, you\u2019ll probably be fine. In fact, knowing the cops in this town, all you\u2019ll have to do is flutter your eye lashes at them a bit and you\u2019ll probably get let go with just a warning.\n\nYou slow down and pull over.\n\n\u201cKeep your head Suzy, you\u2019re in the home stretch\u2026\u201d you say closing your eyes and trying to maintain your cool.\n\nA tall and bulky cop soon comes out of the car and walks over to you. At first you figure it\u2019s going to be a guy, but then your heart sinks when you see who it really is.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, if it isn\u2019t baby sister.\u201d Kelly remarks.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d You inadvertently exclaim, losing whatever composure you were attempting to have.\n\u201cFuck? Now is that anyway to greet your big sister? I heard you were in town visiting mom and dad. What are you doing out so late breaking traffic laws?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just coming back from an old friend\u2019s house okay? And I wasn\u2019t that much over the speed limit.\u201d\n\u201cRules are rules Suzy, but then you always DID think there was a separate set of rules for you didn\u2019t you? Yeah, always the favorite getting your own way\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe this. Even in this reality, Kelly is still a fucking jealous bullying asshole to you. Some things never change.\n\nKelly notices you\u2019re looking a little annoyed and anxious by her stop.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Suzy? No pithy come back college girl?\u201d Kelly asks.\n\u201cLook, you win Kelly, you got me. I obviously broke the law and you got me. Just write me the damn ticket already.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cNot sure if I like your tone sis\u2026in fact you\u2019re acting a little odd. What old friend might have you been visiting anyway in this town? Figured when you moved away you were glad to leave everyone behind. Not to mention the only person I ever remember you hanging out with was Julie and I hear you\u2019re not on speaking terms anymore.\u201d\n\u201cJust some girl from school days I\u2019ve had contact with over the Internet. I promised I would visit her. I\u2019m just on my way back to mom and dad\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, girl huh? This wouldn\u2019t be some midnight booty call for you would it? Some old secret labia-licking friend you had when you were still in the closet? I thought you had a steady girlfriend. Guess more rules that you don\u2019t give a shit about.\u201d\n\nYou know you should keep your composure, but Kelly is really getting on your nerves.\n\n\u201cAre you going to give me the ticker or not?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you this fucking baton up your ass if you don\u2019t stop giving me shit! In fact why don\u2019t you get the hell out of the car, you\u2019re acting really suspicious.\u201d Kelly remarks.\n\nYou sigh and shake your head.\n\n\u201cOf course. Nothing is ever easy for me.\u201d you say and then you quickly turn the car back on.\n\n\u201cHEY! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! STOP!\u201d Kelly shouts and grabs at the wheel while you attempt to drive off.\n\nYou manage to actually get a few feet before Kelly manages to grab the key out of the ignition. You punch Kelly in the face multiple times, but she\u2019s undeterred in her job of arresting you.\n\nKelly returns your punches with a couple elbows to the face and then pulls you out of the car through the window.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in deep fucking shit now little sister. You just assaulted a goddamn officer of th\u2026ugh!\u201d Kelly grunts when you punch her as hard as you can in the crotch. It slows her down and you attempt to grab her pistol.\n\nYou manage to undue the snap of the holster, but Kelly stops you from getting and further with a knee to your face. Now SHE pulls out the pistol and points it directly at you.\n\n\u201cSuzy, I\u2019m telling you to fucking stop or I WILL fucking shoot you!\u201d Kelly warns.\n\nYou don\u2019t stop though. Your grand plans have gone to shit once again and you\u2019re a loser here just like you were a loser in your own world. You\u2019re either going to get lucky and wrestle the gun away from Kelly, or she\u2019s going to shoot you. One thing you\u2019re not going to do is go to jail.\n\nKelly sensing her life is in genuine danger now, ignores all the pain she\u2019s in and no longer treats you like her \u201csister\u201d and starts treating you like a dangerous criminal which you actually are at this point.\n\nKelly shoots you once in the chest, dropping you instantly. You strongly get the impression that she COULD have easily stopped you without a fatal shot, but you imagine that Kelly being herself probably saw this as a perfect opportunity.\n\n\u201cI fucking told you sis.\u201d Kelly remarks.\n\u201c(cough) I\u2019m not your fucking sister, asshole. She\u2019s in the goddamn trunk\u2026\u201d you laugh while still coughing up blood at the same time.\n\nYour last moments are looking the confused look on Kelly\u2019s face before she radios for back up and an ambulance.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Chop her up", "result": "If you\u2019re going to do this, you need to do this right. In fact the more you think about it, this isn\u2019t going to be done in one day. However, you can get some of it done tonight if you stay focused.\n\nSure, you\u2019re going to have to come up with a few excuses to your parents of why you were out all night, but you can think them up while you\u2019re taking care of this.\n\nYou quickly search her body, but find nothing of interest. The purse that she dropped on the floor when you smashed her in the face contains all the important stuff, but you figure you can go through it more thoroughly later.\n\nThe first thing you do is leave the room and head directly to the check in office. When you enter you see a slovenly man watching a tv. His leering eyes turn your way and you have no doubt he thinks you\u2019re the same woman from earlier.\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna need that room a little longer.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBusiness that good huh?\u201d he snorts.\n\u201cVery funny, look how much for two more days?\u201d\n\u201cSame price you see on the fucking sign above my head.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well I guess I didn\u2019t see it since I was so mesmerized what with you being such a stud and all.\u201d You say sarcastically while pulling out a couple hundreds out of your pocket.\n\nYou toss the money at him dismissively, but he takes it without question.\n\n\u201cKeep the change and I don\u2019t want anyone disturbing me until its time to check out, got it? That means no house keeping ladies or shit knocking at my door.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHouse keeping ladies? Pfft, no problem there. I got one and she barely does her fucking job as it is. If I wasn\u2019t married to her I would\u2019ve fired her years ago.\u201d The man says and returns to his show.\n\nYou then head to your car where you start bringing in several of the various objects you brought from the house. Takes you a couple trips, but you don\u2019t have any trouble.\n\nThe motel bathroom is fortunately bigger than you expected it to be, it\u2019s also a lot dirtier than you expected it to be. Of course now you\u2019re not so much worried about making a mess so much as you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to catch hepatitis just being in the damn place.\n\nYou lay down tarps on the floor and in the bathtub then you drag her body in. You go grab the axe and study it a bit; hoping that it\u2019s sharp enough that you won\u2019t need to struggle with the whole dismemberment task.\n\nStanding over her body with an axe is a little surreal to you, but you need to stop dwelling on how weird this all is and get on with it.\n\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d You say and swing the axe\u2026\n\nChopping up the body is a mixed feeling. On one hand you\u2019re completely at peace with the deed and everything that goes along with it. The blood and gore isn\u2019t even all that bad since you\u2019ve gotten a bit accustomed to that, but it\u2019s the smell that\u2019s making you feel a little sick.\n\nYou actually have to stop chopping for a moment because you can\u2019t stop gagging. Eventually you just give in and throw up in the toilet nearby. Afterwards, you\u2019re more or less fine. It still isn\u2019t nearly as bad as that fucked up reality warping tentacle monster shadow abominations you had to endure during your time in the Gray Building. You never want to experience something like that again.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ve got severed parts waiting to be wrapped up. You got most of the bloody mess on the tarps, so that\u2019s one less thing to worry about you suppose. You\u2019ll have to dispose of the bloody clothing you\u2019re wearing though.\n\nGetting naked, you return to your large luggage case, which you placed on the bed and open it up to retrieve all the trash bags you took along with the duct tape.\n\nThe wrapping and taping is probably more time consuming than the chopping up part. You don\u2019t really have too many problems except when it comes to the torso which is not fun to deal with since it\u2019s still heavy and blood is leaking everywhere from it.\n\nEventually you get everything in order and before you know it, you\u2019ve got several body parts wrapped fairly tightly in bags and they don\u2019t seem to be leaking either. After washing your hands and arms a bit, you grab the luggage case from the next room.\n\nIt takes some effort and squeezing, but you just barely manage to fit all of the parts in the case. After carefully moving the tarps to drain the blood in the tub, you then fold them up and squeeze them in too, along with your blood drenched clothing. The luggage case itself is made of solid material and you\u2019re confident there won\u2019t be any leakage, but just dragging it back into the main room takes some effort. It definitely isn\u2019t going to be easy to shove into the car trunk.\n\nNext you spend a little time cleaning up a few places where the blood spilled on the floor or splattered on the wall. Most of this was in the bathroom and is relativity easy to get rid of, though you do spend some time scrubbing the carpet a bit where you first choked her out.\n\nAfter you\u2019re done with all of that, you take a shower, which also gets rid of the blood already in the tub. You briefly feel a little like that infamous countess that bathed in the blood of young girls to maintain her youth.\n\nGetting dressed in a new set of clothing you brought in the duffle bag, you finally collapse on the bed not caring how filthy it may or may not be.\n\n\u201cAhhh\u2026shit\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as fatigue sets in.\n\nYou take this opportunity to go a bit through the purse now, starting with the phone. You check the time and see that it\u2019s practically getting up for morning.\n\nYou figure you\u2019ll sleep here for what remains of the night and tomorrow you\u2019ll take the remains to the wilderness and find a good spot to bury them. You imagine your mom will call you at some point, possibly even waking you up. You figure you\u2019ll tell her you had a few drinks with Diana and you didn\u2019t want to risk driving home. She\u2019ll understand that even if she might not approve.\n\nYou also figure you\u2019ll take the blue car when you drive. The shovel is still in that one and you might very well have to stop off at your parent\u2019s house first for some reason anyway if they really make a fuss to want to see you immediately. Better you don\u2019t have to park around the block or something just so you don\u2019t arouse suspicion. You\u2019ll definitely be abandoning the blue one and taking the silver one back when you leave town and head back to Security City though.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just some of what you have to do for tomorrow. You\u2019ll be able to do it though as long as you stay focused on your goals like you have been doing.\n\nAs you begin to drift off, your thoughts briefly focus on Bobby. Seems weird to think of him even now after all you\u2019ve been through this week. You wonder if his family lives in town? Are they still cultists or are they normal?\n\nYou have no idea, there is going to be a lot to learn from this reality, but you can only dwell on \u201cyour\u201d Bobby and what he might think. You certainly are a far cry from that \u201cgood girl\u201d he rescued so long ago. He probably would be proud of you right now.\n\nYou know he\u2019s out of your life forever now, but you still can\u2019t help feel a little sad about it.\n\n\u201cI still wonder if being with you influenced me or what I just did was within me all along. Either way I guess if I stayed with you earlier this week\u2026maybe\u2026maybe\u2026 we could have made it work after all. Another reality perhaps\u2026\u201d you say and close your eyes.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the cell phone ringing. You\u2019re very tired, but when you see who it is, this call isn\u2019t unexpected.\n\n\u201cHey mom\u2026\u201d you groggily reply.\n\u201cHey mom? Where are you? I thought you would\u2019ve come back last night!\u201d your mom exclaims.\n\u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon! Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cMom, mom, mom, calm down. I\u2019m fine. I just\u2026well I drank a little too much\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDrink? You don\u2019t drink!\u201d your mom exclaims.\n\u201cYeah, I know hence why I\u2019ve been more or less out of it. Diana was really distraught last night and she was already drinking a bit when I got over to her place. She got an eviction notice, she broke up with her boyfriend, she lost her job and just a whole bunch of other drama in genera hit her this week. She really needed a friend to speak with and well, I ended up drinking with her since she was sort of insistent and I wanted to be there for her. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but I think she felt better as the night went on. Of course that might have just been the drink\u2026I dunno\u2026I\u2019m sorry for worrying you though.\u201d\n\nThere is a pause after you give your excuse.\n\n\u201cOkay Suzy. I get it. (Sigh) I\u2019m just glad you had the sense not to drive if you really got that drunk though. I do hope this isn\u2019t a habit though, I know you\u2019re an adult, but you\u2019re still my baby and I don\u2019t like to think of you as being some falling down lush.\u201d\n\u201cOh mom, that\u2019s not going to happen. Seriously, like I said, I only did it so Diana would feel better. I fully intend to tell her when she wakes up that this won\u2019t be happening again.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it. So when do you think you\u2019ll be home? Your father and I would still like to see you since you actually came here to visit us remember?\u201d\n\u201cI know, I\u2019ll be home in a few hours I suppose. I still feel woozy from last night. Did you need me over immediately though? Because I can do that if you want.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, you take care of everything you need to over there and come over when you\u2019re feeling up to driving. Don\u2019t want you getting into an accident because you\u2019re not feeling one hundred percent.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I will be over as soon as I can though.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll see you then. Love you Suzy.\u201d\n\u201cI love you mom.\u201d\n\nYou hang up and rub your eyes a bit.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s one thing out of the way. Better get on with the more important task.\u201d You say.\n\nYou open up the door to your room and see a closer parking spot to your room, which is good since you really don\u2019t want to drag that case too far.\n\nYou go to your car and bring it in closer and then head back to your room to gather up everything.\n\n\nYou gather up the bat and axe (which you also wash off in the tub) and toss them in the trunk. Next, you grab the luggage case. With some effort, you drag it to the trunk and lift it inside. You\u2019re really glad you decided to chop her up, you can\u2019t imagine how awkward it would\u2019ve been to carry her intact.\n\nYou take your new purse and duffle bag and leave the room. You\u2019ll come back for the sports car later. The only danger of leaving it here is someone stealing the thing, but then it wasn\u2019t really your car to begin with.\n\nBelieving you\u2019ve taken care of everything you need to here, you start up your car and drive off for north of town.\n\nA few hours later and you\u2019re just finishing up digging a good-sized hole in the ground to shove the case in. You really think you were better off doing this in the day time since you neglected to bring a flashlight which would have made digging in the middle of the woods at night a little more difficult.\n\nYou were a little concerned about some random campers stumbling upon you, or maybe some redneck hunters, but so far you haven\u2019t seen a single thing, which is good.\n\nYou look at the luggage case.\n\n\u201cWell Suzy, now is where we part ways. I wish I could say I didn\u2019t want things to be this way, but I\u2019d be lying. You had a better life and I wanted that so I took it. Maybe that makes me a fucking sociopath or evil or something, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. All I can say is I\u2019m going to make the most of it and not waste your life the way I wasted my life.\u201d\n\nYou grab the case and shove it into the hole.\n\n\u201cThanks Suzy and goodbye.\u201d You say and then fill up the hole.\n\nAfter your deed you make the mildly long walk out of the woods and to your car. You throw your shovel in the trunk and sit in the car for a while not doing anything except resting. Digging a hole for a body is some tiring business even if it\u2019s neatly tucked in a case.\n\nYou grab your new phone out of the purse to call your mom so you can let her know you\u2019ll be home soon and that\u2019s when you notice someone else has called while you were out digging.\n\nIt\u2019s your \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d Apparently her name is Heather and she left you a voice message which out of curiosity you listen to.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, I hope you\u2019re having a good time visiting your family. I just wanted to call though and see how you were. I know you haven\u2019t been gone long, but you know I always miss you when you\u2019re not around. Anyway, call me back when you have time. Oh and I sent you some pictures to keep you occupied when you\u2019re alone! (Giggle!)\u201d\n\nYou go through the phone and see that Heather has indeed sent you more than a few pictures. You see a raven haired girl of small physique with lipstick and eye make up wearing lingerie and making sexy poses. You have to admit, she\u2019s actually very pretty in a slightly goth sort of way.\n\n\u201cDamn, maybe I shouldn\u2019t break up with her immediately.\u201d you chuckle.\n\nYou turn the car on and begin making the journey back to your parent\u2019s house. Along the way you think about everything that\u2019s happened this week and how this is just beginning of your new life. You weren\u2019t joking about making the most of it when you said those words out loud in the woods. You meant that, well except you\u2019re not going to be making the most out of her life, you\u2019re going to be making the most out of YOUR life.\n\nWhile the \u201ctransformation\u201d is far from complete, you think the hardest part is over and even if there are challenges or you to overcome, you\u2019ll succeed in surviving and conquering them.\n\nBecause that\u2019s all you\u2019ve done during this Hell week, survived and ultimately conquered it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Mirror rorriM\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\nYour siblings, spouses, children, and you all stand in your mother\u2019s bedroom.

While you might have been more prepared for it this time, it doesn\u2019t make it any less sad. You didn\u2019t even feel this sad when your dad died years ago and you loved him very much, though maybe that\u2019s because you always still had the tainted memory of your crappy alternate one.\n\nYour mother though in both realities was always there for you and you\u2019ve never forgotten that.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve said my goodbyes to everyone\u2026I want\u2026.I want to speak to Suzy\u2026alone\u2026\u201d your mother utters.\n\nEveryone is a little surprised by this unexpected request.

She does however give you the stare of death.\n\nKelly never changes no matter what reality. She always hates you. There actually was a slightly comforting consistency when you first encountered her.\n\n\u201cFine. She\u2019s all yours, just like she always is.\u201d Kelly snaps and storms out the room.\n\nBen exhales and shrugs with a slight widening of his eyes looking at you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026I\u2019m used to it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAlright, everyone come on let\u2019s leave these two alone to talk.\u201d Ben replies.\n\nBen escorts his children out of the room while Julie goes up and gives you a quick hug before following them.\n\nYou kiss and hug your husband and tell your daughter that you\u2019ll see them later.\n\nAfter they leave it\u2019s just you and mom.

I know. I\u2019ve known for a very long time now. A mother always knows her own child.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know how to react. You look down and away from your \u201cmother. You actually feel a little sick and you start to tremble a bit. You have never once in all these years felt bad about what you did, but now you\u2019re not so sure. You begin to sniffle and tears start to form.\n\n\u201cShhhh, Suzy. Save your tears for when I\u2019m truly gone because it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re still my daughter, but I couldn\u2019t go to my grave without letting you know that I knew. I also thought I\u2019d tell you for your sake. Now (cough) I don\u2019t want to know the gruesome details\u2026about HOW this came to be, but if its been weighing on your conscience at all, you didn\u2019t actually replace the Suzy I gave birth to anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is beyond unexpected. How is it possible that she knows all this just on instinct? You look up at your mother.\n\n\u201cMy Suzy\u2026the Suzy I knew as the daughter I gave birth to? Something happened to her a long time ago. (cough cough) Something changed soon after she went to college. I never could place my finger on it, but first time she visited I knew something was different. And it wasn\u2019t just due to experimenting with new ideas and sexuality in college. SHE was different and I KNEW she was. As I said, a mother knows, but the frequent little inconsistencies in her memories and such made it certain. Just as I learned with you.\u201d\n\nYou just continue holding your mother\u2019s hand as she speaks.\n\n\u201cBut what could I do? What could I say? Who would believe such a fantastic tale? Sure this new Suzy was a little more full of herself, but she still loved me just like my Suzy did. I couldn\u2019t lose my baby daughter twice so I never spoke up. Never (cough) dreamed it would happen again though. I suppose in some ways I might have even been glad though. You replaced the one who replaced mine.\u201d\n\nNever did you ever believe that your mother knew. To learn this now is just as overwhelming as when you had to deal with the situation so long ago.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2026why didn\u2019t you say anything before?\u201d you ask looking up.\n\u201cWhy ruin a good relationship? You never disrespected me and treated me kindly. You always visited when you could and you even moved back to town with your family when your father died so you could be closer to me. You obviously loved me very much. Could I really ask for a better daughter?\u201d your mother says with a faint smile.\n\nThe feelings are almost overwhelming you at this point. You\u2019re completely at a loss. At this point your mom gives your hand another squeeze, but weaker this time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my daughter. My baby and I always loved you. Never doubt that.\u201d She says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026(Sob)\u201d you say and attempt to hold it together.\n\nYour mother\u2019s grip is becoming less firm now.\n\n\u201cSoon none of this will matter, but before I go\u2026I want to know a couple things\u2026\u201d your mother says weakly.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cWhat\u2026(cough) was your other mother like?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2026(sniffle) was very much like you. She was kind and was the only one who ever truly cared when I was growing up. I\u2026(sob) was still little when she died\u2026I missed her very much\u2026\u201d you say trying to keep from crying completely.\n\nYour mother nods.\n\n\u201cI see\u2026I suppose\u2026(cough cough) that answer might partially answer my other question then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cHow many other Suzys were there after you?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re silent for a moment.\n\n\u201cThree that I know of. I think you may have even met one of them.\u201d\n\u201cMm\u2026considering you were never replaced\u2026 I suppose\u2026you just wanted this life more than they did then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2026(sob) has been a good life\u2026(sob)\u201d\n\nYour mother pats your hand.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll still have a good life Suzy, even after I\u2019m gone\u2026\u201d she says.\n\nAt this point your mother\u2019s eyes begin to flutter and then shut completely and her breathing becomes shallow.\n\nYou stay until the end and then sadness is completely released. You cry over your loss and head towards the door, not wishing to be in the same room with the empty shell that was your mother any longer.\n\nWhen you exit, your husband immediately sees had distraught you are and goes to comfort you. Your daughter has been visibly crying as well. Ben, says that he\u2019ll start making the arrangements for the funeral, meanwhile Kelly takes it upon herself to call medical personnel.\n\nLater, the drive back home is quieter, with your daughter Sally sleeping in the backseat and your husband Roger just paying attention to the road.\n\nIt\u2019s been an emotional roller coaster for you today. More than you even thought it would be, but you\u2019re sort of glad your mother knew. Somehow her knowing and still loving and accepting you anyway made it just as real as how your reality\u2019s mom felt towards you.\n\nYou also wonder if this means you won\u2019t have to put up with any other reality hopping Suzys any longer. That might be a little too much to hope for though, after all your life is still a good one and you have much to be happy about in the scheme of things. Your mother was right about that.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll continue to fight for it just like you always have because now you truly have a life worth fighting for.\n\n\u201cYou okay over there honey?\u201d Roger asks.\n\u201cYes, well no, but I guess I\u2019m just trying to think about all the good times I had with mom. You know, focus on the positive.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good Suzy. I think that\u2019s a healthy approach.\u201d He replies.\n\nRoger always has been a supportive husband to you. You never would have thought you would have fallen for a soldier type before. You sometimes wonder if you and Roger ever met in another reality.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s odd, but I think I\u2019m also coming up with an idea for a new book. Figure maybe I should re-channel all this negativity into something productive.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? What idea?\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose my mind is still a bit fragmented for a solid idea, but I\u2019m thinking of doing a sequel to Mirrors.\u201d\n\u201cOh, your scifi book about parallel dimensions? That one was pretty popular. I know I certainly liked it better than that one your wrote about that inbred cultist family. That one was a little too gruesome for my tastes.\u201d\n\u201cWell I had to make a dramatic break from my first three books. Up until then, all people thought I could write was lesbian pirate erotica.\u201d\n\u201cHey I liked Treasure Chest. I thought it was a pretty deep love story.\u201d Roger says.\n\u201cOh I know why YOU liked it.\u201d You say chuckling a little bit and allowing yourself to feel a little better.\n\u201cWell okay I liked the obvious too, well anyway do you have any idea on what the new story might involve?\u201d\n\u201cIt will probably just pick up a few years after Mirror left off and I\u2019ll see how it goes from there. Like I said, it\u2019s just in the idea stages now, but whatever I come up with, I\u2019ll definitely be dedicating it in the memory of mom.\u201d\n\u201cWell I think that\u2019s a very good way to honor her. She certainly has contributed to your inspiration.\u201d\n\nYou nod.\n\n\u201cIn more ways than one Roger.

Oh, yeah just someone trying to sell something. They were really persistent.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI can tell, you hardly cut up any of the carrots.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I guess I got caught up in telling them to never call here again. I should have just hung up I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ve gotten directly angry at those telemarketer types too.\u201d\n\u201cHey mom, I\u2019ve got some things I left here that I want to get and I know they\u2019re probably in my room somewhere, you don\u2019t mind if I go take care of that do you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not at all. We can talk later. Let me know if you\u2019re looking for something in particular. I might know where it is.\u201d\n\u201cI will mom.\u201d\n\nYou leave the kitchen and head to your room where you close the door and break down a bit quietly. It isn\u2019t fair, but it is the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cWell, at least I had a few more moments with her, even if she wasn\u2019t my real mom.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nAfter a few moments of being sad, you finally motivate yourself to action.\n\n\u201cWell, I might not be killing her, but I\u2019m not above stealing from the bitch.\u201d You say and grab an old looking duffle bag out of her closet and grab a bunch of her old clothes out of her drawers for yourself.\n\nSure they\u2019re going to be a little tight, but at least you won\u2019t have spend money on clothes for awhile and you\u2019re going to have to make that thousand dollars you still have last until you figure out a way to make a living in this world.\n\nAfter pillaging your alternate\u2019s room, you decide you probably should leave now. No point in drawing this out and it will be easier for you. You imagine that your visit here is probably going to leave some very strange questions for this family when the real Suzy arrives, but you really can\u2019t worry about it. Besides, you\u2019re sure that everything will work itself out anyway. Seems to have so far with this Suzy.\n\nYou head back downstairs and find that dad is back home.\n\n\u201cHey Suzy, where are you heading off to?\u201d dad asks.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m just going to put this in the car and maybe drive around town. Look up some old friends and such. Might not be back until late so I might be knocking on the door waking you up again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not even going to have dinner with us tonight? I thought the whole point of this visit was to see us!\u201d your dad exclaims.\n\u201cIt is, but I still want to visit a few old school friends I haven\u2019t seen in a long time too. I mean we\u2019ll have lots of time tomorrow and the rest of the week!\u201d\n\u201cRest of the week? I thought you had to leave here by Monday.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026well two days is still a lot of time!\u201d you say.\n\u201cI suppose\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026well your mother and I were really happy that you arrived a little earlier than you did since we don\u2019t see you as much anymore and we really wanted to enjoy the time we were getting with you. The extra day was like a bonus.\u201d\n\nYou look a little downtrodden at dad\u2019s disappointed tone.\n\n\u201cBut I guess if you made other plans with other people, I wouldn\u2019t want to stop you.\u201d Your dad remarks and leaves the room.\n\nYou nearly say something, but stop yourself. Instead you just head out the door and to your car.\n\nYou throw the duffle bag in the trunk of your car and get ready to drive off\u2026\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Shit\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as you hang your head down with the key just in the ignition.\n\nYou get back out of the car and head back to the house.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not supposed to arrive until after midnight. Still gives me plenty of time. It\u2019s not going to hurt to have dinner.\u201d You say to yourself and ring the bell.\n\nThe door soon opens and dad answers.\n\n\u201cYou forget something?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah, my manners. You\u2019re right, I should be spending time with you guys. Sorry dad.\u201d You say and give him a hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay honey.\u201d He replies and hugs you back.\n\nYou pass the next few hours chatting with dad. Mostly about mundane matters, which actually don\u2019t involve any more insight into what your alternate life was like here. Doesn\u2019t really matter though, you\u2019re actually just enjoying the conversation. Back in your reality, you don\u2019t think you ever spoke more than a half hour with your father at most.\n\nEventually when dinner is served you sit down to eat with mom too and the conversation continues. This time you do learn a little more about your \u201clife\u201d here and through careful weaving and quick thinking, you manage to navigate through questions you might not otherwise know the answers to.\n\nBy the time dinner is over, you\u2019re enjoying your time with mom and dad so much that you put off leaving immediately after. Instead you play a few board games with them (Which you definitely never did as a child with either of them in your own reality) and continue to have more fun.\n\nEventually the time is getting very late and you do start to get concerned that the other Suzy will arrive earlier than expected. Fortunately mom and dad being creatures of habit tell you they\u2019re turning in for the night and after a few more words, hugs goodnight and mentions of plans for tomorrow, they go to bed.\n\nYou look at the time and see it\u2019s indeed getting up for midnight. You leave the house and get in your car once again.\n\nAs you drive off, you notice you aren\u2019t sad. Well you\u2019re sad that you do have to leave, but you not the emotional wreck you thought you might be. Maybe that little extra time together brought closure of sorts. You certainly are more at peace with it all. You wipe a few tears from your eyes and smile.\n\nThis moment of \u201czen\u201d is suddenly cut short by a car slamming into your driver\u2019s side while rolling through a stop sign due to neither you nor the other driver paying full attention to your surroundings.\n\nThe impact is pretty hard and given you weren\u2019t even wearing your seatbelt at the time makes it worse. Unlike the car crash you had this earlier week, you\u2019re hurt very badly and you even can\u2019t move in your current condition. As you\u2019re lying in your car bleeding, bones broken, having a hard time breathing drifting in and out of consciousness and a piece of twisted metal impaling your side you don\u2019t think a mysterious stranger with magical healing gel is going to fix you this time.\n\nYou also can\u2019t help but think that this is probably the only way this week could have ended for you. Part of you wants to fight, but somehow with the last few good moments you just had with mom and dad make you actually want to let go. Why keep struggling? If you live you live, if not, well at least you had some joy during your last day. More than you might have had otherwise. Maybe you just weren\u2019t meant for this world either.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure how long you lay twisted in the wrecked vehicle for before you hear sirens, but you aren\u2019t even awake long enough to hear the ambulance sirens, let alone before anyone actually comes and helps you. You die of your wounds in the ambulance thanks to the paramedics attending to the other driver first. Who are more than a little freaked out when they first see you and the driver of the other car.\n\nThe funny thing is, you never did see that it was a silver sports car that slammed into you.

Are you upstairs?\u201d you say.\n\u201cSuzy? Yeah! I\u2019m up here! Be careful though, there\u2019s still a bunch of weird shit going on.\u201d\n\nNot terribly descriptive or encouraging. Weird shit could literally be anything, and in this case probably is.\n\nYou head towards the stairs and go up for the first time. As you going up, you have this fear that you\u2019re going to start sinking into them, that doesn\u2019t happen and when you arrive to the top, you find yourself exiting into a corridor that\u2019s laid out very much the same way as the first floor, the only difference is you\u2019re across from another set of stairs on the opposite side.\n\nYou look to your right and hear some noise causing you to ready your bat, though you soon see Jack exiting room of the side rooms.\n\n\u201cSuzy!

Not to mention you\u2019re coming at me with an axe in hand, though I suppose given the shit I\u2019ve already encountered, you probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered to even stop.\u201d You reply lowing the bat.\n\u201cWell, you probably were best to err on the side of caution. I\u2019ve just spent what I believe to be an hour or two looking for you.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI was in your living room downstairs asleep on your couch. Right where you left me last night.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYeah, and you weren\u2019t there when I checked on you later this morning. I called out and looked in every room on the first floor. I heard your voice coming from the second floor so I went up there and that\u2019s when things started getting weird. (Sigh) and I thought this place was done with all that\u2026should have known better I suppose\u2026\u201d\n\nJack trails off, but at this point you\u2019re demanding an answer.\n\n\u201cJack, you\u2019ve saved my life twice, but if I\u2019m going to hang out with you, you better start explaining what the hell\u2019s going on with this place. I\u2019m not sure what weirdness you\u2019ve experienced up here, but what I just experienced downstairs was beyond weird, it was fucking terrifying.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cI know. I know. I should have told you about this place yesterday. Well let\u2019s head into this room and talk about it.\u201d\n\nJack heads into a room down the corridor and to the left. You follow and find that it\u2019s another living area furnished in a similar manner as the one downstairs. Jack was really like consistency. The pair of you sit and after you tell Jack what happened with you downstairs, Jack apologizes that you had to go through it and then tells you a little about what he knows of this place.\n\nJack goes on about how he bought this Gray Building years ago for cheap and figured it would also be good to store all his stuff along with being a place he could live and thus no longer living in his mom\u2019s basement.\n\nHe then mentions he went to check out the place after he bought it and right away he experienced weirdness. He said the first time he opened up the door to the place there was a jungle village inside. He mentions that upon entering the building seemed to whisk him away to this place and his surroundings completely changed.\n\n\u201cCuriosity got the better of me I guess. However it wasn\u2019t just a jungle. I found out later when cannibals were chasing me, that I was on an island made of Styrofoam and held together by hemp rope. Barely escaped.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cWhat?! That\u2019s\u2026incredibly random.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThat was just the beginning. Of course any right thinking person, would have just written this place off, but I couldn\u2019t help but find it fascinating. Of course I found it less fascinating the second time I went in, when I was attacked by these shadow wolf things. Barely survived that too.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell did you keep coming back here?\u201d\n\u201cWell I actually stayed away after the second time. Though after a few months, I felt drawn to the place again. I can\u2019t explain it, but as it turned out third time was the charm, well maybe not entirely, but the place started to become more accommodating. In time, I started to encounter less dangerous shit and the place became more normal, well as normal as it could ever be I suppose. Still, I was never quite willing to go all in and actually live in this place until recently and that\u2019s only because of some positive weirdness that I experienced when in this building a few months ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWell I saw a glimpse of the future and in few days I believe this world as we know it is going to start resembling Road Warrior. Of course even without seeing the future I was listening in on some pretty scary radio broadcasts before the Ground Zero corporation started cracking down and scrambling the airwaves.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you say you saw the future, like how exactly? In your head or what?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was a portal or rather a small window that opened up on the third floor. Happened rather suddenly while I was up there deciding on where I should put more of my stuff a few weeks ago. I saw Security City get nuked. The town looks like it survived, but I saw that overrun by mad people, like rabid or something. Given how the people in town have been acting and the world situation lately, I\u2019d say what I saw was on the mark. It was then, I decide that I might actually be safer in here.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it, by the look of things.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, apparently I was wrong about that. (Sigh) I dunno, I\u2019m sorry I got you involved in all this.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s done now and it seems like I was fucked no matter what this week. So, is there anything we can do? I mean we can\u2019t really stay here I think you\u2019d agree, but if the world is doomed like you\u2019re saying, where could we go?\u201d\n\u201cKnow where there is a fallout shelter?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cYes and no. My older brother made one a long time ago back home, unfortunately its entrance is a bit of a mystery now since he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cThat would mean going back to town anyway and with the National Guard and the rabid there I imagine it\u2019s going to resemble a warzone.\u201d\n\u201cWell there has to be somewhere we can\u2026is that snow?\u201d you say noticing the hallway.\n\nAt this point Jack stands up and you do too, both with your weapons ready as you approach the hallway where white flakes are falling from the ceiling and snow is starting to fill up the hallway. Jack looks to the left and right and then speaks.\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t see anything else out of the ordinary except the snow, but I think we better get the hell out of here and take our chances with the outside world, whatever might happen to it.\u201d Jack exclaims.\n\u201cDon\u2019t need to tell me twice.\u201d You say and the pair of you run as quickly as you can back down to the first floor.\n\nWhen you get to the first floor, you and Jack make your turn towards the large front room and that\u2019s when reality starts warping and you\u2019re getting disoriented again.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Jack says tripping over. You go to help Jack up and that\u2019s when you see them again. Those tentacle things coming at you down the hallway, which is once again increasingly being enveloped in darkness. There\u2019s no magical bald guy around this time to save you either.\n\n\u2018Oh fuck, we need to move!\u201d You say and start running towards the front room. Jack follows along.\n\nWhen you get the front room the lights flicker. Junk is still scattered all over the place and there is also no front door now, but TWO open doors.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Jack exclaims and then the lighting gets even dimmer and soon you\u2019ll be left completely in the dark save for the illumination coming from the open doors.\n\nAt glance, one door is leading to what looks to be a tropical area since you\u2019re seeing vines, trees and such. The other door is leading to a snowy area and you can even feel the cold air whipping in from that one.\n\nAnd those creatures are still in pursuit behind you with darkness ever encroaching. You\u2019re starting to hear them now in your head, howling, chattering, gibbering. It\u2019s madness and you need to leave now.\n\n\u201cShit, my head\u2026\u201d Jack says staggering.\n\u201cCome on! This way!\u201d you say and start heading towards the jungle.\n\u201cWait! That\u2019s a fucking jungle, and I know nothing ever good comes from entering one! Remember my first trip here?\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s either that or the fucking artic and we\u2019re not exactly dressed for that!\u201d you say.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather take my chances with snow than a jungle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pointlessss\u2026.death\u2026isssss everywhere\u2026embrace madnessss and ssssave yourself\u2026 embrace usssssss\u2026\u201d a voice in your head suddenly interjects this is followed by hideous mocking laughter.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re getting resilient or something because you manage to keep it together. Jack isn\u2019t looking as great though which is odd since you figured he\u2019d be used to something like this. He\u2019s having a hard time standing up and you\u2019re having a hard time keeping him from falling.\n\nEither way, you\u2019re making the decision on which way to go.", "action_results": [{"action": "The jungle", "result": "Jack may have had a bad experience with the jungle before, but you\u2019re going to have one infinitely worse you don\u2019t get the hell out of here!\n\nYou don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to end up, but you figure at least there is more chance of survival in the jungle than the tundra or artic or wherever you might end up with the snow door.\n\nSince Jack isn\u2019t exactly in a position to argue, you continue heading towards the jungle.\n\nYou\u2019re almost at the door when everything goes dark.

You look at the trees and ground and for all you know you\u2019re in the Amazon. Certainly feels hot enough and you\u2019re already starting to sweat.\n\n\u201cGoddamn, it\u2019s hot. Jack I\u2019m going to tell you right now, I MIGHT be taking my shirt off at some point and I can only hope you\u2019re a gentleman enough to keep your eyes at least focused on my face when you\u2019re directly speaking with me.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFuck, with the way I feel, I dunno if I\u2019m even up for that sort of stimulation. Besides, I\u2019m going to be keeping an eye on everywhere else given that we\u2019re in a jungle. Ohhh, I really wished you went towards the snow, I got a bad feeling about this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the chances we\u2019re on another Styrofoam island?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I dunno, but it still doesn\u2019t change the fact we\u2019re in a jungle where all manner of animals, bugs and plants can kill you. I guess we better pick a direction and hope we find friendly civilization.\u201d Jack says and gets up.\n\nAs Jack gets up while you look around again and decide on a direction.\n\n\u201cWell at least you\u2019ve still got your axe and I got a bat. The jungle doesn\u2019t look as heavy in that direction I suppose. Guess we\u2019re going that way.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s as good as a direction as any.\u201d Jack replies.\n\nYou and Jack begin your trek through the jungle\u2026\n\nDespite the jungle not being as thick in this direction, it\u2019s still not an easy walk. The only upside, is the canopy of the trees is at least shielding you from the sun directly. You can honestly say you don\u2019t remember when the last time you had to deal with this sort of heat. All that time spent in the cool basement has made you a little less resistant to it you guess.\n\nJack and you continue to keep your eyes and ears open. So far you\u2019ve not seen any signs of civilization, but at one point a small purple furry rodent like animal walks by and you can honestly say even with all the animal and nature shows you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve never seen something like this before. It sees you and squeaks causing you to raise your bat before it runs off.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno, looked like some sort of rat, but purple though.\u201d Jack replies.\n\u201cWell don\u2019t you think a purple rat is a little strange?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell of course I do, but given that this is where the Gray Building sent us, is it really surprising?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean just that though. I mean before I thought that maybe we were at least still on our world. Weird looking purple rat like creatures aren\u2019t exactly native there. Is it possible it sent us to some alien planet?\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, with the Gray Building anything is fucking possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at this moment you lose a little hope. Its one thing to possibly be lost in a jungle on Earth at least there would have been a slim chance of survival if you somehow made it to civilization. The idea of being on some sort of alien planet is a lot more disheartening.\n\n\u201cGreat, we are so fucked.\u201d You say.\n\u201cProbably, but we have to keep moving.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the point? For all we know this whole damn planet is jungle and uninhabited and if it is inhabited I can\u2019t imagine the natives are going to be friendly!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is an alien planet! I mean maybe we got transported back in time to the Mesozoic Era, we don\u2019t know what the hell sort of creatures lived back then or what color they were.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so we\u2019re in the time of dinosaurs? Yeah, don\u2019t think that\u2019s any better.\u201d\n\nJack at this point wipes his face and closes his eyes.\n\n\u201cSuzy, it\u2019s too hot for us to argue, but I told you I didn\u2019t want to go to the jungle anyway!\u201d\n\u201cThere it is. I told you so. Thanks. Real helpful. (Sigh) Okay, look I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this moment you hear a rustling noise and then a whizzing sound is heard just before blood splatters on you.\n\nJack looks down briefly to see the top of a spear through his chest. He coughs up blood and falls to his knees looking at you the whole time.\n\n\u201cOh shit Jack\u2026\u201d you utter and then another spear just narrowly misses your head and hits a nearby tree.\n\nThen you see your assailants coming out of the undergrowth. Several small bipedal lizard like creatures armed with spears. They\u2019re not even as tall as you, but they certainty look more than capable of killing you. They hiss at you and one proceeds to finish off Jack who was already dying at that point.\n\nYou turn and run in the opposite direction ignoring the fact that you\u2019re going to only get yourself further lost in the jungle, you have to escape these things. They screech and they run after you.\n\nAnother spear nearly hits you and despite the very real fear of death you\u2019re experiencing, the only thing going through your mind is how you curse the day you went out to go get a real job. One day you were living comfortably in a basement and now you\u2019re running through a hot ass jungle being chased by fucking lizard aliens.\n\nYou already know this isn\u2019t going to end well for you. You\u2019ve been pushing the odds ever since you left the damn basement, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before those lizards get you and\u2026\n\nSuddenly you feel a sharp bite to the side of your neck. It isn\u2019t a spear. It\u2019s some sort fauna that resembles a snake with legs. You didn\u2019t even see it, but even if you hadn\u2019t been so focused on running, you still wouldn\u2019t have seen it due to its camouflage.\n\nThen before your eyes several of these creatures seemingly blink into existence and they\u2019re all jumping on you and biting. You\u2019ve just run into a nest of whatever these things are and you fall to their onslaught.\n\nThe only upside is their deadly poison kills you before they can start eating you alive.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "The snow", "result": "Really either choice seems pretty shitty, but if Jack feels that strongly about the jungle being worse, you guess you\u2019ll take the snow (and probably freeze to death). You suppose the upside is that there are probably less deadly animals lurking about as there might be in a jungle.\n\n\u201cYou better be right about this Jack.\u201d You say,\n\nYou\u2019re almost at the door when everything goes dark. You feel like those things are almost upon you and you can only hope they stop pursuing you when you go through the door.\n\nWith a boost of energy and a shove, you and Jack both tumble through the opening and into the snowy area. Snow gets all over you both and it\u2019s at that point you notice there are also a lot of trees nearby, so it\u2019s not just endless tundra, which is at least a good sign that you didn\u2019t wind up Antarctica.\n\nYou also recover as quickly as you can, fearing that those creatures are still right behind you, but when you get up you find that not only are they not, but the Gray Building itself is gone. Nothing is behind you save for more snow and trees.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell? Where did it go?\u201d you say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone. We\u2019re some place completely different and who knows where the hell that building is now. Shit\u2026my head is still throbbing and all fucked up. I still don\u2019t feel quite right. Just let me rest here a moment.\u201d Jack says still sitting on the snowy ground.\n\nYou look up and while the clouds are covering the sun, it\u2019s definitely still daytime wherever you are, but with the wind making the cold even worse, you\u2019re going to have to find shelter pretty damn quick and you have no idea which way to go. For all you know you\u2019re in the Canadian wilderness or some other godforsaken place.\n\n\u201cGoddamn, it\u2019s cold.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, we need to get going, even though I\u2019m still feeling woozy. We need to keep an eye out for everything though. I guess we better pick a direction and hope we find friendly civilization.\u201d Jack says and gets up.\n\nAs Jack gets up while you look around again and decide on a direction.\n\n\u201cWell at least you\u2019ve still got your axe and I got a bat. This direction looks as good as any.\u201d You say pointing to the right.\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Jack replies.\n\nYou and Jack begin your trek through the snow\u2026\n\nThe snow actually isn\u2019t really that deep, but it\u2019s deep enough that it\u2019s not pleasant to walk through. The wind eventually dies down a bit which makes things a little better, but not by much. You and Jack are both very cold and periodically you\u2019re rubbing your hands together and blowing on them in a futile effort to keep them warm.\n\n\u201cThis is sucking so much, we\u2019re going to freeze to death out here in the fucking forest.\u201d You say suddenly stopping.\n\u201cWell maybe, but we gotta keep moving. We just gotta stay positive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well as you might already know, positive things haven\u2019t been happening to me lately.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cTrust me, you aren\u2019t only one.\u201d Jack replies.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just really cold, and as brave as I\u2019m trying to be about all this, I feel like I\u2019ve already been pushing my luck all this week and I feel like this is going to be it. Like my dumb luck has run out and I\u2019m really fucking scared of dying.\u201d You say trying to remain calm.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jack replies and puts his hand on your shoulder.\n\nIt isn\u2019t much comfort, but if the end is coming soon, you could have worse company.\n\n\u201cCome on, you\u2019re right, we need to keep moving.\u201d You say and the pair of you continues on.\n\nA few moments later, you feel like your fingers and toes have gone numb and you\u2019re even starting to get a little sleepy. Day is starting to end and night will be beginning soon.\n\nJust when you believe it\u2019s starting to look even worse than ever, you and Jack notice some smoke rising in the distance up ahead, and as they say where there is smoke there is fire. (Hopefully)\n\nYou and Jack both quicken your pace as much as you can and eventually you reach the edge of the ground, which starts sloping downward from your location. In the short distance from that you see a small log cabin with smoke coming from it.\n\nSalvation, but somehow you doubt if it\u2019s going to be easy.\n\n\u201cYou know there are going to be people living there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, but I mean come on, we\u2019re freezing to death, surely they\u2019ll help us. At best they\u2019ll let us warm up before giving us directions to the next nearest town.\u201d\n\u201cJack, your optimism would actually be very charming if we weren\u2019t in the situation we\u2019re currently in.\u201d you say.\n\u201cWell hopefully you\u2019ll better appreciate it when we\u2019re nice and warm. Come on.\u201d Jack says.\n\nYou and Jack carefully make your way down the slope and soon you\u2019re at the cabin. You see piles of logs stacked nearby, along with some barrels. The cabin doesn\u2019t have any windows or at least none on the sides that you\u2019ve seen.\n\n\u201cOkay, so how are we doing this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll knock.\u201d Jack says.\n\nJack bangs on the door a couple times.\n\n\u201cHello? Anyone in there? We\u2019re freezing and we need help. Hello?\u201d he says.\n\nThere is no answer. You don\u2019t even hear any noise.\n\n\u201cMaybe nobody is home after all.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s smoke coming from the chimney, obviously there\u2019s probably a fire going on in there.\u201d Jack replies.\n\u201cWell, maybe they\u2019re out hunting or something and there\u2019s a scared kid in there that was told not to open the door to strangers. See if the door is unlocked.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWait a minute, didn\u2019t you just say there might be a scared kid in there?\u201d\n\u201cYeah and if there is, he\u2019s still going to be scared whether we\u2019re inside or outside. We need to get in there Jack, we can deal with the consequences later!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nJack exhales.\n\n\u201cWell okay\u2026\u201d Jack says as he goes for the handle.\n\nSurprisingly it opens and when Jack peers into the dimly lit cabin, he sees absolutely no one inside.\n\n\u201cThis place is empty.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cGood, now let\u2019s get to that damn fire!\u201d you say and push past Jack.\n\nYou warm up by the fireplace while Jack shuts the door and locks it with a large piece of wood across it. He soon joins and sits down right next to you.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Jack says when he thinks he\u2019s too close to you, but you stop him from moving over.\n\u201cJack, I think we\u2019re at that point in our relationship that under normal circumstances, we\u2019d probably be dating already. You\u2019re fine, in fact why don\u2019t you just hold me. I could use the extra warmth.\u201d\n\nJack complies with your request and you\u2019re feeling a little warmer already. As you still trying to enjoy the warmth, Jack is still looking around the room a bit from his position.\n\n\u201cThis is strange.\u201d Jack mentions.\n\u201cReally? I thought this was probably the least strange thing we\u2019ve done since we met.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean this cabin, something seems very, I dunno, medieval.\u201d\n\u201cWell it is a log cabin in the middle of the woods, it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s going to have the amenities of the modern world.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but have you noticed the decorations? A shield and a sword are hanging over on that wall along with a small banner of some sort. Over there in that corner is a set of spears. There also a lot of furs just laying around.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the guy that lives here is a historical buff on top of being a hunter. You know, trying to live the way they did back in the old days.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve never seen something like that either. Look.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s just a deer\u2019s head\u2026oh what the hell? That\u2019s fucking hideous looking.\u201d You say just noticing the head of some very furry creature with far too many teeth mounted on the wall.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like anything you\u2019ve ever seen on those nature or animal shows. You shiver a bit looking at the damn thing causing Jack to give you a bit of a squeeze.\n\n\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t want to look at that thing. What is it?\u201d you say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, I dunno. I mean a lot of this shit looks familiar, but seeing something like makes me less sure.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I mean I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re even on our world.\u201d\n\nIn all the worrying about freezing to death, you suppose it never occurred that might not actually be on Earth.\n\n\u201cYou think the Gray Building sent us to a different dimension or something?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea, but with that thing it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. I mean you told me yourself you experienced reality weirdness when you were speaking with that bald guy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true\u2026shit. We might be in some real trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWell, in the chance that we are on another world, I\u2019d say we can at least look on the bright side that we aren\u2019t going to get nuked any time soon.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, always looking on the bright side.\u201d\n\u201cDid it charm you this time?\u201d\n\u201cA little bit.\u201d You say with a smile.\n\nAfter warming up completely, you and Jack explore the cabin a little more in detail, which doesn\u2019t take too long considering it\u2019s not excessively big. Some of that exploration includes raiding the foodstuff stored in the cabinets and the actual stew that\u2019s in the hanging pot over the fire. All you find to drink is water and some sort of sweet alcohol. Jack says that\u2019s probably mead.\n\nOne of the more important things you find is a small pouch of coins. A few are gold, some are silver and a lot of them are copper. You also find a few books, but they\u2019re in some sort of language you don\u2019t understand.\n\nThe last thing you discover is a trap door near the bed to a small root cellar where there is more food and water stored. Looks like you might be okay if you have to stay here awhile at least.\n\nThe only short term major concern is a toilet at which point Jack points that while it\u2019s possible there is an outhouse you missed somewhere in the area, you both might have to be roughing that in the cold air of nature. You\u2019re not looking forward to either possibility.\n\nYou remark about how this place reminds you of something from a video game you played on your computer, which only cements Jack\u2019s view that you\u2019re possibly not on your world any longer, or at best you\u2019ve been transported back in time on earth to who knows where. That thing\u2019s head on the wall seems to favor the former though.\n\nEventually though as the night moves on, you start to get tired again, but this time you\u2019re not in danger of dying of hypothermia. It\u2019s soon pointed out that there is only one bed.\n\n\u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll let you take the bed.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cActually I want to sleep by the fire, I\u2019m just going to grab some more of those furs to sleep on. You can take the bed, or if you really want to, sleep with me by the fire.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s no choice at all, of course I\u2019m going to sleep with you by the fire.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cFine with me, as long as you know I\u2019m just using you for your warm body.\u201d You reply with a smile.\n\u201cWell, just respect me in the morning.\u201d Jack smiles back.\n\u201cUm, speaking of that. Do you think we should be worried that the owner will be coming back at some point?\u201d\n\u201cProbably, but if someone comes knocking on the door, it isn\u2019t like we\u2019re weaponless.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, okay let\u2019s try to get some rest and figure out what we\u2019re going to do tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou and Jack lay down several furs on the floor and settle in to sleep. Despite this situation not exactly being the best, you both at least enjoy the closeness of each other.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up feeling slightly colder than you did last night, though it\u2019s probably because the fire has died down a little and Jack is no longer spooning you. A quick look around though shows that he\u2019s still here. He notices that you\u2019re up.\n\n\u201cWell good morning sunshine.\u201d He says sitting at a table with a candle burning.\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d you ask, not thinking.\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s still morning, maybe the afternoon. In any case it\u2019s daytime the last time I looked outside.\u201d\n\u201cOh right. No modern luxuries. Is that one of those books we found yesterday?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yeah. I was trying to read or at least understand any of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou a linguist?\u201d\n\u201cEh, not really. I mean I have studied a few languages from time to time for my own reasons and in a couple cases thanks to the Gray Building weirdness I had to learn some new ones, but it isn\u2019t like I had any formal training on the matter.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand any of it?\u201d\n\u201cNot excessively so, but I only really started. I get the impression whoever lives here is a fur trader. Some of this book isn\u2019t doesn\u2019t really consist of words as it\u2019s a list of numerical symbols and totals. Fortunately those are universal. It would also explain the large amounts of furs piled up and this\u2026\u201d Jack says picking up the pouch of coins. \u201c\u2026I would imagine is their life savings.\u201d\n\u201cSo you still think we\u2019re in a different world?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. As I mentioned I\u2019ve looked outside while you were asleep, and wandered the area a bit. Not too far, but I didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary save for trees, snow and a few white rabbits bouncing around. I mean that ugly head on the wall is the only thing I\u2019ve seen so far that\u2019s out of the ordinary. I will say that the presence of books at least shows writing and probably literature exists. The coins imply some sort of economy system. So civilization here exists, but of course who knows what said civilization is like.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you thought it was a medieval one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m still holding on to that belief, of course it\u2019s possible that maybe we\u2019re just in a less advanced area. For all we know there are people whizzing around in jetpacks elsewhere.\u201d Jack says and then snaps his fingers. \u201cOh I did see an outhouse. It\u2019s not excessively far; we just never saw it yesterday due to the direction we came from. Well that and paying more attention to wanting to get into this cabin. You\u2019ll happy to know it\u2019s not even a disgusting diarrhea sprayed mess or overly foul smelling. The cold climate probably helps on that aspect. There\u2019s even a roll of paper in there. Um, it\u2019s not exactly the softest stuff though, and you\u2019ll have to clean your hands in the snow.\u201d\n\u201cLovely. Definitely not looking forward to the experience. So you see anything else of note on your outdoor adventures?\u201d\n\u201cI noticed foot prints going from this cabin and heading towards the east. I imagine they\u2019re from the boots of the person who lives here. I\u2019ve seen the same foot prints all over this immediate area, but those were going somewhere with a purpose rather than milling about taking care of every day chores around here I imagine.\u201d\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re tracker too huh? You really do know a little bit of everything.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a tracker, I\u2019m just sort of making guesses in the scheme of things. I just saw the prints in the snow and made the conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the person living here is coming back?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. I mean it\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m wondering if this place was abandoned. Seems like the door would have been locked. Of course the door can only be barred from the inside, so maybe that\u2019s unavoidable and there generally aren\u2019t many people wandering around here to worry about locks. Still, it seems like they would have hidden their pouch of coins better or even taken them with them.\n\nYou nod and there is a silent pause in the conversation.\n\nYou look back at the fire and Jack goes back to looking at the book. Probably the pair of you are wondering what the hell you\u2019re going to do now. At least you are. Jack seems like he\u2019s trying his hardest to make sense of everything and that\u2019s certainly a good thing. You can\u2019t help but think maybe you\u2019re not pulling your weight as much as you can though, it\u2019s just you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019ve ever been in a situation like this before.\n\nSo far you\u2019ve just been trying to make the concentrated effort of not falling apart and giving in to despair because you get the impression no matter what happens, from here on out your life is going to be very different.\n\n\u201cI know how to sew.\u201d You suddenly blurt out.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack responds.\n\u201cI know how to sew, I mean I haven\u2019t done it ever since my mother died, but you never forget something like that completely I suppose. My mother was the one who taught me, which is why I just sort of lost interest in it when she died.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s an interesting little fact you never told me about yourself when you were talking about your family before. What made you bring it up?\u201d\n\u201cOur situation I suppose. I mean I suppose at some point we\u2019re going to need new clothes. I\u2019ve never sewn furs together, but I suppose I\u2019ll figure it out. I guess I just want to let you know I\u2019m not completely useless and I will be contributing to our survival out here. I mean I\u2019ll chop wood and learn to hunt and whatever else we need to do together.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you\u2019re stressing about this too much. I mean yes, this situation isn\u2019t the best, but trust me I\u2019m just as worried if I\u2019M going to be useful at all in this situation. I mean it\u2019s only thanks to all the past weirdness I had to deal with due to that Gray Building that I even have some of the basic knowledge I have of various things and a good portion of that probably isn\u2019t even going to be useful here.\u201d\n\nJack gets up and goes over to sit with you and he takes your hand.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done. We\u2019re both a pair of basement dwellers and neither one of us was truly prepared for this, but we\u2019re still going to get through it. I mean I like to think I\u2019m a survivor on some level. And you, well I think you\u2019ve more than proven to be one. I know you think it\u2019s all just been luck or coincidence in that regard, but hell, maybe there\u2019s a reason. Maybe there\u2019s a reason for all this.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so? You believe that all this is part of some plan?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Maybe it\u2019s just a bunch of shit that happened. Still doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to get through this.\u201d\n\nYou look into Jack\u2019s eyes and you take the initiative and kiss him full on the mouth. He reciprocates your affection, but you\u2019re getting the strong impression that you might be the experienced one here.\n\nAnd then something urgent breaks up the moment.\n\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat? Did I do something wrong?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cNo. That thing that I wasn\u2019t looking forward to has finally arrived.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026Oh. That. Um, well did you want me to come with you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to watch me go to the bathroom? Freak.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I meant did you want me to come with you to show you the way or extra protection.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you meant, just joking. Yeah, I suppose you should come with me so you can at least show me where it is. Knowing me, I\u2019d end up getting lost on the way there. Well alright come on, let\u2019s go get this over with.\u201d You say getting up.\n\nRemembering how cold it is out there, you grab a couple of the furs to wrap around you so you\u2019re at least better protected this time. You go to grab your bat, but then you think if you shouldn\u2019t take one of those spears instead.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the bat", "result": "You\u2019ve never used a spear before, so you aren\u2019t even sure if you\u2019d use something like that effectively. Better to stick with something you\u2019re used to.\n\nJack puts on one of the furs as well and grabs his axe and the pair of you are out the door. The sun shines down and you feel the cold wind blow.\n\n\u201cShit, even with these furs on I forgot how cold it was.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get another big fire started when we get back.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it, so which way?\u201d\n\u201cOh to the left and then past some trees, it\u2019s not hard to find.\u201d\n\nYou and Jack make your way to the infamous outhouse. You both look around periodically, but see nothing dangerous.\n\nEventually you get to your goal and it looks exactly like you thought it would.\n\n\u201cWell this is it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out here. Keeping a look out.\u201d Jack responds.\n\nYou enter the outhouse and endure the unavoidable. Thankfully Jack makes no attempt to speak to you while you\u2019re inside.\n\nEventually you come out and start putting your hands in the snow. Jack watches you and then goes back to looking around.\n\n\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought, I\u2019m still missing modern plumbing though. Wish we had soap too.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI guess if you want to sanitize your hands even more I suppose you could pour some of that mead we have at the cabin on them.\u201d\n\u201cWill that work?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s got alcohol in it, I assume it can\u2019t hurt. You ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you see anything out here?\u201d\n\u201cNah, just a few more of those white rabbits I always see hopping around.\u201d\n\nAs you and Jack make your way back to the cabin, you and he speak on if either one of you knows anything about hunting. You of course know nothing, Jack says he\u2019s not much better, though he thinks maybe you both could start making simple traps or something, especially given that there are obviously rabbits around here to be caught.\n\n\u201cWish we had the Internet so we could at least look all this shit up. God, I really miss the Internet\u2026I think this is the longest I\u2019ve been without it and I suppose those days are over as well.\u201d You say as you approach the cabin.\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know. We\u2019re still just stuck out here in the wilderness, like I said, maybe there is Internet and hover cars somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cLove that optimism Jack\u2026\u201d you say chuckling and heading towards the door.\n\u201cHey Suzy, wait is that blood in the snow?\u201d\n\nYou and Jack both stop a few feet away from the cabin, you\u2019re still closest to the door, which suddenly swings open.\n\nBefore you, you see a man with a good amount of facial hair and wearing several furs and clothing much more suited for this sort of weather.\n\nHe\u2019s not completely standing upright, but is in a somewhat stooped position as if wounded which judging from the blood in the snow is probably the case. While it\u2019s difficult to tell his facial expression due to the hair, his eyes are wide as if he\u2019s surprised, desperate or possibly even afraid. Maybe a mixture of all three.\n\nThe major thing you see however is the crossbow he\u2019s holding and pointing at you and Jack.\n\nThe man shouts something at you in a language you don\u2019t understand and before you can duck or get out of the way he fires a bolt and at this range his aim is still sound.

Why? You taking one of those instead of the bat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was remembering something I watched once talking about how the spear was an easy weapon to learn how to use even for someone completely unskilled which is why it was used so much in ancient and medieval wars amongst infantry. I\u2019m just thinking I\u2019d probably want something like that with me instead of a bat if we encounter a bear or something I want to keep at a distance.\u201d\n\nJack looks at you a bit impressed.\n\n\u201cWell, look at you. Suzy, warrior princess over here. You said you didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d Jack says smiling.\n\nYou take the spear and then look over at the shield.\n\n\u201cJack, help me get that shield down from the wall.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack responds.\n\u201cI want to take the shield with me too.\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you\u2019re just going to the bathroom, not to war!\u201d\n\u201cHey you said it yourself, we still don\u2019t know what this place is all about and I want to feel as secure as possible, so if that means carrying around a shield, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026alright\u2026\u201d Jack says and then proceeds to grab the circular shield down from the wall and then hands it to you.\n\nThe shield isn\u2019t light and is made of strong thick wood; you definitely feel the weight just holding the thing.\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want the sword too?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cNah, I think this is all I can carry. The shield is definitely heavier than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need that.\u201d Jack says wrapping a fur around himself and grabbing the axe he brought with him from the Gray Building.\n\u201cAnd like I said, it makes me feel better.

When Jack\u2019s not looking around, he\u2019s studying you.\n\n\u201cSo you ready to fight the Persians?\u201d Jack asks with a smirk.\n\u201cI dunno, but I have to say I do feel rather empowered.\u201d You reply.\n\nEventually you get to your goal and it looks exactly like you thought it would.\n\n\u201cWell this is it.\u201d You say unenthusiastically.\n\u201cYour shield is going to be kind of bulky, leave it out here with me. Unless you plan on getting attacked from below and if that\u2019s the case, a shield isn\u2019t going to help.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, now I\u2019m going to be worrying about something lurking down there and reaching up to grab me. Thanks a lot!\u201d you say and give the shield to Jack.\n\nYou enter the outhouse and endure the unavoidable. Thankfully Jack makes no attempt to speak or make jokes to you while you\u2019re inside.\n\nEventually you come out and start putting your hands in the snow.

You charge forward with the shield up and the spear out. You even start screaming like you\u2019re in an action movie.\n\nYour charge is stopped when you hit the man full on. The spear sinks into his body and he cries out in pain dropping the crossbow. You attempt to pull the spear as hard as you can back out, but it isn\u2019t easy because the man keeps you from doing so by gripping the top of the shaft and the man still has enough strength to grab the knife on his side with his other hand.\n\nFortunately he can\u2019t quite reach you and swings helplessly with one hand. Since you can\u2019t pull the spear out, you instead start wiggling it to the left and right no doubt adding to the pain as well as internal organ damage. The man once again screams in agony and lets go of the spear allowing you to pull it out. He falls to the floor.\n\nJack who was having difficulty in getting around you before finally succeeds so he can get in closer to swing his axe down at the man on the floor.\n\n\u201cSuzy, hang on I can\u2026agh!\u201d Jack exclaims as the man desperately slashes at the closest leg to him with his knife, which happened to be Jack\u2019s. This causes Jack to reel back and nearly stumble into the fireplace. Fortunately he only falls into a small pile of logs for the fireplace.\n\nYou press your advantage by stepping up and attempting to plunge the spear into the man\u2019s neck, but he manages to dodge and you only hit the floor. He grabs the shaft of the spear again in an attempt to keep you from using it. He\u2019s got a weak one-handed grasp though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Pull the spear", "result": "With as much strength as you can, you pull the spear from the man\u2019s grasp.

Jack falls to the floor, dropping his axe and stopped from being able to help you.\n\nMeanwhile you\u2019re attempting to recover from your wounded foot, and sit up just in time to see the man stagger and stumble over to pick up the spear. Upon seeing how severely wounded Jack is, and your own injury you begin to panic. Not enough to run, but also not enough to make the best decisions.\n\nYou limp over to the man in an attempt to cave his head in with the shield, but thanks to your foot, you aren\u2019t really the fastest. The man dodges your attempt by falling back to the floor, but with the spear now in his hand, from his prone position he manages to thrust it into your side.\n\nYou cry out and fall. The agony of your wounds is overwhelming now and you can barely stand it.

He doesn\u2019t even have the energy to do anything with his other hand holding the knife.\n\nYou quickly lift the spear from its original position and looking directly into his eyes, you thrust it directly into his throat and twist.\n\nThe man makes sickening gurgling sounds as blood comes from his mouth and neck, his eyes bulge and his body convulses for a few seconds and then stops.\n\nMeanwhile, you\u2019re breathing heavily and just staring at the body.\n\n\u201cSuzy? Suzy? You alright?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah\u2026I just\u2026I just killed a man. Never did that before\u2026well not directly I suppose.\u201d You say and step down from the shield and the dead man\u2019s body.\n\nJack limps over to close the door and then over to you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you sure you\u2019ve never fought before? I mean it all happened so fast, but you seemed to just suddenly go into some sort of warrior mode.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Something just clicked inside my head. Can\u2019t explain it myself either. Maybe it was just a fight or flight response and I\u2019ve been sick of running lately. This guy was trying to kill us and I had no choice but to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cWell it was certainly one of those situations.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I guess. Is your leg okay?\u201d you say moving your shield off the body.\n\u201cYeah, It\u2019s superficial, I guess I better clean it out with alcohol and wrap it up though. I think I saw a roll of linen wrap in one of those drawers.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like that\u2019s what this guy was attempting to do too because the wrap you mentioned is right there on the table along with an open jar and a big pouch. This guy was obviously already hurt when we found him. Look there.\u201d You say and point at the man who you now notice has an ugly gash on his arm that looks like some green stuff was smeared on it. You lift up a few more of the furs on his body and notice another wound on his side as well. You weren\u2019t responsible for either of those.\n\nJack goes over to get the wrap and inspect the open jar.\n\n\u201cI think this might be some sort of ointment. Smells awful and has the same green color on his wounded arm. This pouch looks like it has more of his items. I\u2019m going to take a look.\u201d Jack says.\n\nWhile Jack goes through the dead man\u2019s bag, you decide to directly search the body. You don\u2019t find anything though except a half full quiver of crossbow bolts and his fur clothing, which you start taking off of him.\n\n\u201cSuzy, what are you doing?\u201d Jack asks when he sees you stripping the dead man.\n\u201cI\u2019m looting his corpse. So far this is the only set of proper clothing we have for this sort of weather. Might as well keep some of it, we can always get the blood out and I can sew up the holes later. The boots alone should be worth keeping.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026well I suppose you\u2019re right. You need any help?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cNah, I got it. Just patch up your leg.\u201d You say.\n\nWhile Jack does just that, you proceed with your task. By the time you get the man down to his raggedy loincloth, you temporarily stop to just look at the body, exhale and rub your hand over your face.\n\n\u201cNot a pretty sight from here either.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s the fact that I\u2019ve just realized that I\u2019ve been sitting here stealing a dead man\u2019s clothes and I don\u2019t feel bad about it. And even coming to that conclusion, I STILL don\u2019t feel bad about it. It\u2019s like nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWell I admit, this is sort of fucked up, but he did attack us first.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing is though is we\u2019re the trespassers. I mean he owned this place. Probably built it with his own fucking hands. From his perspective and any right thinking person\u2019s, he had the damn right to try to kill us. I know if someone invaded my home I wouldn\u2019t like it. We just stumbled in and started going through his shit and stealing it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWe needed to survive.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not debating that. I just\u2026well\u2026does this make us evil? Because if it does, I have to say, I\u2019m perfectly fine with that and that\u2019s probably a scariest thing I\u2019ve just learned about myself this week and the funniest too, because I can also honestly say killing this guy was one of the highest points of motivation I\u2019ve ever had and that includes all the times I was running for my life this week and especially attempting to get a job in a shitty comic shop.\u201d you say.\n\nJack doesn\u2019t respond, he just sort of looks down and then away, going back to wrapping his leg.\n\nYou stand up and grab the man by his feet.\n\n\u201cJack can you get the door?\u201d you say.\n\u201cYeah, and don\u2019t try to drag him by yourself, I\u2019ll help.\u201d Jack replies as he heads over to the door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I got it. Just get that fire going while I\u2019m dragging his body out into the wilderness.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy, we\u2019re in this together. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Grab the other leg after you open the door.\u201d You respond.\n\nYou and Jack drag the body into the wilderness. You make a mention that maybe you should bury it at some point, but as long as it\u2019s immediately out of sight and away from the cabin, it\u2019s good enough where it is.\n\nThe pair of you then quickly make your way back hoping nobody else has shown up at your home. Which is certainly what it is now considering you just killed the owner. You\u2019re still feeling a bit numb about that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re back inside the cabin, Jack speaks up again.\n\n\u201cJust for the record, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re evil.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cWell evil people don\u2019t tend to think they are.\u201d You answer with a minor chuckle.\n\u201cI dunno about that, there are tons of evil bastards that revel in their evilness. I mean I\u2019ll admit I feel a little bad about what we did, but I just don\u2019t want you to beat yourself up about what happened too much. It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. That\u2019s sort of my point and why I was wondering if I was evil in the first place, but you\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t something to brag about, but it\u2019s done and there\u2019s no point in worrying about it.\u201d\n\nYou close the door and bar it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little tired. I\u2019m going to go lay down on the bed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get this fire going like I planned to do before all this happened. I\u2019ll clean up some of the mess around here too.\u201d Jack replies.\n\nYou get on the simple bed, which is basically made up of straw, animal skin and furs. It\u2019s not a sofa, but it\u2019s all the comfort you\u2019re going to have in the near future.\n\nEven though you already talked about this with Jack, you still can\u2019t help but go back to it. You start wondering if there is something genetically wrong inside your head and part of you takes after your uncle Ed, or maybe if when you went through all that shit in the Gray Building you \u201clost\u201d part of yourself somehow.\n\nThen you start wondering if maybe it was just a desperate situation and in such times, people do desperate things even if they normally wouldn\u2019t have done so. Like Jack said, you are trying to survive and like you said, that man was going to kill you and you had to prevent that from happening.\n\nIt\u2019s as good as a rationalization as any. Jack seems to be fine with it and you are too.\n\nYou sit up slightly from your position and watch Jack clean up the place and stoke the fire. It\u2019s weird to think you met this guy in a comic shop and here you are with him who knows where.\n\nYou\u2019ve had more adventures with him this week than you ever had with anyone else. And that includes Bobby because it wasn\u2019t like the two of you ever went anywhere.\n\nAs you think on these things, your hands start to wander and you feel a lump in your pocket which you forgot being there. You half expect it to be your dead cell phone, but what it is, is the thousand dollars and the car keys Jack gave you.\n\n\u201cHeh, I forgot these were even in my pocket. Guess we have another reminder of the old world.\u201d You say jingling the keys a bit at Jack.\n\u201cSadly, I doubt if all that cash is going to be useful here, well except for kindling.\u201d Jack replies\n\u201cWell at least the keys can be a reminder of your first gift ever to me.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cGreat. My first gift to you was a car and a thousand dollars. That\u2019s going to be tough to top now.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cActually I got an idea of how you might be able to match it. Jack, stop cleaning up, I want you over here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just remembering earlier that we were in middle of something, and I\u2019m thinking we need to get back to that again.\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2026oh\u2026\u201d Jack says suddenly getting it when you start taking your clothes off.\n\u201cWell, what are you waiting for? Get your clothes off.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy, we don\u2019t need to do this you know. I\u2019m perfectly fine waiting.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not. It\u2019s been a while and I haven\u2019t even been able to set time aside for splittin\u2019 the kitten so this is as much for me as it is for you. Besides, after surviving the week we\u2019ve both had, I think we should have a little celebration don\u2019t you think? What the fuck else do we have to do?\u201d you say.\n\nJack doesn\u2019t respond, he just starts taking his clothes off a bit shyly. It\u2019s at that moment you remember the fact that he seemed a little inexperienced when you were kissing him earlier.\n\n\u201cJack, you don\u2019t need to be nervous around me. We can start off slow if we need to and I\u2019m not going to judge. It\u2019s just me and you okay? Just like it\u2019s been all this week.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I just\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know and it\u2019s fine, just come over to me.\u201d You say reassuringly.\n\nIt isn\u2019t long before Jack and you are both on the bed naked. Just as you said, you take it a bit slow with him. Feels a little weird being the \u201caggressive\u201d one, but there certainly is a part of you that\u2019s enjoying the role.\n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of it, when Jack says something that makes things slightly odd.\n\n\u201cI love you Suzy.\u201d He says.\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2026 love you Jack\u2026\u201d you answer back.\n\nWell, maybe it isn\u2019t TOO odd, considering you\u2019re probably the only girl Jack has ever been with and spent any long amount of time with too.\n\nIn fact you sort of wonder why you even hesitated to say it back, after all, you are fond of him and you\u2019ve had a budding relationship with Jack all this week. You just suppose that \u201clove\u201d hasn\u2019t really been in your mind since you broke up with Bobby.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a nice feeling after all the shit that\u2019s happened this week.\n\nAfterwards, you and Jack hold each other and generally talk about shit that doesn\u2019t pertain to your immediate situation. There is much that will have to be done, but for now the pair of you are enjoying shutting out the outside world.\n\nJust like when you two were living in the basement.\n\nDay eventually becomes night and the pair of you turn in a little earlier than usual.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou groggily wake up and see Jack over at the table like he was the last time you woke up in this place. He looks like he\u2019s studying a piece of paper and doesn\u2019t notice you waken immediately this time.\n\nAfter sitting up, you call out to him.\n\n\u201cHey, cunninglinguist whatcha discover today?\u201d you ask rubbing your eyes.\n\u201cOh hey, you\u2019re up. Just looking at this parchment that was in this large pouch here. It\u2019s a crude map from what I can tell.\u201d\n\u201cA map? Well that\u2019s convenient. Anything good?\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know all the symbols obviously, but I THINK this might lead to a couple towns. Some of these look like roads, I don\u2019t know though until we do some exploring.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d You exclaim.\n\u201cWhat right now?\u201d\n\u201cSure. I mean we\u2019re going to have to at some point, might well start getting some of this shit out of the way.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, guess we better get dressed then.\u201d\n\nYou nod and start grabbing your clothing. As much is you might like the furry boots, They\u2019re a little big on you. They\u2019re actually a little big on Jack too, but they at least fit him better, so he gets them. You both of you put on furs much like you did yesterday, then you grab your spear and shield.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take that other spear. Seems like it worked for you yesterday.\u201d Jack mentions.\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to take the crossbow?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIf I knew how to use one properly, sure I\u2019d take it. But I think I\u2019m going to have to practice with something like that first. Seems slow to load and it won\u2019t do you any good if you\u2019re in trouble and I can\u2019t use it effectively. At least with this spear I can help you directly.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, good idea.\u201d\n\nAfter hiding a few of your more valuable items (Like your only pouch of coins) you both leave the cabin.\n\n\u201cSo which way should we go?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m thinking we should follow the tracks of the guy who lived here. They were going to the right before he came back. According to the map, there is a town in this direction. Or at least I think there is, guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nYou and Jack head to the right. The occasional blood in the snow makes it pretty easy to follow them though the tracks have been partially covered by snow or stomped over already.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking it was sort of a good thing that guy was wounded yesterday. He wasn\u2019t exactly easy to put down. I can\u2019t imagine the fight he would have put up if he had been at full strength.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cYeah, but now I\u2019m wondering what the hell he was fighting before he met us and how many.\u201d You respond.\n\nEventually after a bit of traveling, you and Jack see something lying in the snow. It looks very large too. The pair of you cautiously approach.\n\nWhen you reach the body, you notice that it\u2019s a massive\u2026 creature with grayish blue skin and tusk like teeth. It\u2019s dressed in the barest of fur clothing and has several crossbow bolts and arrows in its body and face. You also see signs of deep cuts across its body. Next to its body is a large club, which resembles more of a broken tree branch rather than a proper weapon. However it would certainly kill someone if swung at them and judging by how massive this creature\u2019s muscles are, it looks more than capable of smashing someone\u2019s head in even without a club. The club has signs of blood on it.\n\n\u201cHoly shit. What the fuck\u2026\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI think we just found what that guy was running from or limping away from rather. Must\u2019ve been quite the fight.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI think there is more stuff up ahead, well more blood anyway.\u201d\n\nYou and Jack leave the creature\u2019s body behind and follow the rest of the blood trail noting a broken sword along the way.\n\nYou soon find a second body, but this one looks human, or at least you guess it was, since the half of the head is caved in. Blood and brains are scattered about the snow. It\u2019s a pretty grisly sight, but you\u2019re long since desensitized by now.\n\nYou see a bow nearby, but the body still clutches a bloody dagger in its hand. A fur hat also sits several paces away. You assume it probably was knocked off during the fight.\n\n\u201cI guess this was his friend\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking it could have even been his girlfriend, smaller frame, even with the furs on I can see the chest is bigger. Long hair and from what I can tell of what\u2019s left of the face, it looks slightly female\u2026is that ear pointed?\u201d you say.\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026that ear is definitely pointed.\u201d Jack says looking\n\u201cWhat the hell, did we step into some sort of fantasy world?\u201d\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine. Told you that Gray Building could have sent us any fucking where.\u201d\n\nYou exhale, not quite knowing what to make of all this.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep going a bit further.\u201d You say.\n\nJack and you press on, but you don\u2019t find any more signs of battle. You do eventually find that the wilderness ends and the edge of a road begins however. Sort of hard to tell due to the snow, but there definitely is a road here. Across the road are more trees. Sort of reminds you home that way.\n\n\u201cWell I guess this is one of the roads, which means I guess I got something on this map correct at least. Looks like if we go south, we\u2019ll hit the closest town. Still looks quite the like a walk though.\u201d Jack responds.\n\u201cMaybe we should cut the exploration trip a little short for today. Let\u2019s gather all that useful stuff from that battle scene and take it back to the cabin. We can certainly use some of it. The boots on that girl look like they would be more likely to fit me anyway and wearing something like those would be a hell of a lot more pleasant for walking around in.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\n\nYou and Jack return to the battle scene and begin looting the dead girl first. Along with the furs and her weapons, you also find a nearly empty quiver of arrows and a small pouch similar to the one that the man had. You take a quick look inside and see several items for you to inspect when you\u2019re in the comfort of your much warmer cabin.\n\nWhen you and Jack are loaded up, you and he leave the dead woman mostly naked in the snow, much like you left the man and make your way back.\n\nUpon getting back to the body of the monster you attempt to pull out some of the bolts and arrows lodged in its body, but some are either partially broken off inside or just sunk in too deep and you\u2019re not willing to make the effort to hang around and pull out every single one. The monster itself wasn\u2019t carrying anything save for it\u2019s minimalistic fur cloth around it\u2019s waist and neither you or Jack are interested in taking it.\n\nSoon you both get back to the cabin where you drop your new loot and go warm up by the fire. The pair of you are silent as you sit, watching the flames flicker.\nJack however breaks up the silence eventually.\n\n\u201cSo, you really think that woman was the owner\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d Jack asks.\n\u201cMaybe wife, I dunno how it works here. Seems like the logical conclusion though.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cJust didn\u2019t notice a prominent second set of tracks around the cabin.\u201d\n\u201cWell it has been snowing off and on, there is the wind to think of, not to mention animals running around. Maybe she was walking behind him so she didn\u2019t have to get her boots engulfed with snow. All sorts of reasons why you might not have noticed them. Don\u2019t worry about it. Besides, you said it yourself, you\u2019re not a tracker.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose. I guess I just feel that missing a detail like that could be fatal given what we\u2019ve experienced as well as seen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, this does seem to be a pretty harsh place. Still don\u2019t know what the hell that blue gray thing was. Definitely want to avoid encountering those things though\u2026and those.\u201d You say pointing to the ugly head on the wall.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get rid of that thing later today. I know it bothers you.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cNah, it can stay. I\u2019m strangely sort of getting attached to Toothy over there.\u201d\n\nA pause of silence in the conversation follows before Jack speaks up again.\n\n\u201cIf that was his wife or girlfriend though, that\u2019s sort of fucked up that he just left her body like that.\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cWell, it seems like that thing was still chasing him, maybe he didn\u2019t know if was dead or not and wanted to get to a place where he could better defend himself and heal a bit. He could have always returned for the body.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMaybe. I just want you to know I\u2019ll never abandon you like that.\u201d Jack says causing you to chuckle.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s sweet Jack, but if I already got my brains splattered on the ground and there\u2019s a hulking monster around by all means run your ass to safety. No point in both of us getting killed.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about something like that. I just\u2026I can\u2019t imagine a life without you now.\u201d Jack responds and grabs your hand.\n\u201cWell with as brutal as this place seems to be, you never know.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t think about such depressing thoughts. I love you too much.\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s face displays one of concern, like he\u2019s worried you\u2019re going to die right this very second and he can\u2019t even bear the thought of you gone. It\u2019s apparent he\u2019s fallen for you a bit hard; perhaps a bit more than you\u2019ve fallen for him, but you suppose it\u2019s better that he\u2019s like this rather than not giving a shit.\n\nYou give him a reassuring hug.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much Jack, I\u2019ll try to last as long as I can in this world before the monsters get me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to survive. I bet you\u2019ll even survive longer than I will. You\u2019ll survive everything.\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s confidence in you is a lot higher than your own though you have to admit, you\u2019ve been doing pretty well so far. You\u2019re certainly not that \u201cgood girl\u201d that hid from the rest of the world any longer.\n\nYou have no idea what\u2019s in store for you or how you\u2019re going to deal with it, but whatever the future hold for you here, you will make your best attempt to survive and push through it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Eternal Mother\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a harsh world.\n\n\u201cNumber 660.\u201d\n\nPossibly more than your old one was, but you eventually learned how to deal with it. You even managed to make a proper life for yourself here despite all the trials and tribulations.\n\nYou remember how hard that first year with Jack was. Struggling to survive, learning how to hunt, dealing with the elements, dealing with unfriendly people and creatures, and generally just being a \u201cmodern\u201d person who didn\u2019t have too many survival skills to speak of and being thrust into a primitive environment.\n\nYou think learning the language was the most difficult part. Jack was always a little better at it than you were. You probably still sound like a retard to some folks, but it gets the job done.\n\n\u201cNumber 661.\u201d\n\nDuring those early years you also ended up having to do a few things you never took pleasure in doing, but it was always it was always for survival.\n\nIn those instances you were always a little better at that. Jack would definitely always support you, but then he loved you very much and would have followed you into the Gates of Hell.\n\nYou suppose it did get to a point where rationalizations really didn\u2019t excuse what you did, but then you don\u2019t think you ever cared about those anyway. You were a woman who was willingly dating a human sacrificing cultist at one time after all.\n\nYou smile upon thinking about your old flame. You think Bobby would have fit in very well in this world.\n\nMaybe to some extent, you did too.\n\n\u201cNumber 662.\u201d\n\nYou think for a while you might have gotten a little colder and ruthless. Seemed like this was a place where the strong ruled over the weak and fuck you if you couldn\u2019t keep up. From what you could tell people here had three choices:\n\nBeg and hope their tormenters took mercy on them, which was almost never likely.\n\nDie and just roll over to accept death because it was preferable to keep living in this shitty world.\n\nOr struggle and fight tooth and nail for what little you actually did have. And in that case you either won or kept it, or you died and lost it.\n\nYou know which one you chose.\n\n\u201cNumber 663.\u201d\n\nThings did change a little though when you had your first child. You never planned on ever having a family before, let alone one in a world like this one since it seemed more like a punishment than a blessing\u2026but Jack always had a way of making you see the positive.\n\nYou loved him for that.\n\nAnother child followed and for a while it seemed like everything was going well. You had a loving family, a larger dwelling; you weren\u2019t struggling to survive any more. You even had another baby on the way and you didn\u2019t even mind it.\n\nHell, you probably achieved quite a bit for a pair of former basement dwellers.\n\nYou were starting almost feel \u201cnormal\u201d or as normal as you could ever be or get in a place like this.\n\nAnd then just like everything in your life, it all eventually went to shit.\n\n\u201cNumber 664.\u201d\n\nWhile the occasional wandering ogres were certainly dangerous, they tended to stick a little further north. Other than that dead ogre you saw the first time you came here, you fortunately never encountered one in person again. The freedom fighting elves gave grief to the government, but never really made raids on civilian settlements. Indeed they tended to stay hidden.\n\nThe barbarian tribes however were always an ongoing problem in Rask, but you always figured you were far enough away from them and you knew there was at least an Empire Fort in the area they would attack first before moving deeper into more \u201ccivilized\u201d territory.\n\nOf course the Empire has always had a hard time maintaining order in this place. You suppose that was one of the upsides of living here, you didn\u2019t need to deal with the oppressive seemingly monolithic government that controls a vast amount of land here.\n\nBut it was also a downside as you would soon experience one dreadful day and the fact it all happened in broad daylight does make it seem all the more horrible.\n\nA small group of seven barbarians from the Wendigo tribe suddenly attacked, possibly the most vicious of all the tribes in fact. They attacked without warning and so fast, that your two children were dead before you or Jack could even spur into action.\n\nWhile you and Jack had long been experienced in combat during your time here, you and he were no match for them or their numbers. Especially in your condition at the time.\n\nYou sometimes wonder if a baby hadn\u2019t burdened you, you would have been able to at least save Jack.\n\n\u201cNumber 665.\u201d\n\nBefore he tried to hold them off to give you time to run, you remember Jack\u2019s last words to you;\n\nGo. Our child needs to survive. YOU need to survive.\n\nYou almost didn\u2019t want to. You almost wanted to meet death right there with him, but you think two things stopped you.\n\nOne, your will to survive has always been stronger than your defeatism.\n\nAnd two, you loved Jack enough to honor his last request.\n\nYou remember when you managed to get far enough away to the safety of a town; you broke down in tears and cried over him for at least a couple days. You still do sometimes. You miss him so much.\n\nYour eyes tear up a bit upon thinking about Jack and then you hear your number being called out. It\u2019s time to do this.\n\nMaybe you could look after this child, but it would be a struggle. A struggle you just can\u2019t do. Part of you feels like you\u2019re going back to your \u201cold ways\u201d by taking the easy way out, but you haven\u2019t come to this conclusion lightly.\n\nYou stand up and make your way to the front of the long waiting room. A tired looking clerk behind a counter looks at you and the bundle you\u2019re carrying.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cSuzy McCray.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cAnd I take it that this is the baby you wish to put into the care of the Empire?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Sign this, and you\u2019ll receive your payment.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want payment.\u201d You say which causes a very confused look on the clerk\u2019s face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t want payment? Well that\u2019s a first. We got some people here all the time bringing in babies. Probably stealing them in fact, but at least it\u2019s better than those dark elves do.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t want payment.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s sort of a law. You have to take something.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just make sure that he\u2019ll be given a good home?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t make that promise, I don\u2019t even do that process! I\u2019m just a damn underpaid government drone. If you\u2019re so damn concerned about him, why the hell are you giving him away?\u201d\n\nJust as you\u2019re about to yell at the clerk, another woman walks over. She has long white hair and very dark skin. She\u2019s very pretty. You wonder if this one of those svelk you\u2019ve heard about.\n\n\u201cFrieda, what\u2019s got you all flustered and generally acting like a typical monkey as usual?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cHuh? What the hell are you doing here? You slumming or something? Shouldn\u2019t you living the good life in the Emperor\u2019s Palace like my high and mighty brother?\u201d\n\u201cJealousy is a terrible thing Frieda especially when I\u2019ve spoken to Jacob on more occasions than I\u2019d care to and I can honestly say you have nothing to be jealous about\u2026 but then neither would he. However, for your information I\u2019m here on official business.\u201d\n\u201cHrm. Well good for you, now let me get back to my fucking job.\u201d\n\nAt this point you intervene.\n\n\u201cLook can we please get back to me?\u201d\n\nJust as the clerk is about to say something. The svelk woman speaks out again.\n\n\u201cFrieda. You\u2019re obviously burned out, why don\u2019t you let me take over for awhile?\u201d\n\u201cYou? Working a lowly job like this?\u201d\n\u201cSure, I\u2019m no stranger in performing tasks nobody likes to do.\u201d\n\u201cFine by me. I\u2019m going on a LONG break.\u201d She says and storms off leaving you and the svelk woman to talk.\n\nShe smiles at you in an attempt to be friendly, but right now you just want this to be over with and you\u2019re starting to think this was a bad idea.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to her, I\u2019m sure you have a very good reason for giving your child to the care of the Empire.\u201d The svelk says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to, you know.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI believe you. I don\u2019t think any mother truly ever wants to give up their child, but if I may ask, why are you doing it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026(sniffle) I lost my husband and other children in a Wendigo raid and I barely have anything left. (sniffle) I can\u2019t take care of him the way I want to. I mean maybe I could try, but I just don\u2019t have the energy left in me to do it. I don\u2019t have the drive and if I do a half assed job of it and something happens to him because I can\u2019t do my fucking job, then I\u2019m even shittier mother than I thought. I can\u2019t take another loss in my life.\u201d You say trying to keep it together.\n\nThe svelk woman nods.\n\n\u201cI see. I think I understand. So what is it that you were exactly arguing about before? I heard something about not wanting payment.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t, I\u2019m not selling my baby for financial gain, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m giving him to the Empire because I\u2019m hoping there is an off chance that the fucking government will do a better job at raising him or finding someone to raise him than I can because I\u2019m too emotionally drained to do it any more.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, I hate to destroy your hope, but many of the children put in the care of the Empire aren\u2019t exactly that much better off. In fact in some cases they might be worse and as for getting someone to adopt, well it\u2019s a possibility a good family will, but usually they\u2019re just passed off to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. So this has all been a waste of fucking time. Nice to know the Empire is fucking incompetent as well as being oppressive.\u201d\n\nTo your surprise the svelk woman laughs a little.\n\n\u201cYou speak your mind. I like that. Hmm. Well, tell you what I CAN put him in the special E Wing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cOh just a place where they often put unwanted babies from higher born families. Bastard children spawned by lust that would create social embarrassments, that sort of thing. Typically these children are very well looked after and special care is gone to make sure they aren\u2019t going to sweat shop owners or something equally hideous.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he would get a good home?\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe, I should inform you though that it\u2019s still rare and if not adopted within a certain period of time the Empire still raises them directly. These children are typically raised to be officers and commanders in the military. Their training is severe, but the results create very well disciplined and skilled men and women\u2026are you okay with your child possibly being given that sort of life?\u201d\n\nYou look down at your baby. He\u2019s been very quiet throughout all this. Hasn\u2019t cried once. Never been much of a crier really. It\u2019s odd. You begin to think about how harsh this world is, and maybe it would be best if your baby got that sort of life. At least he would be better able to survive this world. Much better odds than you can provide.\n\nYou begin to sniffle and cry. You nod.\n\n\u201cOkay (sob) okay. Do it. It\u2019s a better life than I can ever give him now. (sob)\u201d\n\u201cVery well.

You have my word and I say that as one of the Emperor\u2019s top advisors.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d You say, tearfully waving at your baby one last time.

You still don\u2019t know if you made the right decision, but it\u2019s done and now all you can do is hope.\n\nEventually in time you manage to get over your loss and move on with your life. You\u2019ve suffered much tragedy, but above all you\u2019ve always been a survivor and you\u2019ll survive this too. Jack was right about that.\n\nYears pass as years always do and eventually you grow old.

There are ambulances and police cars blocking the way and you realize you\u2019re going to have to go a different direction.\n\nYou go down some side streets and find out that they currently aren\u2019t much better and in one instance actually worse as a bunch of people have made a makeshift barricade with overturned cars and some of them are shooting at each other.

Everyone is acting like an asshole even more than usual.\u201d You say and you\u2019re starting to wonder if there\u2019s something in the water.\n\nTurning on the radio doesn\u2019t help, since you\u2019re not getting much on it save for those annoying Ground Zero ads.\n\n\u201cCome on, there\u2019s gotta be something about\u2026SHIT!\u201d you say when look up from the radio and are just in time to see a bus turning left and about to hit you.\n\nYou swerve immediately to avoid being hit, but unfortunately you slam the car into another speeding car, which crashes into your passenger side at full force.\n\nYou are knocked around as your car goes spinning across the street. It all happens so fast you don\u2019t even have time to panic or feel the fear of possibly dying right now.\n\nA large black truck slams on its breaks in an attempt to not hit you, which it succeeds in doing, only for your car to be stopped by lamppost instead. Thanks to airbags never working correctly when they should, you hit your head on the steering wheel hard and while you don\u2019t quite knock yourself out you definitely scramble your brains a bit and you\u2019re feeling pretty dazed.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still recovering, you suddenly hear knocking on your window and a voice.\n\n\u201cHey, miss. Miss? You alright?\u201d\n\nYou slowly look out your window and see a woman wearing glasses and dressed in business attire staring back at you. Well actually you\u2019re sort of seeing two of her and the image is still a little blurry, but that\u2019s the size of it.\n\nYou unhook your seat belt and get out of the car wincing in a bit of pain as you do so. The businesswoman helps you from falling since you\u2019re still wobbly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive, I\u2019ve seen a shitload of crashes like yours since I\u2019ve been driving through town today. I only just managed to put on my breaks when I saw your car spinning out of control like that.\u201d she remarks.\n\nYou don\u2019t really answer her; you just turn to look at the car, which is totaled. Besides part of the front being wrapped around a now leaning lamppost, the passenger side is trashed and you certainly aren\u2019t going to be driving anywhere soon due to the front wheel area being caved in and the axel broken.\n\nYou just look at the wreckage of the car silently and then start to giggle at the situation. Soon the giggling becomes full blown laughter and the woman that helped you out of the car gives you a strange look.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d she asks again.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m just peachy! This has been a wonderful day!\u201d you say laughing.\n\u201cDo you know your name and where you\u2019re at?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, my name is mud and I\u2019m in a world of shit.\u201d You say still laughing.\n\n\u201cUm, well you seem to be having a bit of difficulty balancing and you\u2019ve got a nasty bruise on your forehead. You might have a concussion and given your laughter you might even be in some state of shock. I think it would be best if you had some medical attention.\u201d\n\nYou look at the woman that\u2019s trying to help you and begin to stop laughing quite as hard and your mind starts heading back to earth again. Your head and body remind you of the pain you\u2019re actually still in.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026yeah\u2026maybe. Shit, my head does hurt\u2026 I guess\u2026can you drive me to the hospital?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe hospital? Yeah, that place is sort of fucked right now. Even if we could get to it in this mess of chaos, the place has been overflowing with patients and you might be waiting a long time, if they get to you at all. I\u2019m not sticking around in this town any longer than I need to. However, my brother is a doctor with his own private practice just outside town; he can probably check you out for free. It won\u2019t be any problem since I\u2019m going to him right now.\u201d The woman says.\n\nWell it\u2019s either head somewhere with a complete stranger or try to make it to the hospital (or wherever) in your current condition.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the woman up on her offer", "result": "Considering how fucked things are in town and your woozy condition, you probably wouldn\u2019t be safe walking the streets right now.

You around and see your accident isn\u2019t even being paid much attention to. Other vehicles are merely driving by and nearby onlookers lose interest. You look over at the other vehicle on the far end of the street that slammed into you. The front end of that one is trashed and the driver has gone half way through the windshield. He\u2019s a bloody mess and isn\u2019t moving.\n\n\u201cYou think that other driver is dead?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDunno, I didn\u2019t check on him. I just checked you first since you were closer to my vehicle. Just going by his appearance and the fact he hasn\u2019t moved I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t good. Can\u2019t save everyone though.

Comfy seats and everything. The dashboard looks like something out of a science fiction movie. Must be a really new model.\n\n\u201cYou doing okay over there? You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to pass out do you?\u201d the woman asks.\n\u201cNo, not really. Still just sore mainly.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Maybe you\u2019re okay for the most part, but it doesn\u2019t hurt for you to get checked out.

Still, sort of a strange reaction you had laughing about your car crash.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve just been having a really bad day and that accident just sort of topped it, so I guess I just laughed instead of crying like I have been doing for the past couple days.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, you been having a lot mood swings lately?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually have mood swings at all, but like I said, there have been some major events going down in what was my previously calm life that have really fucked with my stability. I\u2019m getting thrown out of my house, my boyfriend broke up with me, I can\u2019t get a job, I just trashed my brother\u2019s car and I have no idea what my future prospects are going to be. Things can\u2019t get much worse.\u201d\n\u201cOh they can always get worse, but yeah if all that shit has happened to you, then I guess your laughing at the car crash situation is a little understandable. Self defense mechanism and all.\u201d\n\nLilith\u2019s inquisitive nature causes you to be a little inquisitive too.\n\n\u201cYou a psychiatrist or something like that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cEh, something like that. I observe a lot of human behavior for the company I work for. Usually other employees, but lately it\u2019s mostly been non-employees in relation to the company.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have any job opening at this company for unskilled labor would you? A cleaning woman perhaps?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, well I\u2019m not exactly involved in the hiring process, but Ground Zero is a big company and we pretty much have a lot of openings for all kinds of positions. I\u2019m sure I could find something for you.\u201d Lilith says.\n\nThere\u2019s a pause as you aren\u2019t sure what you just heard.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. Did you just say you work for Ground Zero? That company that\u2019s been putting out all those annoying ads non-stop for the past few weeks?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cGuilty as charged. Trust me, I know how annoying those ads are all over the place, but I\u2019m not involved that department either.\u201d Lilith remarks.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you guys even had a headquarters here in a small town like this one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a small branch office really and it\u2019s so non-descript most don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there anyway. We do have a bigger place in Security City. Sometimes I go all the way out there to do my job too, but since I live just south of town it\u2019s a pretty long drive as you might expect. In those cases I usually just sleep at a hotel room paid for by the company until my work there is done.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said your brother lived south of town.\u201d\n\u201cHe does. We live together. It\u2019s a large house that\u2019s been in the family awhile and we did grow up there so we never wanted to get rid of it and we just decided to keep living there. Might sound a bit child like, but why move when you don\u2019t really need too?\u201d\n\u201cHey you don\u2019t need to tell me. I wish I didn\u2019t have to move from my home. So does your brother work for Ground Zero too?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNo. I wish he did since his talents would really be useful to us, but Leslie\u2019s really not a fan of the corporate lifestyle despite the fact that I keep telling him he wouldn\u2019t even be working in a position that requires dress codes and such. Leslie\u2019s also always been a bit of an independent thinker too. He could\u2019ve easily been a doctor working at a hospital pulling down lots of money, but he prefers his humble private practice. Who am I to tell him to do something that doesn\u2019t make him happy?\u201d\n\u201cWell you certainly sound like a more understanding sister than my own who is kicking me out of the house.\u201d You respond.\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s not right. Family should stick together. Well at least that\u2019s what I was always taught. Even when you don\u2019t agree with them, you should at least help them out, not leave them twisting. I\u2019m really sorry to hear that your sister is doing that to you.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cThanks for your sympathy, but she\u2019s always hated me and I imagine my brother will too now that I\u2019ve wrecked his car, though to be honest he didn\u2019t really care that much about me either. I\u2019m sort of a black sheep.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMm. Interesting. My brother and I are sort of black sheep as well, since we\u2019re not religious like the rest of the family, but like I said, it hasn\u2019t completely ruined our generally good relationship with most of them. To be honest though my brother\u2019s personality is more likely to do that than our lack of religious beliefs.\u201d Lilith laughs.\n\nYou aren\u2019t quite sure what to think right now driving with an employee of Ground Zero. Certainly was a pretty unexpected twist of events. It\u2019s even more surprising that she\u2019s seemingly pretty nice since you\u2019ve always had the idea that someone working for GZ would be on the cold and uncaring side. You\u2019re just hoping that after her brother checks you out, she\u2019ll help you out on the job front somehow. Whatever you\u2019d be doing, it probably would pay more than a cashier at a comic shop.\n\nYou and Lilith are silent for a bit while she tries to concentrate on getting out of town. Eventually after several near misses the pair of you are finally out of there.\n\n\u201cShit, I thought we were going into another accident a couple times.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been pretty crazy in town lately. Should be relatively smooth sailing from here though.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cHow far do you live?\u201d\n\u201cOh, not that far. We\u2019ll be coming up to it soon enough.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cYour brother must really be a good doctor to have patients coming all the way out here to see him. Is it mostly a steady supply of the richer folks making the journey?\u201d\n\u201cNot as many as you might think. Honestly, Leslie gets more people that don\u2019t have health insurance or are otherwise on the poorer side really. People who don\u2019t have anyone to help them. As to how folks get to the place, well my brother\u2019s got a couple assistants who drive people to him and they more or less provide this service for cheap. Occasionally my brother will drive people back to his clinic himself. Like I said, he could\u2019ve been pulling down a lot of money, but he prefers the more personal touch of private practice.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he certainly sounds like a humanitarian.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh he is. He is. More than you know.\u201d\n\nAbout a half hour passes and you see one of those old colonial houses in the distance. It\u2019s very isolated as there isn\u2019t another house in sight and you haven\u2019t seen another one since you left town.\n\n\u201cIs that your home?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s it.\u201d Lilith responds.\n\u201cPretty big. Looks very old.\u201d\n\u201cOh it is on both accounts. I mean of course inside has all the modern luxuries, but I wanted the outside to still have that old charm.\u201d\n\u201cPretty isolated out here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It has its advantages though.\n\nLilith soon turns and pulls into the house\u2019s extended driveway and stops the vehicle.\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019re here, you okay to get out of the car by yourself?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\u201cYeah. I actually don\u2019t even ache as much now and I\u2019m not dizzy at all. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ve just wasted your time.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNonsense, this hasn\u2019t been a waste of time at all. I actually enjoyed our conversation on the way here. I don\u2019t really talk to many people outside of work and my brother.\u201d\n\nYou get out of the truck and take a look at the house. It\u2019s even more impressive now that you\u2019re in front of it. A lot of care has obviously gone into its upkeep. You notice another car in the driveway that looks a lot less fancy than Lilith\u2019s truck. Must be her brother\u2019s vehicle.\n\nLilith is still in the truck fumbling around with something in her purse as you continue to take in the sights. Eventually she gets out though.\n\n\u201cOkay, sorry about that. I got so much shit in this bag I sometimes have to recheck to make sure I got everything.\u201d Lilith says clutching some keys and her large bag.\n\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go around the back. It\u2019s quicker to get to Leslie\u2019s office that way. Just follow that path.\u201d\n\nYou walk on the stone path that leads around the back of the house and Leslie follows closely behind. Along the way see a few rows of well-tended blue and purple flowers on both sides of the pathway.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t they lovely?\u201d Lilith remarks.\n\u201cThey certainly are colorful. I\u2019m not too familiar with flowers though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThey\u2019re called Morning Glorys. My brother though keeps calling them Morningstars. I think he only does that because that\u2019s our last name and he can\u2019t be bothered to remember a new name with morning in it.\u201d Lilith chuckles.\n\nYou stop walking.\n\n\u201cDid you just say your last name was Morningstar?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, why?\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s last name was Morningstar.\u201d You say.\n\u201cIs that right? Wow, what are the odds?\u201d\n\nYou suddenly feel very uneasy.\n\nYou slowly start to turn around and before you can react, Lilith grabs your arm and stabs it with a needle. She injects you with something before you can even pull away.\n\nWhatever it was is taking effect almost immediately and you\u2019re already beginning to lose your balance.\n\n\u201cCareful, careful. Don\u2019t fall on the flowers now.\u201d Lilith says.\n\nYou can\u2019t even speak; you just look at Lilith in shock as you fall on the pavement struggling to remain conscious.\n\nLilith crouches down and stares at you, as your eyes start to close.\n\n\u201c\u2026now I know who you are. Bobby mentioned you to me a couple times recently when he was trying to convince us to go live in his compound. Never figured you\u2019d be the same Suzy. (Sigh) Too bad you told me you two broke up though\u2026guess that explains why you\u2019re not at the compound with him.\u201d\n\nYou grab at Lilith, but she easily pulls away from your weak grasp. She just continues to look on at you as a scientist might look at a test subject.\n\n\u201c\u2026still\u2026I suppose this might make things a little more complicated. Oh well, I guess this will just make things a little more interesting too. Get some rest Suzy, we\u2019re going to have a big day tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWith those last words, you completely pass out.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and remembering everything that happened just before you passed out, you attempt to sit up immediately, unfortunately you can\u2019t due to being restrained. Your legs, your arms and even your body are all strapped down on a gurney.\n\nYou can\u2019t cry out either as you have a ball gag on your mouth. You can make loud \u201cMmhghm!\u201d sounds but that\u2019s about it.\n\nYour clothing has also changed. While you\u2019re not naked, you\u2019re in one of those hospital gowns. You don\u2019t feel sore or anything, so you can only hope you weren\u2019t raped during the time someone was changing your clothes.\n\nThe fear of what\u2019s going to happen to you is overwhelming.\n\nA quick glance around from you position shows that you\u2019re in a plain white room with no windows. There is a light above and a chair and door to your right, but to your left gives you cause for more terror as you see a table full of surgical instruments. A lot of them don\u2019t even look like proper surgical instruments so much as they look like torture devices.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much you can do except wait and attempt to stop crying though you fail in that endeavor. You just lie there thinking about how you said yesterday that things couldn\u2019t get any worse\u2026and then they did.\n\nYou think about what you could\u2019ve done differently to have made your life better and most importantly avoid the situation you\u2019re in now. You then think about how at some point, either Lilith, her brother or both are going to come in and start cutting you up and torturing you to death.\n\nYou\u2019re completely helpless and you wish that someone would just come in and save you from all this. The door suddenly opens and you turn your head hoping that somehow your magical thinking worked, but you only see Lilith walking in with a notebook in hand.\n\n\u201cFigured you should be up by now. Sorry to keep you knocked out for so long, but I\u2019m sure you can see it was completely necessary. Couldn\u2019t have you running away or anything.\u201d\n\nYou turn away from Lilith who then gets closer and stares at your face a moment.\n\n\u201cHmm, you\u2019ve been crying. Natural response I suppose given your situation. Good. (Sigh) I told my brother not to put those in here.\u201d Lilith says taking notice of the surgical instruments and shaking her head.\n\n\u201cHe probably thought it would be funny to have you even more terrified out of your mind than you already would be. I love Leslie with all my heart, but he really can be an inconsiderate asshole sometimes. Well most of the time really, anyway the main thing is don\u2019t pay any attention to those tools over there. That\u2019s not what I brought you in for.\u201d\n\nLilith puts her notebook on the table with the tools and addresses you again.\n\n\u201cNow. I\u2019m going to release your ball gag since I\u2019m sure it\u2019s uncomfortable. However when I do, I must ask you NOT to scream or anything like that. First of all it won\u2019t do any good. Second, it\u2019s terribly annoying. If we\u2019re going to have a positive relationship Suzy, it\u2019s absolutely necessary that you comply with my instructions. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really have much in the way of choices and resisting her with no way of actually doing anything would probably just result in something bad. You nod your head compliantly and Lilith takes off your ball gag.\n\n\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAh the predictable question first. Well, we\u2019re going to get to that and several other questions you might have, but we\u2019re going to be doing this my way. So while I know you\u2019re very nervous and scared, you\u2019re going to just have to wait a while before they get answered. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nOnce again you nod silently.\n\n\u201cGood. Very compliant. We\u2019re getting off on the right foot Suzy. Now then let\u2019s get to some of the more minor concerns you might have had running through your mind while you were laying here.\u201d\n\nLilith pulls the chair over to the table and after moving some of the tools out of the way she sits down, opens up her notebook and begins writing something in it while addressing you.\n\n\u201cI want to first alleviate any concerns you might have had about being sexually molested while you were unconscious. I assure you I undressed and dressed you myself. And since I\u2019m not a lesbian you were completely unharmed as far as that goes. I can see one of the obvious reasons that would cause Bobby to be enamored with you though. You\u2019re a very pretty girl with a nice body and it\u2019s obvious just by speaking with him he still loves you despite your break up.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026you\u2026you spoke with Bobby?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yes. Called him up as soon as I got you in the house. Took awhile to reach him, but eventually I did and I proceeded to have a very long conversation with him. I wanted to know more about you and only Bobby could provide those answers what with you being unconscious and all. He told me about how you met, your general personality, what you liked to do, and all of that stuff. When I asked what exactly caused the break up, he seemed to stumble over his words a bit. He claimed that he realized he couldn\u2019t abandon the silly family traditions, but it seemed like there was more to it than that because he kept insisting it was his fault and not yours. As if that was going to change what is going to be going on over here. You want to shed a little light on it Suzy? Please be honest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I (sniffle) didn\u2019t want to get married to him. I didn\u2019t want to live under the same roof as Diana since she was his ex and she hates me. I suppose\u2026I also wasn\u2019t fond of the idea of having a bunch of babies like he wanted either. Our argument sort of spiraled from there.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cHm, interesting. So you wouldn\u2019t consider yourself a domestic woman then. I suppose I can understand that. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to spend most of my time barefoot and pregnant and my whole life revolving around my man\u2019s needs. I don\u2019t think my brother would like that either. He gets so wrapped up in his experiments that I don\u2019t even see him for days sometimes and he\u2019d probably be homeless and living under a bridge if I wasn\u2019t working.\u201d Lilith chuckles and continues writing.\n\nYou remain extremely anxious about what\u2019s going to happen to you.\n\n\u201cI also can understand not wanting to live with my bitchy niece either. I know my nephew probably didn\u2019t think anything of it, but I also wouldn\u2019t have put it past him to hope for some sort of three way between you all. Good for you, putting your foot down like that.\u201d\n\nAll you can think is you\u2019d willingly have a three-way with Bobby and Diana if it got you out of this situation.\n\n\u201cAnyway when my nephew found out you were over here he practically pleaded for me and his uncle not to kill or harm you in any way. He even said he\u2019d be over to pick you up, but I told him that was completely out of the question since plans were already in motion. Still, I love my nephew and didn\u2019t wish to cause him any suffering so I agreed that you would not come to any harm as long as you followed the rules. So there\u2019s the obvious question answered.\u201d\n\nYou close your eyes silently thanking Bobby that he spoke up for you. Of course this doesn\u2019t make your fear disappear completely. Far from it, but at least you might have a glimmer of hope now.\n\n\u201cWith that out of the way, your other questions are probably what is going to be done to you. Well, before I called Bobby, my initial intention was to do some tests and study you since I wanted another subject to observe and I saw an opportunity to grab you when you nearly crashed into me. However, some things have obviously changed, but there is still is opportunity here so I\u2019m going to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what do you mean?\u201d you ask thinking Lilith has decided to completely twist her word to Bobby somehow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting to that. As you might\u2019ve noticed most of the folks in town have gone completely nuts. Well there\u2019s a reason for that and you\u2019re going to be one of the few people outside of the higher-ranking Ground Zero personnel to learn about it.\u201d\n\nLilith stops writing to give you her complete attention.\n\n\u201cWe put an experimental drug in the water supply and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing most people to act the way they\u2019re doing in town. In fact we\u2019ve done this to a lot of places. As bad as what\u2019s going on in town, I imagine it\u2019s even worse in a bigger populated area like Security City.\u201d Lilith says.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still worried about yourself, this bit of information is a little frightening for other reasons.\n\n\u201cWait. What? Why?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell there are very good reasons I assure you, but most of them probably wouldn\u2019t matter to most with any sort of so called ethical concerns on human testing. Indeed I don\u2019t even know all of the answers myself, I\u2019m just a small cog in a big relentless machine. All I can do is tell you this, the world IS going to change very severely and very soon and it\u2019s Ground Zero\u2019s goal to try to save the human race at any cost. Our shelters aren\u2019t the only way we\u2019re doing that.\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cBut how is putting crazy juice in the water supply doing that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not completely familiar with all the science involved, but it basically makes people more resilient to things like diseases, radiation, and even chemical gases. You know, anything that\u2019s likely to wipe out humanity on a wide scale when our glorious world leaders start pressing buttons. It seems like it increases strength and speed as well. Unfortunately it would seem it has a very negative effect on the mind, but that of course was an unintended side effect. However, if animal testing is anything to go by, those effects should only be temporary.\u201d\n\u201cBut how long do they last?\u201d\n\u201cWith animals? A few weeks, but we never really got to test on humans at least not on a wide scale. There were some individual tests I believe, but those were the earlier stages of the drug and the results of those weren\u2019t very positive. Ground Zero wanted to pick a populated area to do testing on years ago to hammer out all the problems quicker, but we had an agreement with government, which kept dragging its damn feet as usual on things. It didn\u2019t help that GZ was also temporarily burdened with some incompetent leadership for a while so we didn\u2019t get to do any of this until the last minute and now this is the result. Don\u2019t get me started on the faulty elevator problems in most of the shelters\u2026\u201d\n\nLilith at this point shakes her head and runs her fingers through her hair as if dismayed with how things have turned out. As she\u2019s doing this, a horrible conclusion comes to you.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026am I going to go crazy too? I drank mostly bottled water!\u201d you say.\n\u201cYes, a lot of people do these days, but most people still bathe regularly, brush their teeth and such and all that is still enough even if you\u2019re not drinking straight from the tap. As for if you\u2019re going to go crazy, well that\u2019s a matter of perspective. Given what I know about you, I have to say from a professional perspective you\u2019re not exactly a beacon of sanity Suzy, but then who of us really is right? If you were worried that you\u2019re going to start going into a violent fit of rage, I\u2019d have to say I don\u2019t think you are since you haven\u2019t already. The drug doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting everyone in town the same way for some reason. Not sure why, but again that\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping you around for observation. You\u2019re going to be my control subject as it were.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat it essentially means is as long as you cooperate and don\u2019t try to escape, you\u2019ll be well taken care of. I\u2019ll ask you questions, maybe do a few non-invasive tests and that\u2019s about it. If it seems you\u2019re completely fine, I guess we\u2019ll move on from there. For now though I think you should have better accommodations don\u2019t you? This room is rather spartan, I\u2019m going to take you to a new one. Now, I could call my brother in here or just wheel you to it still strapped to the gurney, but I\u2019d rather NOT do that Suzy. I want our relationship to be a trusting one. So, I\u2019m going to release you from your straps, you\u2019ll follow me and you WILL NOT try to escape or anything like that. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nOf course you\u2019re going to say yes to Lilith, no matter what, but your intentions are another matter.\n\nWhile Lilith seems like a reasonable lady, she\u2019s still a Morningstar and all that entails from what you know of that fucked up family. She might not be one of the chaos goddess worshipping brainwashed cultist ones, but she\u2019s obviously still not concerned with the value of human life and the only thing that\u2019s saved you is having a past relationship with Bobby and his continued feelings for you.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t look tough, of course looks can be deceiving, but you\u2019re pretty desperate and you REALLY want to leave. When she releases you, you could probably easily grab one of those surgical instruments and hold her hostage until you took her car and got out of this place.\n\nYou\u2019ve no idea where you\u2019d go, but anywhere would be better.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make no attempt to escape", "result": "You don\u2019t know the complete lay out of the house and you also don\u2019t really know Lilith excessively well to judge how \u201ctough\u201d she actually is. For all you know she\u2019s got some sort of GZ martial arts training especially given what she\u2019s revealed about what insidious practices they\u2019re doing.\n\nYou also don\u2019t know much about her brother, but he\u2019s probably a damn psycho. If you threatened his sister, he might be capable of anything; you know how close the Morningstar family tends to be after all\u2026\n\nAlso, so far this week, every time you\u2019ve \u201casserted\u201d yourself, it\u2019s gone very badly. Might be better to at least wait a while and see if a better opportunity comes along and get a feel for this place first.\n\nLilith undoes your straps and you\u2019re soon free. You sit up, stretch and try to maintain composure that you\u2019re not still scared about all this.\n\n\u201cI know the first time we met you were having problems walking by yourself. You okay to do that now? Not still feeling wobbly or anything?\u201d\n\u201cI believe I\u2019m fine. Just very nervous about all this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. As I said, follow the rules and you\u2019ll be fine. If you\u2019re worrying about catching the madness that the town has, well like I said, you\u2019re probably fine, but even if you aren\u2019t I\u2019ve got a few things that might help. You ready to go?\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess.\u201d You say and Lilith leads you out the door.\n\nWhen you exit, you find yourself in an uncarpeted corridor with a few rows of doors to the left and right of you (All with very strong looking and very locked doors). It reminds you of a hospital setting; you can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re still in Lilith\u2019s house anymore.\n\n\u201cUm, are we still in your house?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cOh yes. We\u2019re not on the ground floor if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering though, we\u2019re in the basement. Of course this house never had a basement this large originally. A lot of this was added on much later due to my work in GZ. Leslie nearly blew a gasket when he heard workers were coming in to make severe alterations to it, but in time he realized it had its advantages and I told him his area wouldn\u2019t be fussed with anyway. He spends a lot of time down here with his experiments you see and hates change\u2026guess you and he have that in common no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWell as I said, Bobby told me much about you and your past. Said you preferred to stay down in your basement and hide away from the world and weren\u2019t a fan of change yourself. Was he incorrect in what he told me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026no\u2026no I suppose he wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s true. I did spend all my time in the basement hiding out from the real world and hated change. This week has been a big wake up call that things couldn\u2019t be like that forever though.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHm, well don\u2019t despair. While things do eventually change, they can always change for the better. Here\u2019s your new room.\u201d Lilith remarks and unlocks it.\n\nThe door opens up to another windowless room, but this one is much nicer. In fact it\u2019s downright cozy. There\u2019s a sofa, a bookcase with books, a TV\u2026hell it almost reminds you of home. As enter to get a closer look at everything, Lilith is preoccupied with something on her phone.\n\n\u201cShit, well something came up and we\u2019re going to have to get to the questions later. But for now, what do you think to your new surroundings?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t expect to have such a fancy cell.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSuzy! Don\u2019t think of this as a cell, think of it as just a regular room where you\u2019re staying until it\u2019s confirmed you\u2019re okay! Now, if you notice there is another small room off to the right. That\u2019s the bathroom where you\u2019ll find all the usual facilities. I would imagine you\u2019re probably hungry and I\u2019ll be back with some food soon. Just have to deal with something. The National Guard has been deployed in town to maintain order and apparently GZ is sending some of their people to this house as added security. They\u2019re already on their way so I\u2019m going to have to go talk to my brother about this and make sure he curbs his anti-social behavior to a manageable level. Doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s got those two inbred redneck assistants of his with him right now. I can\u2019t stand those assholes. He\u2019s either going to have to keep them out of sight completely or make them leave\u2026(sigh) Ugh, anyway I\u2019ll be back soon, just make yourself at home.\u201d\n\nLilith closes the door, which you then hear lock and you\u2019re now alone.\n\nYou sit down on the sofa trying to wrap your head around all this. Never in a million years would you have thought you\u2019d be a prisoner by your ex-boyfriend\u2019s aunt who works for the corporation responsible for all those ads on TV and apparently involves in some seriously shady practices. Makes you think about some of those crackpots that posted conspiracy theories on various sites you read. Turns out some of them weren\u2019t too far from the truth after all.\n\nThe thing is, you can\u2019t even worry about something of that magnitude. For one thing, you have absolutely no power to do anything about it and second, you\u2019ve got the more pressing concern about what is going to happen to you.\n\nWhile things are going better than you thought they going to go, you\u2019re still not seeing a good end to any of this. Your luck has been up and down this entire week and just when something good seems to happen, something equally bad happens.\n\nYou don\u2019t trust Lilith completely, no matter how \u201cnice\u201d she\u2019s trying to be. At best Lilith keeps her word and you\u2019re not sick or infected only for her to ultimately execute you \u201chumanely\u201d with shot to your head. You can\u2019t imagine her keeping you alive after telling you her corporation\u2019s secrets like that. Unless of course she thinks you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone and even if you did, who would believe you anyway?\n\nThe darker picture is of course she said the world was going to change very soon implying a nuclear holocaust like all the GZ ads have been harping on about. Maybe she\u2019s told you because ultimately it isn\u2019t going to matter due to doomsday.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, where is that going to leave you? Maybe Lilith will release you alive, but leaving you to fend for yourself in a blasted wasteland of which you don\u2019t fancy your chances.\n\nAnd these are all the best-case scenarios you\u2019re envisioning, because you don\u2019t even want to think about the worst case, which is undoubtedly going to involve you being in more pain than you could ever imagine.\n\nYou have no more tears for any of this, because you\u2019re spent as far as that\u2019s concerned. You\u2019re still scared of course, but you feel like you\u2019re starting to become numb to very real possibility of death. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re giving up though and you proceed to study your surroundings, taking note of anything you could possibly use as a weapon. You don\u2019t find any secret passages or vents you could crawl around in because that only happens in the movies.\n\nEventually you take a break and lay down on the sofa, which at least is comfortable, you just wish you weren\u2019t wearing a damn hospital gown. You think about turning the TV on, but you figure it will probably just be full of Ground Zero ads.\n\nTime passes and eventually you hear the door opening up. At first you figure it\u2019s going to be Lilith, but it\u2019s not.\n\nTwo dirty looking men open up the door and enter. One of them is huge and has a slackjawed look on his face. He wears overalls that look like they\u2019ve never been washed. The smaller of the two is wearing a mechanic\u2019s jumpsuit and trucker\u2019s cap. When he sees you a big grin spreads across his face making him even creepier than the larger one.\n\n\u201cHoo wee! Well look at what we got here! Doc really has been fixing up this place, because that is one sweet piece I tell ya what!\u201d the smaller one exclaims.\n\nYou can only guess these must be Leslie\u2019s \u201cassistants.\u201d\n\nYou sit up immediately and try to arrange your gown to cover you as much as possible.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle ya darlin\u2019 but I\u2019m Jed and this here\u2019s my brother Hugo. What\u2019s yer name and what the hell are you doin\u2019 in here?\u201d the smaller one says.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Suzy, and this is my room. What the hell are YOU two doing in here?\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, easy there blondie. This is where me and Hugo always go to hang out when we\u2019re on standby as it were. No point in headin\u2019 back ta town right now anyway, since it sounds like the shit\u2019s really hit the fan out there, but never mind all that, what\u2019s all this about this bein\u2019 yer room? You some new live in whore for the Doc to fuck when his snooty sister isn\u2019t putting out?\u201d Jed asks.\n\nJed gets closer towards you meanwhile Hugo hasn\u2019t moved from the entryway. You\u2019re feeling very threatened.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m Lilith\u2019s guest, now will you please leave my room?\u201d you say.\n\u201cLilith\u2019s guest? Wait, you sayin\u2019 you HER whore? Well shit, I like the sound of that even better! So you ever been with a guy at all or are you strictly a pussy licker?\u201d Jed asks with a pretty predatory look in his eyes.\n\n\u201cThe pair of you better get out of here. Lilith has made it clear she doesn\u2019t want anyone else in here.\u201d You say standing up from the couch.\n\u201cOh is that right? Well I ain\u2019t heard nuthin\u2019 about it and I take my orders from the Doc, not his snobby bitch of a sister. So I think you better just settle down blondie. In fact, I think you better start making yourself REAL comfortable.\u201d Jed says and starts fondling his crotch while still approaching you.\n\nYou\u2019re steadily running out of options. About the only thing you can do now is either threaten them to the point that they back off or beg and hope they take mercy. Either option isn\u2019t likely to succeed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Threaten them", "result": "You focus your mind and try to muster up all your courage for what you\u2019re about to say next. It might very well be suicidal, but if the unthinkable is going to happen, then at least you can take comfort that you stood up to them even as scared as you are right now.\n\n\u201cLook, you fucking inbred rednecks, get the fuck out before you get in some major shit so deep that you ain\u2019t got the hip waiters for it!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nJed is hardly intimidated and his expression changes from perverted leer to burning hatred.\n\n\u201cHugo get out of that entryway and close that fucking door. I think this little blonde bitch needs to learn I don\u2019t take orders from whores. Let alone one that isn\u2019t sucking my cock, but I think we can change that situation.\u201d Jed says.\n\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s supposed to fucking scare me?\u201d you say and then Jed grabs you by both arms squeezing tightly. He presses his body against yours and looks down at you menacingly.\n\n\u201cOh I can tell you\u2019re scared bitch, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. And even if you weren\u2019t, you better damn well be. Last time I saw Doc\u2019s sister she was outside speaking with some soldier boys. She ain\u2019t gonna be down here in time to save your ass and if you think that we\u2019ll get in trouble for fucking you up, you over estimate your worth. At the most, we\u2019ll get chewed out by Doc, for pissing off his sister by wreckin\u2019 her kitty licking fuck buddy.\u201d Jed says.\n\nYou just look down after Jed\u2019s response. Still holding your arms tightly he addresses you again.\n\n\u201cWhat? Got nuthin\u2019 else to say? Yeah that\u2019s what I fucking thought. You fucking whores talk tough when you think you got a savior, but when the shit goes down, you shut the fuck up real quick.\u201d\n\nYou start laughing and look up at Jed\u2019s face, which is now showing a bit of confusion due to your response.\n\n\u201cYou truly are one dumb ass fucktard, Jed. You keep thinking I\u2019m Lilith\u2019s whore, or whatever fantasy YOU put in your own goddamn pathetic little head of yours. If I was her whore, don\u2019t you think I\u2019d be dressed more like one? Look at how the fuck I\u2019m dressed! I\u2019m in a fucking HOSPITAL GOWN! Who wears hospital gowns? FUCKING PATIENTS! I\u2019m her patient! I\u2019M FUCKING SICK AND CONTAGIOUS YOU STUPID ASSHOLE!\u201d you shout with a mixture of contempt and amusement.\n\nAt this point Jed takes his hands off of you and backs off a bit.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cOh what? Am I not so attractive now that you\u2019ve found out I might have shit that will make your dick fall off? Come on stud, I\u2019ll make it totally worth it! I guarantee it\u2019ll be the last fuck you\u2019ll ever need.\u201d You say and start grabbing at him and laughing.\n\nJed gives you a hard shove causing you to fall backwards.\n\n\u201cFuck! Hugo, this bitch has got the crotch rot somethin\u2019 fierce! Open up that fucking door!\u201d Jed shouts.\n\nHugo comprehends the situation just well enough to follow Jed\u2019s orders and it doesn\u2019t take long before they\u2019re both out the door. Unfortunately Jed isn\u2019t quite so stupid to leave the door open or unlocked since you hear a firm click. Of course maybe he was just so scared of you possibly getting out that he took the time to lock it. In any case you got rid of them and you\u2019re alone again.\n\nYou\u2019re quite pleased that this is the first time you actually employed an assertive method this week and it worked out. Your arms hurt from Jed squeezing them though.\n\nA half hour later, you hear the door again. This time it\u2019s Lilith and she looks somewhat harried when she comes in. She\u2019s also carrying a tray of food with what looks to be meat on it and some potatoes on it. She places it on coffee table in front of the sofa and also gives you a bottle of water. She then sits down on the chair Jed was sitting in.\n\n\u201cWhew. Sorry about that. Just one thing after another. Anyway, there\u2019s your food. It\u2019s left over meatloaf from yesterday that I heated up. Hope that\u2019s okay. We still had quite a bit left and I didn\u2019t really have time to prepare anything else. Leslie usually does most of the cooking around here anyway.\u201d\n\nYou stare at the meatloaf, which doesn\u2019t look all that appetizing. The potatoes look okay though. You notice your eating utensils are plastic. Guess Lilith isn\u2019t completely trusting of you either.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re not a vegetarian are you?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\u201cUm, no. Not at all.\u201d You say and poke at the meatloaf.\n\u201cYou think I poisoned the food?\u201d\n\u201cActually I didn\u2019t think that, until you just mentioned it. I was just thinking of how unappealing the meat looks.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell not that this might help calm your fears, but I didn\u2019t poison or drug the food. There wouldn\u2019t be much point in it; you\u2019re my control subject after all. As for the look of the meat, well my brother\u2019s a good cook, but he\u2019s never been big on presentation, but I assure you it tastes much better than it looks. Of course you don\u2019t need to eat it. There are potatoes there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll eat. I\u2019m hungry enough and I don\u2019t have that much choice.\u201d You say.\n\nYou take a bite of the meatloaf and it\u2019s actually just like Lilith said, it looks awful, but it does taste good.\n\n\u201cYou were right.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell I do understand the hesitation. I remember some of the meals my brother has made in the past and they looked more like something that already was digested. He\u2019s gotten a bit better with it though. Anyway, so how have you been feeling? Still no sudden mood swings or violent urges or anything I trust?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\u201cWell no, but I did have to act crazy to get two redneck assholes out of here.\u201d\n\u201cOh no. (Sigh) Jed and Hugo came in here? I told my brother not to let those assholes wander around down here picking the locks to places they\u2019re not supposed to be going anyway!\u201d\n\u201cApparently they were under the impression I was your personal whore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Why the hell would they think\u2026nevermind\u2026they didn\u2019t do anything to you did they?\u201d\n\u201cNo, like I said, I acted crazy. Or more specifically I convinced them I was sick and contagious. They left real quick after that.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, good thinking. Explains why I saw their shitty pick up truck screech out of here earlier.\u201d\n\u201cHope to never see them again.\u201d You say continuing to eat.\n\u201cYeah well that will be arranged. I\u2019ll tell my people stationed outside to shoot them on sight if they return. I don\u2019t care if Leslie complains about it either. Besides, there\u2019s news that we all might not be staying here much longer.\u201d\n\nYou stop eating for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell as I said, the National Guard are currently stationed in town and trying to maintain order. While they might succeed, GZ doesn\u2019t fancy their chances and would rather not lose a valuable employee such as myself in the possible chaos that will spill over. So they\u2019re ready to ship me and my brother out of here to a GZ shelter, a proper company one, not the ones that have been built for the common public. It\u2019s just as well considering the reports we\u2019ve been getting on the world situation.\u201d Lilith says.\n\nYou take a drink of water wondering what this means for you.\n\n\u201cWhen is this going to happen?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cMaybe tomorrow, definitely by Friday. I\u2019m going to miss this house, so many good memories here especially with Leslie. I can only imagine the talk I\u2019m going to have to have with him. Looks like he\u2019s going to have company job whether he wants one or not. Oh well, he\u2019ll get used to it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d you interrupt.\n\u201cWell, that is the question isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lilith says, taking off her glasses and rubbing her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhile I haven\u2019t been able to do the tests and ask the questions like I wanted to earlier today, I\u2019m fairly certain you\u2019re fine and you\u2019re one of those few that aren\u2019t affected by the side affects of the drug. I have a few theories on why that might be, but nothing solid. It doesn\u2019t really matter anyway I suppose at this late stage.\u201d Lilith remarks.\n\u201cSo\u2026I\u2019m free to go?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, I do want to keep you for observation for one more day. I mean might as well since we might not be leaving tomorrow anyway. After that, well I suppose it\u2019s up to you. If you want to leave, you will be allowed to leave. You probably should keep in mind however, that returning to town might not be the best idea, so I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019d go. Do you have anywhere to go?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I mean I don\u2019t have my phone so I can\u2019t even call anyone who might give a shit. Not that my family would give a shit of course, so I don\u2019t really even have a home at this point.\u201d\n\u201cHm, well that leads me to the other possible option, that I can probably take you with us. Might take some string pulling and calling in of favors, but if you want to come with us, you can.\u201d\n\u201cGo with you? To a GZ Shelter? What would I do there?\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure we could find something, no need to worry about that. You\u2019d have to follow the rules there though. Life would be quite different, but with the way things are going, I\u2019m sure life is going to be different anyway.\u201d\n\nYou just nod silently as Lilith stands up to head back to the door.\n\n\u201cTell you what. Let\u2019s dispense with any more interrogation today. You already had to deal with waking up strapped to a gurney, not knowing where you were, being told that the world may end soon and that you may or may not suffer a negative side affect of a drug, not to mention those redneck rapists barging in here. I think you deserve to relax for the rest of the day and night.\u201d\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cFor today it is. Like I said, just make yourself at home for now. This will all be over soon and you won\u2019t be a prisoner here. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been making this easy Suzy. That\u2019s definitely a good thing.\u201d Lilith says and leaves.\n\nAlone once again and now you\u2019ve got the whole night to contemplate your situation, which has changed again.\n\nEscape is now looking unnecessary given that Lilith seems to not have any insidious plans of going back on here word. You\u2019re not even sure it would be a good idea to do so anyway now considering she mentioned GZ security are now guarding the perimeter of the house.\n\nOf course that still leaves the question of \u201cwhere will you go?\u201d While she\u2019s already warned you about town, you really don\u2019t have anywhere else. You don\u2019t even have a vehicle. You suppose you could always just risk heading back home or maybe even Julie\u2019s assuming either place is still standing.\n\nThe offer to go with Lilith and her brother is just odd though. It really is an unknown factor, but if things are really getting as bad as Lilith claims, maybe you need to embrace the unknown.\n\nYou spend the rest of the night pondering your options until you eventually get sleepy and drift off on the couch.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up once again a prisoner, though perhaps not for long and despite everything, you\u2019re actually feeling slightly optimistic about your situation. Very slightly.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure what time it is, but knowing your usual sleeping habits, it\u2019s probably at least the afternoon. You imagine you\u2019ll be getting a visit from Lilith as usual soon so you start perusing the nearby books until she comes in. You pick one that looks interesting to you.\n\nAs you\u2019re reading \u201cUnusual Sexual Practices From Around the World\u201d you start hearing the faint noise of what sounds like yelling or shouting. Doesn\u2019t really sound like any actual words though, more like just noises, still the sound isn\u2019t completely distinct.\n\nA few minutes later you hear something that sounds like a gunshot. You start to worry and keeping you ears open, but you don\u2019t hear anything else unusual until you hear that familiar sound of the door opening up. Fortunately it\u2019s Lilith and not someone who isn\u2019t supposed to be in here. Once again she looks a bit beleaguered as she carries in what looks to be a small medical bag and a notebook.\n\n\u201cUm, is everything okay? I thought I heard shouting and a shot.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah, I imagine you would have given your proximity. You remember I said you were my control subject? Well some of the others down here aren\u2019t and they\u2019ve been getting worse. My brother just put one down that was starting to break his restraints. I have a feeling the rest are going to have to be put down as well, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to bother having them transported with us when we leave, which is looking like today since shit is reportedly getting even worse in town.\n\nThe \u201cputting down\u201d of subjects is a little concerning until Lilith immediately follows up her statement.\n\n\u201cRelax, you\u2019re not getting shot unless you start regressing into a savage and let me guess, you\u2019ve experienced no problems correct?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Feel fine. Just a little anxiousness, especially being near people that might be turning into beasts.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. They might escape the restraints, but they aren\u2019t escaping out the rooms. We made sure of that when we had this area built it had solid doors and walls. Anyway, since things are moving rather quickly now I suppose I\u2019ll just wrap up your little part in this observation which isn\u2019t going to take long.\u201d\n\nLilith at this point pulls out a syringe and a tourniquet along with some cotton balls and rubbing alcohol.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m just going to draw some blood, not inject you with anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you need my blood for?\u201d\n\u201cOh just need another sample for testing. I mean I already drew blood from you when you were unconscious a day ago, so this is just a follow up really. Considering you\u2019re not frothing at the mouth or destroying this room by now, I\u2019m very certain you weren\u2019t affected by whatever exposure of the drug you might have in contact with, but never hurts to be thorough. Your arm please.\u201d\n\nLilith has more or less been playing square with you so reluctantly you hold out your arm and after prepping it she begins to draw blood.\n\n\u201cUgh, hate needles.\u201d You say looking away.\n\u201cMost people do. Leslie used to hate them too. Still does actually. Really odd considering he\u2019s a doctor and uses them on a regular basis\u2026then again I suppose it\u2019s different when you\u2019re using them on other people. There we go.\u201d\n\nLilith finishes up and you\u2019re rubbing your arm watching a tube of your blood go into another container and then placed back into the bag. Lilith then starts flipping through pages of her notebook.\n\n\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019ll be free to leave soon?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll have the clothes you were wearing brought to you soon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of wearing the gown. After that well, I guess you can make your decision on whether to go or come with us. I contacted a few high ups at the offices and they said it was fine if I brought you.\u201d She answers without looking up.\n\u201cOh. Well I guess that does open up options for me then.\u201d You say still unsure of what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nYou have been meaning to ask Lilith about something she said to you yesterday though.\n\n\u201cHey, I was sort of wondering\u2026what did you mean yesterday about me not being a beacon of sanity?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cFunny you should ask, since I was just about to do a last minute interview with you, so I had at least a few more things to put down in my report. Most of what I\u2019ve got on you is only through observation or what Bobby told me. It would be nice if I had something directly from you. Of course as I keep complaining about, things haven\u2019t been ideal lately.\u201d\n\nLilith finds the page she was looking for and then focuses complete attention on you.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question\u2026keep in mind this is based on all observation and mostly Bobby\u2019s words so I\u2019ll admit this isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate assessment of your personality. No offense is meant, but here\u2019s my impression of you and why and please feel free to interject whenever you want.\u201d\n\nLilith goes into a psychological assessment of your character and while you do fill in on some of what she might be missing and clarify on other aspects of your life, she doesn\u2019t really lose a beat in her view of you, indeed it only seems to enhance it.\n\nShe starts off by talking about your introverted behavior to the point of falling into escapist behavior. She discusses that some of this is due to being the product of a dysfunctional family where you were only ever close to your mother since she was the only one that ever displayed any positive attention and when she died that was one of the major turning points of you shutting yourself off from the world and \u201cgiving up\u201d in general. However Lilith mentions that this relationship wasn\u2019t exactly the healthiest since it placed pressure on being \u201cgood and proper\u201d which apparently had some negative effects on not just you, but your other sisters as well.\n\nThen she mentions that while you finally broke out of this shell a bit when you met Bobby, that relationship wasn\u2019t exactly built on a stable foundation to begin with and indeed just fed into your world of fantasy on some level, with Bobby being a \u201cPrince\u201d whisking you away from the clutches of a \u201cvillain\u201d (Your uncle in this case). Most of your relationship was co-dependency and enabling behavior since who would anyone that considered themselves \u201cnormal\u201d stay with a man who doesn\u2019t just murder people, but essentially runs a cult?\n\nShe then goes on to say that while she does think you did care for Bobby on some level, she doesn\u2019t believe that you were really capable of ever loving him and not because of his sister, but because deep down you\u2019re not really capable of the emotion at all. She mentions that you\u2019re so used to your own company and withdrawn that you can\u2019t even form proper attachments. Even a \u201cnon-normal\u201d one like you had with Bobby.\n\nShe finishes up by saying that while much of your personality can be explained by \u201cnurture\u201d, there is evidence that all of the behaviors you exhibit were all just laying in wait to flourish anyway. Other members of your family have their own personality problems (Sadism, suicidal depression, narcissism, nymphomania, paranoid delusions, psychopathy, etc) meaning that it\u2019s probably all genetic on some level. She even believes that under certain circumstances you could not only be capable of great violence, but also revel in it.\n\n\u201cBut what does all this mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNothing much as far as my report goes except maybe a half assed theory on why the drug didn\u2019t seem to have an affect on your mind. I suppose for you it\u2019s greater insight on yourself, but I\u2019d wager that given your introspective nature, you\u2019ve probably already pondered all of what I\u2019ve just told at one time or another. It\u2019s probably why you\u2019re not really insulted by my words, because you probably agree with everything I said on some level.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t really have a response because what Lilith says is somewhat true. It\u2019s actually pretty damn scary how accurate she was given that all her information was mainly based on Bobby\u2019s words and the few conversations she\u2019s had with you.\n\n\u201cWow. Well I guess you didn\u2019t go the typical route and say I was a closet lesbian or something.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a closeted lesbian.\u201d Lilith chuckles.\n\n\u201cYou just have some repressed bisexual tendencies, but that\u2019s really a very minor point in the scheme of things. Anyway, I think we\u2019re done. I\u2019ll go grab your clothes and\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly the door opens up and you see an older man with wild hair that\u2019s completely white in color. He wears a bloody lab coat and has a pistol in one hand. You wonder if this Leslie.\n\n\u201cSis, you need to get your ass out here. We\u2019re under damn attack and we could use another pair of hands to hold a weapon out here.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWho the hell is attacking?\u201d Lilith says.\n\u201cWho do you think? Damn crazies from town and your GZ boys aren\u2019t exactly the crack team they think they are. Just saw one of those fucking cowards run off\u2026well before he got tackled and eaten by a bunch of those crazy fuckers.\u201d\n\u201cShit, they probably sent a bunch of fucking rookies. (Sigh) Fine, let\u2019s go Leslie. Suzy, you might want to stay here.\u201d\n\nLilith gets up to go with her brother, and the pair of them leaves the room. You don\u2019t hear a click this time and you get curious\u2026\n\nYou get up and try the door, and find it hasn\u2019t been locked this time. They were probably in too much of a hurry to bother.\n\nYou sort of wonder if you shouldn\u2019t take this opportunity to escape on your own terms, since you still have a bit of a trust problem with Lilith considering she did make a lab rat out of you. (Doesn\u2019t matter if she was \u201cnice\u201d about it)\n\nOf course maybe you\u2019d be safer in here if there crazy cannibals out there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the room", "result": "You\u2019re not staying in here like a sitting duck. If whatever the things are that are attacking the house succeed in overrunning the place, you\u2019d be trapped. Better you at least get to an area where you can run somewhere else, and with any luck you\u2019ll be able to escape this place altogether.\n\nYou exit the room and quickly run down a corridor where you hope you\u2019ll some stairs in that direction, because with as noisy as the other patients are, you have just as much fear that one of them is going to get out their locked rooms and attack you despite the fact Lilith says they\u2019re secure.\n\nYou soon find the stairs leading up and the sounds of gunfire and shouts get even louder. You hear a lot of glass breaking as well.\n\nAll the action seems like it\u2019s going on in the front part of the house, so that\u2019s where you head away from and soon find yourself in the kitchen.\n\nFrom the kitchen you can see a door leading to backyard. Looking out the window, it doesn\u2019t appear that any of those crazy people are attacking from this direction so that\u2019s one good thing. It also looks like the fence would be very hard to climb since it\u2019s a smooth high wooden fence. If you were planning to escape, your chances of doing it this way have decreased.\n\nStill, you also notice the tree in the yard with branches that hang over the fence. You probably could climb it and drop down if you really wanted to get away. Of course with all those things out there, that might not be the safest plan, even if they aren\u2019t coming from this direction. You also feel a little vulnerable what with just wearing a hospital gown.\n\nThen you hear the chaos going on within the house and the sounds of what you think to be those things finally getting into this place.\n\nWasting no more time, you look around for a weapon and a nasty looking machete catches your eye. You have no idea what one of these would be doing in the kitchen, but you\u2019re taking it and getting the hell out of here.\n\nAs you\u2019re opening up the door you hearing the sounds of battle getting more hectic, in fact it even sounds like it\u2019s getting closer to your location\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna check around back to make sure none of them are\u2026HOLY SHIT!\u201d A uniformed man with a GZ logo on it exclaims when you turn to face him.\n\nHaving no idea who you are, seeing you hold a machete in your hand, the fact that you just opened the backdoor and him being totally surprised by your presence causes him to do the only logical thing a man in his position would do.\n\nHe thinks you\u2019re a hostile and immediately opens fire on you with his rifle. You don\u2019t have time to do anything except fatally catch bullets at that point.\n\nWhen the chaos dies down, Lilith is annoyed about losing you as her control subject, but she gets over it.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay in the room", "result": "You might be reverting back to old habits, but if there is some hectic bullshit going on out there, then you want to avoid it. They can handle it and you decide to be extra cautious and block the door with a chair.\n\nYou hear the sounds of gunfire above you. That isn\u2019t what bothers you so much as it\u2019s the growling and yelling that sounds like it\u2019s coming from nearby. You remember that there are other \u201cpatients\u201d on this same floor.\n\nMore time passes and you still hear gunshots and the inhuman noises. You are starting to worry that it\u2019s quite possible this house is going to be overrun by these things, and you haven\u2019t even seen one. This fear becomes even more intense when you stop hearing the gunshots and only hear the guttural noises nearby. You start to feel like you\u2019ve made another bad choice.\n\nSuddenly there\u2019s an attempt to open the door only to be stopped by the chair you\u2019ve propped against it. This is followed by a loud bang on the door, which scares the hell out of you.\n\n\u201cSuzy! What the hell? Is this door barricaded?\u201d you hear Lilith\u2019s voice shout.\n\u201cYeah\u2026is it safe?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe in that we\u2019re not in any immediate danger, but we gotta start getting the hell outta here. Open up!\u201d\n\nWasting no time you move the chair and the door opens up. Lilith throws your clothes at you and you can hear those awful noises in the corridor. Yelling and banging.\n\n\u201cHere. Get dressed and don\u2019t worry about the noises, the other subjects aren\u2019t getting out of those rooms anytime soon.\u201d Lilith says.\n\nYou\u2019re not as sure as Lilith is about that, so you just get dressed as fast as you can and exit the room with her.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d you ask as you follow her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on is Leslie and I are heading to that GZ Shelter after he and I gather a few things. The crazies from town are spilling out from it and we don\u2019t want to be here in case another wave comes. I was hoping to have more time to pack, but I guess we can\u2019t have everything.\u201d\n\nYou and Lilith get to the ground floor and finally see the house proper. It\u2019s a bit of a mess now probably due to all the running around and shooting, but obviously was nice at one time. Then you enter the front room and see several broken windows, and couple of dead bodies. One of them is a uniformed man with his throat ripped out and several slashes across his face.\n\nNearby him is a body of a disheveled looking woman with several bullet holes in her body and head. She still has a chunk of flesh in her teeth and even in death her eyes display a crazed look. It sort of freaks you out.\n\n\u201cUm, that guy in the uniform, shouldn\u2019t someone shoot him in the head?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. These aren\u2019t zombies. They\u2019re just well\u2026rabid.\u201d Lilith chuckles. \u201cHeadshots aren\u2019t even necessary to kill them, though it sure as hell helps.\u201d\n\nA couple more uniformed men with the Ground Zero insignia on them walk into the room holding rifles.\n\n\u201cPlace seems to be all secure Dr. Morningstar. No other hostiles in the house or around the house.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cGood. Glad not all of you were incompetent. Wait, are you two the only ones left?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid so doctor.\u201d One of them remarks.\n\u201cOh well. Okay, I want you two to stand guard out front. Make sure there isn\u2019t another horde or whatever coming our way and if there is, run back in here and tell me immediately.\u201d\n\nThe two uniformed men nod and leave out the front door which is now half hanging off the hinges. You and Lilith both take a quick look outside and see the bodies of several crazies as well as GZ security. In the driveway you see that Lilith\u2019s truck is heavily shot up and a couple bodies of crazed townies lie next to it.\n\n\u201cGreat, these assholes never learned the concept of one shot one kill. (Sigh) Guess we\u2019re all just piling into the Ground Zero van.\u201d Lilith says shaking her head.\n\nLilith continues looks around a bit more at her partially destroyed house.\n\n\u201cWell at least nobody has to clean this up this time. I remember the many many times I\u2019d come home from work and I\u2019d find Leslie had left a damn mess all over the house, much worse than this sometimes even. A lot more bodies too. Still remember the disorder he left when he was trying to write a poem for me on one of our past anniversaries. But it was such a lovely and thoughtful sentiment so I wasn\u2019t too mad\u2026anyway have you made your decision of what you\u2019re going to do yet?\u201d Lilith asks.\n\nYou still really aren\u2019t sure and lacking an answer, you ask a question.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do at the shelter again?\n\u201cWell I told you, I\u2019m not in charge of assignments, but I\u2019m sure there would be some sort of position there for you. Ground Zero doesn\u2019t waste resources.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nLilith looks at you with a squint.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026still don\u2019t trust me do you? Don\u2019t answer. I know you don\u2019t. (Sigh) I suppose I don\u2019t blame you. Look, if you don\u2019t want to go with us you don\u2019t have to, I meant that. Still, I think it would be foolish if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be equally foolish if I went with you. Who knows what the hell is in store for me in an underground shelter.\u201d You say.\n\u201cTrue, but think on this. If I really had anything bad in store for you there, don\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve just had security and my brother restrain you and take you there against your will anyway? I\u2019m giving you a choice. You can go with us, or not. One of your problems Suzy is you don\u2019t take chances, you stick with what you think is safe and look where that has gotten you. But if safety is your main concern, I\u2019m just going to say that staying here isn\u2019t exactly the safe option. This house isn\u2019t secure, you\u2019ll have a few days of food and water at best and if the crazed townsfolk don\u2019t come ripping this place apart again, there are always just the plain opportunists that are no doubt lurking about as well. You don\u2019t even have a vehicle to leave this place. Mine got all shot up and we\u2019re taking the other one. Do you even have a plan if you stay here?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t\u2026as usual.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d you reply.\n\u201cWell I\u2019d think your choice would be simple then. Anyway, I have to bags to pack and when I\u2019m done, I\u2019m going to need to know what your answer is Suzy.\u201d Lilith remarks and leaves you by yourself.\n\nYou walk around the ground floor of the house a bit, just looking around. You start to form various thoughts in your head about how this place could be made more defensible. You just aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re up to the task though.\n\nYou briefly consider the idea of somehow overpowering one of those GZ security guys outside and driving off with the truck yourself, but you aren\u2019t confident that you\u2019d be successful. You then wonder if you could successfully flirt with one of them\u2026\n\nYou head outside and speak with both of the guards while attempting to be as charming as you can. You even manage to muster up the fortitude to blatantly make sexual innuendo and such.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work. One of them is gay and the other is happily married and even if that wasn\u2019t the case, they get irritated at the fact that you\u2019re distracting them from their duty and start telling you to go away. You realize your plan isn\u2019t going to work and you give up.\n\n\u201cChrist Suzy, some seductress you are.\u201d You mutter to yourself.\n\nThis brings you back to your original two choices and both of those have the potential to go to shit for various reasons, but it\u2019s all you got.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the shelter", "result": "It does seem very likely that if Lilith were going to do something to you, she would\u2019ve done it already. Plus you haven\u2019t given her any trouble like she wanted, so that\u2019s has to be in your favor.\n\nAlso, she makes some very good points about staying here. Civilization as you know it seems to be failing hard and you aren\u2019t exactly the \u201csurvivalist\u201d type to deal with it. Seems like it would be too late to start learning how in the final hour too, even if you had the desire.\n\nWhile you aren\u2019t exactly sure how life would be in an underground shelter, you can\u2019t help think that you\u2019d be more \u201cat home\u201d there. After all it\u2019s just an oversized basement right?\n\nIt\u2019s a risk, but it\u2019s one you feel more confident about mainly because it requires little effort on your part. You sit on one of the few non-broken chairs and wait for Lilith.\n\nA few moments pass and you hear footsteps coming up from the basement accompanied by some swearing and more footsteps in one of the other rooms.\n\n\u201cWhere the fuck did I put that fucking thing? Shit, better not have lost\u2026oh good here it is.\u201d You hear Leslie say before he soon enters the front room where you\u2019re waiting for Lilith.\n\nLeslie carries two sizable black bags and a machete when he enters the room. He stares at you for a moment, which makes you a bit uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIs my sister still upstairs?\u201d he asks, but it\u2019s more like an order due to his tone.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cTypical. She\u2019s the one dragging me to this fucking shelter and I\u2019m ready before she is. I swear I don\u2019t want to go to this fucking place. Let alone working there. The idea of becoming part of a corporate fucking machine is just a fucking anathema to me. Probably have some little shit bean counter for a boss telling me he wants something done at a certain time. I fucking hate shit like that. I fucking hate it. I don\u2019t like being told what to do, when to do it, or ANYTHING!\u201d\n\nAt this point Leslie begins shaking his machete in a violent manner and you see his eyes briefly roll into the back of his head like he\u2019s going to go into a convulsion.\n\nThen all of a sudden his eyes snap back and he addresses you again.\n\n\u201cBut the things we do for love right?\u201d Leslie says.\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\u201cMm. Speaking of love, my sister has told me a bit about you and it\u2019s too bad you and my nephew didn\u2019t work out. Guess he\u2019ll be stuck with his shrew of a sister now. If he\u2019s smart, he\u2019d ditch her and go for his other one\u2026can\u2019t remember her fucking name\u2026really quiet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHelen?\u201d you answer.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her. You sort of remind me of her a bit. You\u2019re prettier of course, but same sort of wallflower personality. You get molested as a child? Daddy ever make you suck his dick when Mommy wasn\u2019t around? Something like that?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d you say not expecting such a question.\n\u201cHm, interesting. Would\u2019ve thought you had been, especially since I heard your family was a bit on the dysfunctional side.\u201d\n\u201cWell they weren\u2019t THAT dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nLeslie gives you a look of annoyance, which makes you a little tense, well more tense than when he was waving his machete around earlier.\n\n\u201cOh. I see. That was a shot at MY family right?\u201d Leslie exclaims.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d you start to say.\n\u201cNo, YOU know what you meant and so did I! Is that why you didn\u2019t stay with my nephew? Felt you were too good for him?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the reason, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPfft, I don\u2019t want to fucking hear it! Here I am trying to make the effort to have friendly fucking conversation with you and you\u2019re fucking insulting me! Well fuck you too bitch!\u201d Leslie says and when you see him starting to walk in your direction you begin to get worried, but instead he storms out the front door.\n\nJust as you\u2019re recovering from that incident of Morningstar insanity, Lilith comes walking down from upstairs carrying a couple bags.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on down here? I heard my brother ranting as usual. Everything okay?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI dunno. He started talking to me and I tried to be friendly, but he took what I said out of context and got really pissed at me.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah, been there before. My brother\u2019s not very good at social interaction unless that other person also happens to be an asshole. Nevermind him, you\u2019re fine. Anyway, did you make your decision? Are you going with us?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026I was, but now I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Is it my brother? I told you forget about him. The shelter is a big place! Chances are you\u2019re never going to have to interact with him again when we get there.\u201d\n\nLilith puts her bags down and walks over in an attempt to reassure you.\n\n\u201cCome on, you don\u2019t really want to stay here do you? Dangerous cannibals and criminal types, scavenging for sustenance, no proper toilets, I assure you Suzy at the GZ shelter you won\u2019t have to worry about any of that shit.\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGreat, ah damnit!\u201d Lilith suddenly remarks and puts her hand on her lower back.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. It\u2019s my back. Shit. I think all that damn running around, shooting, lifting and carrying heavy things took its toll. I really need to start exercising on a regular basis. Damn. (Sigh) I hate to ask, but could you carry my bags outside, you can just hand them to those two guards if you want.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure okay.\u201d You say.\n\nYou pick up the bags and head out the door with Lilith slowly walking behind.\n\nYou approach the two guards who are still standing on the porch and just as you\u2019re holding the bags out for them to take, you feel a sharp needle going into the side of your upper arm.\n\nYou drop the bags and turn around in horror, clutching your arm. Lilith once again holds a needle in her hand and you\u2019re soon feeling the affects.\n\n\u201cSorry Suzy, but this was the ONLY way GZ was going to let me take you. I never lied though; you will be given a position to contribute to the community. You\u2019ll continue to be a test subject\u2026though I\u2019m afraid it will involve a little more than just questions and some blood tests this time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d is all you manage to utter before you collapse on the ground and unconsciousness begins to take affect.\n\nYou can still hear some of the conversation as you start to pass out.\n\n\u201cCarry her to the truck and Leslie, you can carry my bags since your short temper nearly cost GZ a perfectly good subject.\u201d\n\u201cDunno why you just didn\u2019t take that bitch to begin with.\u201d Leslie remarks.\n\u201cBecause I wanted to see if she\u2019d ultimately go with what was easy or actually grow as a person and make the harder decision. She failed which is why she might as well be put in a GZ experiment lab. She\u2019s obviously not a learning animal, better her life goes towards something more useful.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re out for the remainder of the day, in fact you\u2019re out of it for quite a few days. By the time you wake up you\u2019re strapped to a surgical table with metal restraints with a lot medical equipment in the room. A bright light shines overhead.\n\nFear overwhelms every fiber of your being. You being to call out for help, but the group of masked doctors in a circle nearby don\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to be doing that.\n\n\u201cThe subject is up, chief.\u201d One of them says.\n\u201cYeah, I could tell by her screaming. Okay, let\u2019s get her started with the injections first, then I guess we\u2019ll see the reaction and go from there.\u201d The head doctor says.\n\u201cShould be interesting.\u201d Another says.\n\u201cMaybe. I\u2019m just glad we didn\u2019t get that asshole Leslie Morningstar assigned to our group. Dodged a bullet on that one. Let those fuckers in C Wing put up with him and his sister.\u201d\n\nYou panic, you struggle, you scream, you beg, you plead, you even call out for Bobby at one point, but none of it matters. The Ground Zero doctors begin to subject you to their experiments.\n\nYou have no idea how long this goes on for. Days, weeks, months? You never see Lilith or Leslie again and your world becomes to the surgical room to the observation room. You never see the rest of the Ground Zero facility.\n\nYour body is wracked with pain and goes through several ugly changes; your mind eventually becomes broken to the point of insanity though occasionally you have moments of clarity and that\u2019s probably when you\u2019re at your worst since you\u2019re practically wishing to die. Several times the doctors prevent you from killing yourself.\n\nThe doctors themselves don\u2019t really talk to you, but rather with each other like you\u2019re not even there. You do hear one mention in passing about the world being nuked, but that hardly matters given the torture you\u2019re being subjected to, indeed dying in a nuclear fire would be much kinder at this point.\n\nEventually through all their experimentation you become little more than a wild animal. Almost like what people back in town became, but even worse. It gets to a point where you actually manage to break what they thought to be strong enough shackles and kill three of the doctors experimenting on you.\n\nGround Zero security is called in and after enough bullets you are finally put down.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay at the house", "result": "Lilith\u2019s right. Your choice is simple.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t involve going somewhere with a pair of sociopaths and a shady corporation.\n\n\u201cSafest choice my firm ass it is.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nLilith\u2019s psychobabble about you might\u2019ve been a bit spot on in places, but it made you realize that not only is it not completely true, but that this past week you HAVE been making a concentrated effort to adapt to your surroundings.\n\nTrue, you haven\u2019t been successful at it for the most part, but you\u2019ve survived this long in this fucked up week, so you must not be too terrible at it either. Having to fend for yourself isn\u2019t fun, but then being alone isn\u2019t exactly new to you.\n\nIn any case, you still don\u2019t trust Lilith and begin looking around the house and there in the kitchen, you pick up a fairly large butcher knife. Actually it isn\u2019t a knife so much as it\u2019s a machete. One can only imagine what the hell it\u2019s doing in their kitchen, but you can take a guess.\n\nYou at first wonder if you should go try to kill Lilith or something, but then you think that probably isn\u2019t the best plan. It\u2019s likely to just end in your demise at the hands of her guards or her brother. You\u2019re not some close combat expert and despite what Lilith said about you possibly \u201cexploding into a ball of violent rage\u201d you actually don\u2019t have so much hate for her that you want to kill her without provocation. She actually might be telling the truth about the shelter as well rather than have any sinister intent.\n\nStill, you aren\u2019t ready to take that chance either. While she has said she\u2019ll just leave you in peace if decline the offer, you still have images of someone grabbing you, drugging you and taking you to the shelter against your will.\n\nSo that leaves one option. You\u2019re going to go hide. The question is where though. Lilith\u2019s upstairs, he brother is in the basement. You imagine if you hid somewhere on the ground floor, you\u2019d get discovered pretty quickly\u2026\n\nIt occurs to you, that you could just go out the backdoor and leave the premises for a while. You know they\u2019re still in a hurry to get the hell out of here, chances are, they are not going to spend a whole lot of time looking for you, let alone looking for you off the grounds of the house.\n\nSo that\u2019s what you do. You leave out the backdoor. Unfortunately the backyard has a high wooden fence so climbing it wouldn\u2019t be the easiest thing to do (And chopping it with the machete, would just cause noise) and the gate leading to the side of the house is locked.\n\nYou see a shed, but you imagine that\u2019s locked as well and it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be a good place to hide. There are a couple trees in the yard and that\u2019s when you notice that one of them has a few branches hanging over the fence.\n\nThe tree in question looks a lot easier to climb than the fence so you go up the tree which is slightly tricky with the machete still in your hand, but you soon make it to the branch you need to get to, drop the machete on the ground first and then drop down.\n\nAnd promptly land wrong and twist the hell out of your ankle as you crumple to the ground.\n\n\u201cFuck. Shit\u2026\u201d you start to curse until you stop yourself, when you hear a voice yelling on the other side of the fence.\n\n\u201cI dunno where your blonde lab rat is, go get your guards to look. I\u2019m trying to look for my favorite machete! I thought I had it in the kitchen, but it\u2019s not there. I\u2019m going to check the shed.\u201d\n\nFrom your low angle and through the slats of the fence you can see Leslie walking towards his shed. Definitely turning back now as you\u2019re most likely in possession of Leslie\u2019s favorite machete and you really hope that this isn\u2019t going to inspire a \u201chunt.\u201d\n\nYou crawl away from the fence and the house as fast as you can. The pain in your ankle makes standing to \u201climp away\u201d a bit more painful, but your desire to not get caught allows you to fight through it.\n\nThe high grass and the occasional bush or tree makes your escape into the \u201cwilderness\u201d slightly less nerve wracking since at least you aren\u2019t in a completely open field where if they were looking for you, you would be an easy find.\n\nJust as you think you\u2019re getting far enough away, you hear a voice call out your name in the distance. You freeze and turn your head to look behind you, but you don\u2019t see anyone. You still hear Lilith\u2019s voice shouting for you from far away, but you guess that she\u2019s just doing it from near the house rather than actively searching for you.\n\nEventually you cease hearing her call for you and you take a breather within a cluster of trees. Actually you think if you went any further, you\u2019d probably start going into a forest which you\u2019re prepared to do if you think anyone is actually going to come looking for you. For now though, you need to rest your ankle a bit.\n\nA few moments pass and you don\u2019t hear anything other than the occasional bird. A rabbit bounding nearby makes you jump a bit, but so far you don\u2019t think anyone is coming out this way to look for you.\n\nStill, you can\u2019t tell if they\u2019ve all left yet. You decide to be on the safe side, you\u2019ll wait a little longer. No more than that though since you really don\u2019t want to get caught out here in the dark.\n\nSo you wait, keeping your eyes and ears open. Really before now, you didn\u2019t realize how rural of an area you lived in. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever appreciated the outdoors before\u2026and you still don\u2019t now.\n\nTime passes and still no sign of anyone heading your way. You decide they\u2019ve probably left by now and it\u2019s probably safe.\n\nYou ankle feels slightly better, but it still aches. As you try to keep your weight off of it and make your way back to the house, you suddenly hear rustling noise in the trees and bushes nearby. At first you think it\u2019s another rabbit, but then you see exactly what it is\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you exclaim when you see a wild looking man with an equally wild look in his eyes. He sees you and makes that awful animalistic noise you heard while you were locked away in the basement and then sprints straight for you.\n\nFear grips you, but you know you can\u2019t outrun it with your ankle not being a hundred percent. Your only saving grace is you aren\u2019t completely defenseless.\n\nYou barely have time to react by the time it lunges upon you. You manage to swing your blade and as luck would have it you sink the blade across the thing\u2019s face while its mouth was wide open.\n\nYou weren\u2019t strong enough to cleave its head off, but it can\u2019t really bite you with a machete blade in the way either. Still, that doesn\u2019t stop it from tackling you to the ground, not to mention the blade is now stuck half way through its head and you couldn\u2019t really pull it out if you wanted to what with it being on top of you now.\n\nWith blood spray all over you and this thing still trying to kill you, you do the only thing you can think of: You push the flat edge of the blade on your side and the handle so the machete cuts deeper into the thing\u2019s head. It makes horrible squeals and shrieks, and keeps attempting to claw at your face, blood, teeth, bits of flesh are spraying/falling on you, but you keep the pressure on until at last you successfully shove the blade all the way through and the top of it\u2019s head come off.\n\nAfter a bit more struggling, you get the thing completely off of you as it still attempts to kill you in its death throes. The thing continues to twitch and you\u2019re busily looking around to make sure more of them aren\u2019t coming or if the Morningstars are still around and heard all the noise. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone else around though. By the way this thing was dressed he even looked like he might be a camper so hopefully it was just him in the woods.\n\nYou just realize you killed someone\u2026well someTHING at any rate. You don\u2019t feel bad, since it was more out of necessity. You get the impression you might be killing more of these things in the near future, so better you get used to it now.\n\nYou quicken your pace to the house though still proceeding cautiously as possible. You hug the back fence and slowly edge your way around to the front of the house and you see that the Ground Zero vehicle is gone, along with the two guards that were out front.\n\nAt least that\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t need to worry about.\n\nYou enter the house through the still open front door and check the ground floor and find nobody around. The place is still a mess though. You\u2019re about to check the upstairs when you see a piece of paper attached to the refrigerator with your name written in big black marker. You take it and read.\n\nSuzy,\n\nAssuming you came back here, I just want to say I understand why you ran off like you did and I probably wouldn\u2019t have completely trusted you if the roles were reversed. Still, it is a shame we didn\u2019t get to say a proper goodbye to each other. Leslie was quite angry with your theft of his favorite machete, but I talked him out of attempting to hunt you down for it. Not like we even need it where we\u2019re going.\n\nAnyway, I imagine you should have power in this house for a couple days at least. There is food and drink in the fridge and in the cupboards. You\u2019ll probably want to eat the stuff in the fridge first before the power goes out and spoilage occurs though.\nNot sure if you\u2019ll like some of it, but considering you liked the meatloaf, maybe you\u2019ll like what\u2019s in there.\n\nGood luck Suzy, I certainly hope your foray into being a survivalist is successful. I mean that. You\u2019re going to have to really push yourself and prepare for what is coming, but I think you\u2019ve got a shot.\n\nLilith Morningstar\n\nP.S.\n\nThe other patients are still locked in the rooms in the basement. There are four of them in total and have already very likely broken their restraints by now. As I have said before, the doors should be more than enough to contain them and you should be safe from them as long as you don\u2019t open the rooms.\n\nWell that was certainly a thoughtful note to you.\n\nYou sit down for a second thinking of what to do next. You thought that maybe you\u2019d try to barricade this house up and stay here, but now you\u2019re wondering if you shouldn\u2019t just leave considering you\u2019ve got four of those things clawing to get out of the basement. You to come to the conclusion that you might stay here another day tops and that\u2019s only to just search this place of anything useful and then you\u2019re heading out to well, you don\u2019t know where exactly, but you\u2019re going to continue to play this by ear.\n\nFor right now though, you really need to wash up. You\u2019re covered in blood, gore, dirt and generally feel really gross. You really don\u2019t want to use the shower in that room you were in during your time in the basement of this place though. You head upstairs in the hopes of finding another bathroom and sure enough you find one.\n\nLilith\u2019s clothes are a slightly bigger size, but you can\u2019t afford to be choosey since your own clothes are a bloody mess and it doesn\u2019t make much sense changing back into them.\n\nDuring all this, you continue to keep your wits about you. Still afraid that something may pop up to attack at any time. By the time you\u2019re out of the shower, night is beginning to fall.\n\nWhile you would\u2019ve liked to have gotten started on searching the house you\u2019re a little wary of turning on the lights in this house since it might very well attract more attention than you want. You do gather up a duffle bag that Lilith apparently decided not to use and plan to use that as your container for your search tomorrow.\n\nGiven that you\u2019re staying here the night, you need to secure this house as much as you can. You lock the back door and the basement door. (And trying to ignore the noises you hear coming from down there) You then shove a sofa in front of the ruined front door. It\u2019s not much, but if those things try to come in, you\u2019ll most likely hear it at least.\n\nYou also realize you haven\u2019t eaten all day, so you look in the fridge and grab something that looks similar to the meatloaf you ate yesterday since you don\u2019t feel like making a decision.\n\n\u201cHm, Lil and Les really liked their meatloaf I guess.\u201d You say and eat the stuff in the dark. (At least you don\u2019t need to look at it this time) Tastes okay.\n\nYou\u2019re up for quite awhile paranoid about every noise you hear. However, you know you can\u2019t stay awake all night despite your paranoia.\n\nYou head back upstairs to one of the bedrooms and close the door. You then shove a dresser in front of it. Best you can do.\n\nYou then flop down on the bed and reluctantly let sleep take you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a noisy vehicle outside. You waste no time in springing to your feet.\n\nYou cautiously peek out the window and see a beat up pick up truck pulling up behind Lilith\u2019s shot up vehicle. You then see two familiar figures get out of the truck with one of them speaking loud enough for you to hear even from your position.\n\n\u201cWoowee! Looks like we missed some shit going down around here! Make sure you keep yer eyes peeled! Thinkin\u2019 Doc might not even be alive anymore!\u201d Jed exclaims.\n\n\u201cShit. What the fuck are those two assholes doing here?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nYou see Hugo and Jed both carrying shotguns and going to the back of the pick up, which from your vantage point you can see a pile of blankets in the bed of the truck. Jed uncovers the blanket and reveals a naked woman tied up with ropes. She looks dirty, beaten and bloody. You can\u2019t quite tell if she\u2019s dead, but she\u2019s definitely unconscious.\n\nYou then see Jed say something to his brother and points to the house. Hugo nods and you see him walk out of your view. You temporarily freeze up when you hear a knock from downstairs. You hear it several times until you hear Jed shouting at his dim-witted brother.\n\n\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ Hugo, are ya stupider than usual today? Can\u2019t ya see that door is already hangin\u2019 off the fuckin\u2019 hinges? Just go in, and fuckin\u2019 check the place out, then let me know if Doc\u2019s even around or not. I\u2019ll be out here keepin\u2019 this fierce one entertained.\u201d Jed shouts and you see him patting the leg of the girl a couple times.\n\nThe knocking becomes a crashing sound as you hear Hugo bashing the door in and probably moving the sofa in the process. You turn your attention away from what\u2019s going on outside and how you\u2019re going to handle this situation.\n\nYou think about climbing out the window and on to the roof, but that\u2019s a risky proposition. Not really so much of the risk of falling (Though your ankle still hurts a bit) but more because Jed is practically in front of you and if he just bothers to till his head up or hears you, he\u2019s going to see you and probably open fire.\n\nYou look around the room and hoping maybe there is a firearm or something that Lilith didn\u2019t take, but you don\u2019t find anything. That dresser you put up against the door isn\u2019t going to last long if Hugo tries to come in here.\n\nYou suppose you could just try shoving move stuff against it, but considering he not only looks extremely strong, he\u2019s got a shotgun and could probably just blast his way through.\n\nYou hear Hugo stomping around downstairs.\n\nIf Hugo comes up here, and you hide in the closet, there\u2019s the possibility that you could get the drop on him as he walks in.\n\nYou wonder though if it might not be more advantageous to just head downstairs and try to sneak up on him now though. If he comes up and things go to shit, you aren\u2019t going to have any place to run to, especially if he traps you in this room.", "action_results": [{"action": "Seek out Hugo", "result": "Either way you\u2019re going to have to get the drop on him, better you have more places to run to, rather than just being trapped in one room.\n\nAs quietly as you can you move the dresser out of the way of the door and exit the bedroom. You still hear Hugo clomping around downstairs and you actually wait around the corner of the stairs hoping that maybe if he is heading upstairs you can ambush him that way.\n\nWaiting doesn\u2019t prove fruitful though and in fact you think Hugo\u2019s footsteps are actually getting fainter. It then occurs to you, he\u2019s probably looking for Leslie and Leslie would be down in the basement.\n\nYou cautiously head downstairs though you do it fairly quickly since the last thing you want is to be wrong and get caught going half way down the stairs while Hugo is going up them.\n\nAfter a quick look around on the ground floor and keeping your ears open you\u2019re not hearing or seeing Hugo down here. You are starting to hear Jed shouting from outside though. When you peek out the window, you can\u2019t quite see everything, but you notice Jed is clearly doing something with the woman that was in the back of the truck. You can guess what that might be given his movements and vulgar shouting.\n\nYou head towards the stairs of the basement and you nearly fall down them when you\u2019re startled by a sudden gunshot coming from down there. Hugo must\u2019ve just shot one of the four \u201cpatients\u201d down there. Of course it\u2019s hard to know if he\u2019d opened a door and killed one or perhaps it managed to get out on its own. Either way, you\u2019re going to have to be really careful.\n\nYou get to the basement floor and the noise of those things is much louder. You peek around the corner and down the corridor you see two doors to the rooms open. The closest one you know was yours, so nothing in there. The second one however looks like it also has a dead body lying partially in the entryway.\n\nYou see Hugo in the corridor opening up another door across the hall of the other two open ones. He isn\u2019t really paying much attention to your direction and when he steps into the other room, you make a dash for your old room and get inside.\n\nAlong with hearing the banging of the creatures still locked up, you hear another shotgun blast signifying Hugo\u2019s killed another one. You figure before he opens up the next door, you run up and chop him in the back of the head.\n\nYou peek out from behind the door and see Hugo exiting the room. He walks to the middle of the corridor and begins fiddling with his shotgun, as if he\u2019s having trouble with it.\n\nJust then the door across from him bursts open and one of the patients attacks him. You see and hear them struggle, growling, yelling, and everything else that comes with a life or death situation.\n\nIt gets more interesting however when you see Hugo drop the shotgun as he\u2019s struggling with the patient.\n\nYou waste no time and rush from your position to nab it. Hugo meanwhile is still struggling with the patient who has now bitten into Hugo\u2019s hand. You\u2019re about to put a hole in the pair of them and that\u2019s when the door to the room containing the last patient bursts open.\n\nThe thing seeing that one of its \u201cfellows\u201d is already struggling with Hugo, it screams and lunges forward to attack you instead.\n\nYou instinctively turn the shotgun towards the patient and pull the trigger, unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work which is why Hugo was fiddling with it earlier. It was jammed.\n\nBefore you can pick your machete back up to defend yourself, the thing has already tackled you. You struggle for a moment, but this one is a lot stronger than the one you fought with yesterday. It soon overpowers you and its teeth are ripping your throat out and its fingers are clawing your eyes out.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hide in this room", "result": "Better to stay put and surprise attack him that way. Quite frankly if you don\u2019t get the drop on him, you\u2019re probably not going to get the chance to run anyway.\n\nYou get the closet and hide in the extra niche space within it. Hugo comes kicking in the door, he wanders in and probably looks around the room first, and then you attack hoping you kill him before he shoots you.\n\nYou took out one of those rabid things by yourself and that was pretty dangerous right? You can do this. You can do this. You can do this.\n\nYou convince yourself as you wait in a closet to ambush a large and heavily armed retarded redneck rapist\u2026\n\nYou wait, still hearing Hugo clomping around and probably knocking shit over if the sounds are any indication. You also start hearing some shouting outside. You can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on, but you\u2019re more focused what\u2019s going on inside.\n\nAt any time, you expect to hear the sound of boots loudly stomping up the stairs, but you don\u2019t, in fact the sounds of Hugo\u2019s stomping get faint and soon you\u2019re not hearing it at all.\n\nAt first you think maybe he went back outside, but then it occurs to you that Jed told Hugo to look for Leslie. And if Leslie were here, he\u2019d probably be in the basement so that might be where Hugo went.\n\nYou cautiously come out of the closet and try to listen for Hugo, but the only thing you\u2019re hearing now is Jed making \u201cwhooping\u201d noises as well as shrieking. You peek out the window again just to see what the hell is going on.\n\nYou see the girl that was in the bed of the truck now bent over the tailgate and Jed raping her. Her arms are still tied behind her back, but she\u2019s not unconscious anymore. She\u2019s obviously squirming and making the shrieking sounds you heard before. Something isn\u2019t right though, and it\u2019s not just the whole rape thing. The noise that this woman is making doesn\u2019t entirely sound\u2026well \u201cnatural.\u201d\n\nYou think she might be one of those crazies. That doesn\u2019t seem to bother Jed however, he just keeps laughing and punches her in the back of the head every once in a while to \u201ccalm\u201d her. His shotgun is leaning up against the side of the truck. You guess he got over the idea of \u201ccatching\u201d something.\n\nYou shake your head at this fucked up situation and then suddenly you hear a shotgun blast from within the house.\n\nYou then remember there are still four of those things locked up in those rooms in the basement. You have no idea if Hugo\u2019s just opened up one of the doors and killed one, or they\u2019ve gotten out on their own though. You don\u2019t hear another gunshot, so you also don\u2019t know if he successfully killed it or it (or they) possibly got him.\n\nMeanwhile the shot briefly get Jed\u2019s attention and he actually stops raping for one minute, but then he quickly goes back to it and starts shouting at the crazed woman.\n\n\u201cHah! Sounds like my brother just put another one of you crazy bitches down!\u201d he exclaims and then slams her face into the bed of the truck.\n\nWell it seems like both brothers are suitably distracted and divided which is the best situation you\u2019re going to get.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019d take out Jed first and grab his shotgun. The only problem is there is no way you can really sneak up on him since his line of sight is directly in front of the house. Walking out the front door even quietly as possible and even with him in the middle of his rape of one of the rabid, if he sees you, it won\u2019t take him long to grab his shotgun and open fire.\n\nHugo on the other hand might very well already be dead for all you know. If he is, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean things are going to be any easier with one of those insane people or possibly more than one lurking around free in the basement. Even if he isn\u2019t dead, the same problem arises that you\u2019re going to have when you thought he might come up the stairs. Might even be harder given the corridors don\u2019t allow for many places to hide and he\u2019s going to be more alert now.\n\nWhether Hugo is alive or there are a group of cannibals eating him right now, you still feel like Jed would be easier for you to deal with armed only with a machete.\n\nYou move the dresser and cautiously leave the bedroom. You continually keep looking around as you head towards the stairs.\n\nYou make your way down the stairs and try to keep your head low so you don\u2019t possibly get seen through one of the broken windows.\n\nThe front door is wide open and you can see Jed with the girl. Right now he\u2019s got his head down and isn\u2019t paying attention to what could be in front of him, he\u2019s too busy slamming his dick into crazy woman and keeping her from getting away from him.\n\nAs quickly and as quietly as you can, you slip out the front door and hide behind one of the front porch pillars. You think if you\u2019re quick enough you could make it to hide behind the front Lilith\u2019s vehicle and then from there just crawl alongside that vehicle to Jed\u2019s vehicle, grab the shotgun and you\u2019re home free.\n\nYou peek around the pillar and see Jed\u2019s still engrossed in his activity. You immediately make the attempt\u2026\n\nThen another shotgun blast emanates from the house just as you\u2019re a the bottom of the front stairs causing you to stumble a bit and Jed to look up.\n\nYour eyes meet.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d pair of you shout and Jed starts fumbling with his dick and pants.\n\nYou MIGHT make it if you make a sprint to grab the shotgun, but then again you might not and not getting it, means game over.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably got a better chance if you run back into the house, but in that case you\u2019re going to be playing a game of cat and mouse with him and considering you just heard a second gunshot, it would seem Hugo is probably alive too.", "action_results": [{"action": "Run back in the house", "result": "You turn around and try to get back in the house as quick as you can.

Not only do you scream in agony, you also fall straight on you your face.\n\n\u201cStupid bitch, I told ya, to stop!\u201d Jed shouts.\n\nYou don\u2019t even look at your leg, but you sense that it may just be barely attached to the rest of your body at this point.

I SAID STOP FUCKING MOVING! Goddamnit\u2026\u201d you hear Jed shout and you expect to another shot, but instead you hear shouting of a different kind.\n\n\u201cARGH! FUCK!\u201d\n\nYou manage to turn your head enough to see Jed being attacked by the rabid woman he was violating. She\u2019s bitten him, but he\u2019s still managing to fight her off. You use this opportunity to continue to crawl away. You manage to get back inside, and you hear another gunshot followed by more swearing. Your heart sinks since that means Jed must still be alive.\n\nThe combination of fear and pain is clouding your thoughts of everything save for trying to get away, but you know that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nYour fears become reality when you\u2019re only half way up the stairs to the second floor and hear footsteps coming into the house.\n\n\u201cI hear ya whimpering girl and I can see the bloody mess yer leavin\u2019.

Didn\u2019t seem so sick out there when you were trying to reach for my shotgun. Bet you thought pullin\u2019 one over on me a couple days ago was really funny.

As you\u2019re dragged, you make one last ditch effort to fight, by twisting your body and swinging the machete you\u2019re still carrying in your hand.\n\nYou manage to catch Jed\u2019s arm sinking the blade in. He yells, lets go and falls backwards down the stairs. Unfortunately with his other hand that still holds the shotgun, he pulls the trigger on it.\n\nYou\u2019re hit again and it\u2019s a quick death as part of your head and brains are splattered all over the stairs and walls, which at least spares you of any further suffering.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run for the shotgun", "result": "You\u2019re going to be at a severe disadvantage if you run away, better to just get this over with and if you die today, then you die.\n\nIgnoring any pain you might still have with your ankle, you sprint for the shotgun.

Think your girlfriend is jealous.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWha\u2026AGH!\u201d Jed says and turns just in time for the crazed townie to bite Jed between the neck and shoulder.\n\nHe drops the shotgun and swings the machete in an attempt to kill the rabid woman. While they struggle you scramble and grab the shotgun.\n\nJed manages to fight off the rabid woman and finishes her off with a chop to her neck.\n\n\u201cAww, I was rooting for her.\u201d You say.\n\nJed turns around and sees you pointing the shotgun at him. He doesn\u2019t look scared.\n\n\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m scared because you\u2019re pointing a gun at me? Ain\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had one pointed at me blondie.\u201d He says.\n\u201cHeh, blondie now is it? Not whore, bitch, cunt, or whatever other unimaginative name you\u2019ve called me before?

The kickback hurts your arm, but it\u2019s a lot less pain than what you imagine Jed is feeling right now.\n\nJed howls on the ground in agony and you walk over near him.\n\n\u201cDid you actually expect I was going to fall for that like in a movie? Get me to check like an idiot and give you just enough time to possibly rush me? I just heard you rack this fucking shotgun not a few seconds ago. Not to mention with the time you spent playing with rabid girl over there, I would have had more than enough time to take the safety off and that\u2019s even if this particular shotgun HAD a safety feature on it to begin with which it doesn\u2019t!\u201d You say.\n\nJed just looks at you with a mixture of pain and disbelief that you would even know that much about a gun.\n\n\u201cI know, brains and beauty. It\u2019s a curse sometimes, but after this week I\u2019m starting to get the hang of it.\u201d You say and blast Jed into oblivion.\n\nThe first thing you do is keep an eye on your immediate surroundings. You, Jed and crazy woman made a hell of a lot of noise. Who knows what the hell might have been attracted. Not to mention the last thing you need is Hugo to have heard all of this and come running out. You seem to be okay for now though.\n\nThe second thing you do is search Jed\u2019s body or what\u2019s left of it for keys to the truck. It\u2019s a gory mess and the only thing you succeed in doing is getting your hands bloody. You do remember seeing Hugo getting out of the driver\u2019s side, so you imagine he\u2019s probably the one that has them.\n\n\u201cWell, he was going to be next anyway.\u201d you say and head back towards the house.\n\nOnce again you enter the house with caution. You get the feeling Hugo didn\u2019t hear anything outside or if he did, he\u2019s too pre-occupied with shit in the basement. Come to think of it, you haven\u2019t heard another blast and you know there are at least two more of those things down there, then again you\u2019ve been a little pre-occupied as well.\n\nYou make your way to the stairs leading to the basement. You aren\u2019t hearing anything at all, which makes all the more scary.\n\n\u201cMade it this far by yourself Suzy, you can finish this\u2026\u201d you say and descend.\n\nYou get to the bottom floor of the basement and just looking down the corridor, you see several of the doors are open. No sign of Hugo or the \u201cpatients\u201d though.\n\nYou head down the corridor fully ready for anything about to leap out at you. You look into the first room with the door open and see nothing. In fact, this is your old room.\n\nThe next two rooms obviously housed \u201cpatients.\u201d One of those patients is laying dead face down half in the doorway. The other is still in his room and hadn\u2019t even broken his restraints.\n\nYou notice the next room is empty, but the door looks like it was broken open from the inside. It would seem these rooms weren\u2019t as secure as Lilith thought. It is at this point you notice splatters of blood all over the floor and a trail of it leading to the last open door which again looks broken from the outside.\n\nYou slowly peek around the corner.\n\nThere you see one of the patients lying near the entryway with his head twisted all the way around and blood around his mouth. His teeth are clenched in a creepy death grin and you also notice the remnants of a couple fingers still gripped in it.\n\nIt would appear Hugo didn\u2019t get a chance to shoot this one.\n\nAnother patient lies further in the room with its brains bashed into the floor. It also has blood around it\u2019s mouth and in this case nails too.\n\nFinally you see Hugo sitting up against a wall with his shotgun nearby on the floor. He doesn\u2019t look so great though. He\u2019s clearly wounded very badly. It looks like he\u2019s holding his stomach, which he is bleeding out of and you already know he\u2019s lost some fingers.\n\nWhen he looks up at you. He doesn\u2019t even go for his gun, he just stares\u2026with one eye. He apparently lost one of those too.\n\n\u201cHUGO HURT BAD.\u201d He says.\n\nEither he doesn\u2019t recognize you, he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re a threat, or is too concerned about his injuries.\n\n\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201d You answer, Hugo still makes no move to the shotgun despite you walking in.\n\u201cYOU THE SICK PRETTY LADY.\u201d Hugo says finally recognizing you.\n\u201cYeah, well I got better.\u201d\n\u201cDOC CAN MAKE HUGO BETTER.\u201d\n\u201cDoc\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nHugo at this point winces in pain and coughs up some blood.\n\nHugo is just a retard; he probably doesn\u2019t even know he does bad things. You imagine his brother Jed has been manipulating him all his life.\n\nIt might even be tragic under normal circumstances.\n\n\u201cYOU SEE JED? JED MAKE HUGO BETTER.\u201d\n\u201cSure I\u2019ve seen him, I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d\n\nYou point the shotgun at Hugo who doesn\u2019t even really realize the gravity of the situation and with a mixture of avenging angel and angel of mercy you pull the trigger and put Hugo out of his misery.\n\nProbably quicker than he deserved, but it got the job done.\n\nYou exit the room feeling a bit drained. You weren\u2019t really expecting to do all this the first thing you got up this morning, but you handled it about as well as you could have.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much someone can change and what they\u2019re capable of within just a few days. You just killed two people this time and granted they deserved it, you still feel a little weird that you aren\u2019t sick about it or something. Maybe Lilith was right. Maybe you are capable of great violence without a second thought.\n\nThe jury is still out on that since as far you\u2019re concerned you haven\u2019t killed any innocent people, just two people who fucked with you. In any case you\u2019re a far cry from that \u201cgood girl\u201d who hid in the basement.\n\nSpeaking of basements, you decide to check out the rest of this one since you\u2019re down here. You don\u2019t find much though except one large room that is obviously where Leslie did all his \u201cexperiments.\u201d Looks like he took most of his stuff and left a couple of dead bodies on his table behind. You don\u2019t really stay long due to the smell, which is pretty awful.\n\nYou leave the basement with a second shotgun and Hugo\u2019s truck keys.\n\nYou spend the rest of the day looting the house for any potential worthwhile items. The Morningstars left surprisingly a lot of every useful items behind, but then again they\u2019re going to be in a nice safe shelter so there really wasn\u2019t any need you suppose.\n\nYou pack what bags you can find full of stuff until you feel you have enough. After doing that you take a break to wash up again and eat. You grab something out of the fridge that looks like lasagna.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t taste like any lasagna you\u2019ve ever had, but then again you\u2019ve only ever eaten the microwavable kind, so that might be why it tastes a hell of a lot better. Leslie might\u2019ve been a horrible human being, but damn if he wasn\u2019t a good cook.\n\nAs the sun starts to go down, you wonder if you should leave or stay one more night and leave in the morning. You ultimately decide now that you\u2019re a lot better armed, you can probably afford to stay one more night. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll get to sleep on a proper bed again.\n\nOnce again you take all the proper precautions of securing the house as much as you can and once again end with pushing the dresser to block the door of the bedroom before turning in to sleep.\n\nA little less reluctantly this time given that you have two shotguns and as well as a machete for protection now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next day\u2026", "result": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a noisy vehicle outside. You waste no time in springing to your feet.\n\nYou cautiously peek out the window and see a military truck pulling up behind Jed\u2019s vehicle.\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? Is fate just determined to make my life more hell than it needs to be?\u201d you say to yourself.\n\nYou then see a familiar figure getting out of the truck and carrying a rifle. He looks around and then wastes no time in running to the house.\n\n\u201cBobby?\u201d you say and then go move the dresser. By the time you\u2019ve gotten out the door, you hear him downstairs kicking over the sofa in the front door entryway and calling out your name.\n\n\u201cSUZY! SUZY!\u201d he shouts in a panic as you hear him knocking over shit in an effort to look for you.\n\u201cI\u2019m right here and you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s just me, because anyone else would\u2019ve long since blown your head off with the way you\u2019re announcing yourself by now.\u201d You say coming down the stairs.\n\nWhen you see Bobby, he definitely looks like he\u2019s seen better days, but when Bobby sees you he drops his weapon and his face is one of extreme elation. Like a great weight has been lifted off of him by seeing you. He rushes forward to presumably hug you and you immediately pull your own shotgun up.\n\n\u201cAlright, stop.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWha\u2026it\u2019s me! Bobby!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cYeah, I know who you are silly, I\u2019m just wondering WHY you\u2019re here. Who else is with you?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cNobody! It\u2019s just me! Suzy, just put the gun down, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, after the week I\u2019ve had I\u2019m not too fucking keen on just putting my weapon down. Besides we didn\u2019t part exactly on the best of terms or have you forgotten?\u201d\n\u201cI know! I know! I was an asshole about that! I didn\u2019t mean any of that shit I said! I was a big fucking asshole and you were right the whole time! I should\u2019ve realized sooner that you were always the one for me and that I should\u2019ve made the sacrifice for you because you\u2019re completely worth it and I still love you\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026what? You just realized this today?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I realized it soon after my aunt called telling me she had you over here.\u201d\n\u201cWait, didn\u2019t she call you on Tuesday? I was drugged and held against my will by your psycho aunt and uncle and you didn\u2019t think to come here sooner?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026it took me awhile to sort out my feelings\u2026I was still confused\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe this!\n\n\u201cTook you awhile to sort out your feelings?! Confused? Are you fucking kidding me?! That\u2019s your excuse?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no excuse! That\u2019s how it was! I thought there was no chance again with you given how bad we broke up! And besides, I\u2019m sure my aunt told you how I pleaded for your life. It\u2019s probably why you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay fine I\u2019ll give you that. Your groveling probably kept me alive initially, but if you REALLY wanted to come here and play white knight and save the damsel, you REALLY should\u2019ve got here fucking sooner! Do you even know what the fuck I\u2019ve had to deal with here for past three days?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I really did try to get here sooner! Seriously I did!\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, sorting out your feelings and probably getting one last fuck from Diana\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey! For your information I killed Diana.\u201d\n\nWell Bobby\u2019s peaked your interest enough that you lower your shotgun.\n\n\u201cWait, you killed that bitch?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t on purpose, but yeah I accidently killed her when I was trying to leave the compound. I told her to either the hell out of the way or I was going through that gate anyway. Never believed she wouldn\u2019t move and the crunch under the tires was pretty much an indication that I killed her.\u201d Bobby replies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly an accident Bobby, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s another point in your favor.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, I ended up getting held up in town by the fucking National Guard, when both of my cousins decided it would be a good idea to antagonize them even more by firing upon them. That went about as well as you\u2019d expect\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour cousins? You brought family with you?\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t exactly my idea. Two of my cousins, William and Aaron wanted to leave the compound as well, so they followed me for a while in William\u2019s vehicle. Then before I knew it, Aaron was firing at shit, which called more attention than it needed to. I parted company with them as soon as I could, but by that time I had the National Guard all over me. Crashed the vehicle and nearly got shot. In fact I probably would\u2019ve gotten shot had it not been for this tight ass government official insisting I be held for questioning. Thought I was a terrorist or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were held captive by the National Guard?\u201d\n\u201cWell I was on Wednesday and for part of Thursday until the camp got overrun by fucking crazy cannibals. Nearly getting eaten was a nice change of pace of getting punched in the face and beaten.\u201d\n\nWell that explains the bruises and scratches on Bobby\u2019s face and arms as well as the condition of his clothing, which is torn in several places.\n\n\u201cSpent the rest of Thursday just trying to get away from those fuckers and trying to make it through the town which was a warzone at this point. Wasn\u2019t until Friday night I managed to get a hold of a Guardsman\u2019s truck and drive out of there.\u201d\n\nYou remain silent as Bobby at this point walks over to you. He takes your hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get here sooner Suzy, I really wanted to and I really tried. My mind was always pre-occupied with concern of if you were even still alive or not. I can only imagine what horrors you had to face here. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened here, but I saw all the bodies outside and the state of the house\u2026and well I can guess you didn\u2019t have an easy time of it. I\u2019m here now though and you don\u2019t need to worry anymore. We can go anywhere you want. We can run away to anywhere just like you wanted. I\u2019m done with my family; I\u2019m done with my religion. From the moment I knew you were being held here, I knew YOU were my family. YOU were my religion and I love you so much. You have to believe me.\u201d\n\nYou look at Bobby and see in his eyes he really means all this. You stroke his face lovingly.\n\n\u201cOh Bobby\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then promptly slap him. He gives a surprised look.\n\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019re goddamn right you don\u2019t know what horrors I fucking faced! I was scared the entire time!\u201d\n\nYou go into an exaggerated tirade about what you experienced while you were here. Not that what you really went through wasn\u2019t bad, but to be honest it sounds like what Bobby went through was probably worse in his attempt to get here and you\u2019re not going to let Bobby just think he can waltz back into your life and get you back with ease with his \u201chero\u201d attempt.\n\n\u201c\u2026and did I mention I was nearly RAPED by rednecks several times?\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo they didn\u2019t, but I had to fend for myself and I did a pretty damn good job at it. Proved to me that I have an inner strength that I never took advantage of before and when the chips are down, I don\u2019t really need anyone.\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s face starts to show one of distress and just before he goes into his routine of telling you more honeyed words of his love for you and begs you to take him back, you stop him by continuing to speak.\n\n\u201c\u2026but there also were times where things would have been a lot easier had someone had been around to help me.\u201d\n\nNow you take Bobby\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Look Bobby, maybe all this crazy shit that\u2019s happened between us and to us is like wiping the slate clean or something. Maybe we do have a future. I believe you when you say you love me and obviously you went through a lot to try to get here to save me. But we can\u2019t just jump back into this like we were before. You\u2019re going to have to give me some time.\u201d\n\nBobby nods.\n\n\u201cOkay. I understand Suzy. I do.\u201d\n\nYou and Bobby just stare at each other for a while. It\u2019s funny how you never thought you\u2019d even see Bobby again, let alone reunite with him. Somehow the argument you had earlier in the week just doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s head upstairs to the bedroom.\u201d You say and pat his hand.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cFor sex duh.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSex? I thought you said you needed some time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I decided that some of that time involves pleasuring me. Besides, this isn\u2019t YOUR reward, it\u2019s MY fucking reward for surviving this shitty week. So I hope you\u2019re prepared to do a lot of licking.\u201d\n\u201cHey whatever you need.\u201d Bobby says following up the stairs.\n\nDoesn\u2019t take long for the pair of you to be totally into your reunification. In fact you\u2019re enjoying yourself so much you nearly don\u2019t notice the bright flash coming from the window and loud noise in the distance.\n\n\u201cShit that was bright, glad I wasn\u2019t looking directly at whatever that was.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about the light since my face was buried in your pussy at the time, I did hear the noise though.\u201d Bobby says.\n\nThe pair of you wander over to the window and in the far distance you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn\u2019t a big one.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026they finally went and did it.\u201d You say.\n\u201cLooks like.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cOh well, we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem very sure of that, I remember a time you would\u2019ve been worrying about radiation and everything else.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve been through this hellish week the same way I have and we both survived. Together I think our chances are even greater. Besides, your aunt told me GZ put drugs in the water that are supposed make people more resistant to radiation and disease and such.\u201d\n\u201cWhat seriously?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously. That drug is what also made most people go batshit crazy. Doesn\u2019t affect everyone though and I never did get a solid answer on why I wasn\u2019t affected. Guess you aren\u2019t either.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re already crazy?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d You chuckle.\n\nYou and Bobby go back to doing what you were doing and why the hell not? It isn\u2019t like the apocalypse isn\u2019t going to still be there.\n\nLater you Bobby load up his army truck with all the stuff you think you\u2019ll need. You aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019ll go yet, but you maintain a positive attitude that you\u2019ll ultimately be fine.\n\nAs he begins driving away from the house, you open up one of the Tupperware containers of food that you took with you when you left and start eating.\n\n\u201cWhat is that you\u2019re eating? It looks awful.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cI dunno. I think it\u2019s some sort of beef. I know it\u2019s not much for looks, but it tastes delicious though. Your uncle Leslie was a really good cook. I\u2019ve never been a big food person, but I\u2019m seriously going to miss eating from that house. I took this as a last hoorah as it were. You want some?\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s face begins to look a little concerned.\n\n\u201cSuzy, you\u2019ve been eating out of my aunt and uncle\u2019s fridge? How much have you eaten?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I\u2019ve had at least one meal a day there. What the hell else was I going to eat? I\u2019m telling you though I\u2019d like to know how to make this stuff, but I imagine just picking up meat from the super market isn\u2019t going to be an option anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOh you can make that stuff without needing a super market. Suzy, my aunt and uncle were fucking CANNIBALS! You\u2019ve probably been eating human meat for the past three days!\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\nYou stop eating and start looking at the meal you\u2019re eating. You poke at it a few times wondering if you\u2019re going to come across a finger or something, but after doing this for a few seconds you don\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary, and you scoop out another piece and eat it.\n\nBobby looks shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat? Still tastes good. Think of it this way, at least we know I\u2019m willing to eat human flesh if things get tough out here in the big bad apocalyptic wasteland. You sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d\n\nBobby just shakes his head and continues to drive.\n\n\u201cHm, more for me.\u201d You say with a shrug and take another bite.\n\n\u201cYou really have changed Suzy.\u201d Bobby remarks.\n\u201cYeah, well happens to the best of us.\u201d You say.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Love SICK Too\n\n\nThe Future\u2026\n\n\u201cYou know how mutants are dear, they act on impulse sometimes.\u201d You say as you sew up a shirt.\n\u201cYes, I get that, but I specifically told my congregation NOT to attack Iron Union transports! Last thing we need is the GZ corporation sniffing around this town asking questions. I\u2019m just glad I managed to convince them to clean up the mess, even if some of them were bitching the entire time.\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cHm, well you are very persuasive when you want to be. Guess that\u2019s why they listen to you at all.\u201d\n\nBobby just sits down in a nearby chair continuing to rant about the troubles with his \u201ccongregation.\u201d You\u2019ve heard the complaints before several times and really this is just a normal routine for you both. Bobby complains and you listen to his troubles. Just part of married life you suppose.\n\nMaking adjustments to accommodate your significant other\u2019s desires is another part of married life.\n\nBobby may have very well left his \u201creligion\u201d behind, but the cult leader part of him never really left him. You\u2019re not even exactly sure what \u201chigher power\u201d Bobby believes in now, if he does at all. Personally you think he just made up some shit and managed to convince a bunch of mutants to follow him. Not that you really care. He\u2019s bringing in the loot with his little band of brainwashed mutants and it provides him with a sense of fulfillment, despite the fact he\u2019s doing a lot of complaining right now.\n\n\u201cBobby, you\u2019re worrying too much again. I\u2019m sure your minions aren\u2019t the only mutants living in this town that have attacked Iron Union transports. Besides, last I heard the Iron Union is in the middle of a civil war. So even if they did find out, I doubt if they\u2019ve even got the firepower to launch an attack on a place that has the reputation of being a large and extremely dangerous mutant town.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, well they certainly got less now. There were some nice weapons in that transport.\u201d Bobby chuckles.\n\u201cSee? Just gotta look on the bright side of things.\u201d You say.\n\nMaintaining an optimistic mindset certainly came in handy during those early years when it was just you and Bobby surviving on the road, drifting from place to place. Not that it was all-bad and some of it was even fun, but you and Bobby were never truly happier when you finally managed to lay down roots here in Emberville.\n\nYou, of course for the reasons of comfort and security. Bobby of course still wanted a family. He had you of course, but you know deep down he still wanted to have children with you.\n\nWhich also became another adjustment, but really not one you were so resistant about anymore. You just needed time like you said and eventually you felt it was the right time.\n\n\u201cAlexander! Your shirt is done!\u201d you shout.\n\nYour son comes in from his room. Normally he\u2019s out playing, but there are times where he just shuts himself away and reads whatever books Bobby or you find for him. It\u2019s good that he has a variety of interests.\n\n\u201cHey this looks as good as new.\u201d He exclaims.\n\u201cI doubt that, but I did the best I could with what I had.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you learn to sew Mom?\u201d Alexander asks.\n\u201cOh, my mother taught me when I was little. Never thought I\u2019d actually ever take it up again though, but in this sort of world, it\u2019s sort of a handy skill to have.\u201d\n\u201cHey how come you never told me about that little interesting tidbit about your life when we were first going out? I remember being surprised when you told me you had seamstress skills\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cLike I said, I never thought it was important until this whole world went to shit and sewing up clothes was something I had to actually do more frequently.\u201d You answer.\n\n\u201cDid she teach you how to cook too?\u201d Alexander asks\n\u201cHah, no. I didn\u2019t learn how to do that until much later in life and I taught myself mostly.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYour mother is misremembering things again. She actually learned a lot from Mrs. Zerul down the street. Before we moved here, your mother\u2019s cooking probably nearly killed me more times than gunfire.\u201d Bobby jokes, which gets him a glare.\n\u201cHey, there were several times that we didn\u2019t starve thanks to me.\u201d You snap.\n\n\u201cWell I think you\u2019re a good cook Mom.\u201d Alexander remarks.\n\u201cThanks son, at least someone here appreciates me. Now go out and play and try not to ruin the shirt you\u2019re currently wearing. Especially if you play with that Jenny girl.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Jenny?\u201d Bobby asks, not knowing all of his son\u2019s friends as usual.\n\u201cJenny is a cute little mutant girl with talons instead of normal nails. Last time they were playing and Alexander came home with a shirt that was beyond my sewing skills.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure they were just playing?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cBobby!\u201d you say.\n\u201cHey, kids grow up fast without traditional social norms!\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cAnd what exactly would YOU even know what traditional social norms are?\u201d you ask.\n\u201c\u2026well I do know what they were even if I didn\u2019t actually practice them. In fact I\u2019d say I\u2019m a living example of what happens to a child growing up without traditional social norms.\u201d Bobby replies.\n\nAlexander isn\u2019t quite sure what you and Bobby going on about, but speaks up.\n\n\u201cMe and Jenny were just playing tag that time my shirt was all ripped up, like I said.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I remember and I believe you. Now off you go, and remember dinner will be ready just before night fall.\u201d\n\nAlexander agrees he\u2019ll be careful and runs out to play with his friends.\n\nYou watch him briefly from the door.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder if we shouldn\u2019t be a little more protective of him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Better he get some claw scratches and bruises now so he doesn\u2019t grow up to be completely sheltered.\u201d Bobby responds.\n\u201cYeah I know all too damn well what the dangers that can bring, especially with the way the world is now. Still, can\u2019t help but worry at times.\u201d\n\nBobby stands up and walks over to reassure you.\n\n\u201cWell of course you worry, you\u2019re a good mother. And here you always thought you wouldn\u2019t make a good one, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that was a whole other lifetime ago. I can honestly say I\u2019m glad those old days are behind us.\u201d\n\nBobby nods and begins to caress you. You return his affection with a kiss and the pair of you just sort of hold each other for awhile.\n\nSeems surreal at times that you arrived at this point. Married, a child, and living modest home in a town mainly consisting of mutants. Though given both your family and Bobby\u2019s, maybe it makes sense you fit in better with a community full of mutants.\n\nTo be honest, you think the only real problem you ever had with moving in and marrying Bobby to begin with was due to the situation with his sister Diana. You wonder if you would\u2019ve done all this sooner had she never been in the picture. Oh well, no point in playing \u201cWhat if\u201d especially since everything worked out.\n\nThis life is harder than your old one in several ways, but given all the new skills you learned and all of what you\u2019ve managed to achieve, you\u2019re definitely a stronger and better person now than you ever were before.\n\n\u201cWell I guess I better get started on dinner. Unless you want what Mrs. Zerul is serving down the street.\u201d You say elbowing Bobby in the side for his previous comment.\n\u201cOh yeah because hideous old women with humps on their back and scales on their face really do it for me. You know I was joking about that.\u201d\n\u201cI know. You brought the groceries right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just vegetables and meat though. Didn\u2019t get a hold of much else this time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all I ever really need. I know you\u2019re probably tired from getting the stuff last night, but can you help me get started?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cSure. Meet you in the kitchen.\u201d Bobby responds.\n\nBobby heads to the root cellar and you head to the kitchen when you start your preparations. You\u2019re lucky to have the kitchen amenities you have compared to most in this town. Wood burning stoves aren\u2019t that common here, but then again most mutants don\u2019t bother cooking their food at all. You and Bobby of course aren\u2019t savages.\n\nAs you\u2019re getting everything set, Bobby comes up with the groceries and sets them down on the large prep table.\n\n\u201cThere you go baby. You need me to help prep the meat?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I can do it. Doesn\u2019t take me long.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to get some sleep. Call me if you need anything.\u201d\n\u201cWill do. Thanks dear.\u201d You say and Bobby kisses you on the cheek before heading off to bedroom.\n\nYou grab your machete and stare at the table.\n\nThe tied and gagged naked young woman continues to squirm on the table. If she could, she\u2019d probably scream or beg. You\u2019re guessing she was part of whatever caravan Bobby and his congregation raided. Probably the merchant since she doesn\u2019t look like a guard. That\u2019s a good thing; her meat isn\u2019t going to be as tough.\n\nThis would be the other advantage of living in a mutant town: They don\u2019t frown upon cannibalism here.\n\nThe young woman\u2019s eyes widen as you bring the machete down to finish her off.\n\nAs you chop up the rest of the woman\u2019s body, you briefly think about the past again, specifically when Bobby\u2019s aunt was psychoanalyzing you.\n\nShe certainly was right when she said you were prone to revel in great violence under the right circumstances.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Beg", "result": "Antagonizing them even further isn\u2019t going to help; at this point you\u2019re better off trying to beg.\n\n\u201cJed, please. I\u2019d just like you both to leave. Lilith really doesn\u2019t want anyone here and I don\u2019t want anyone to get into trouble.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry blondie, ain\u2019t nobody gonna get into any trouble and ain\u2019t nobody gonna get hurt as long as you give in. Hey Hugo get yer big ass in here and, close that fucking door.\u201d Jed says and starts approaching you.\n\nThis is not a good situation. There is no way you\u2019re going to be able to fight off both of these redneck rapists. You don\u2019t even have a weapon and they\u2019re both bigger than you. You fear the inevitable as Jed is now standing in front of you.\n\nHe wastes no time in groping your body. Hugo however is still standing in front of the door staring like a gargoyle.\n\n\u201cAww, is little blondie scared? You don\u2019t need to be darlin\u2019. Like I said, me an\u2019 Hugo here are just gonna have us some fun an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be out of yer pretty little hair, well unless I cum in it.\u201d Jed laughs.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2026\u201d you start to say before Jed firmly grabs your chin with one of his dirty hands.\n\u201cNo. None of that blondie. The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she\u2019s giving head. An\u2019 since you seem to like having it open, you can get to doing just that.\u201d Jed says and then roughly shoves you to your knees.\n\nYou don\u2019t even look up, you just stare at Jed\u2019s crotch as he starts undoing his zipper because you don\u2019t even want to look at his fucking leering rape face.\n\nJed pulls out his cock and slaps you in the face with it.\n\n\u201cAlright, bitch get to suckin! Do a good job cause this is just the beginning and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re lookin\u2019 forward to what I got in store for that pretty little tight ass of yours!\u201d\n\nYou have no choice. This is happening and you\u2019ve gone beyond feeling scared and you\u2019re now feeling completely and utterly helpless.\n\nYou get started\u2026\n\nYour mind starts to go to another place. Or at least it tries to; the problem is Jed is so fucking repulsive in every way possible; you can\u2019t even at least begin to pretend he\u2019s Bobby or someone else. ANYONE else.\n\nJed is pushing your head and making all sorts of grunting noises and vulgar comments in general. It\u2019s without a doubt the worst feeling in the world and there really are no words to describe how horrible this is.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only going to get worse given the implications that Jed is going to rape you anally.\n\nWhile you\u2019re dwelling on this miserable situation, something in your mind begins to change. The fear is starting to dissipate and you\u2019re starting to get angry and you start to feel less helpless\u2026\n\nHis dick is in YOUR mouth. You\u2019ve got ALL the fucking power here.\n\nThis might be suicide, but you can\u2019t just let these assholes violate you anymore than they already have without a fight. You HAVE to do SOMETHING.\n\n\u201cHoly fucking shit, Hugo! Blondie here is fucking an amazing cocksucker! I think she\u2019s deep throated the whole\u2026ARGH!\u201d\n\nYou bite. You bite as hard as you can. Even with Jed punching at your head, you don\u2019t stop biting. You bring a whole new meaning to the phrase lockjaw.\n\nJed by this point is screaming on the floor for his brother to help him. Hugo attempts to pull you off, but all he\u2019s succeeding in doing is contributing to ripping his brother\u2019s dick off due to your firm bite on the now bloody member.\n\nYou keep grinding and gnashing and the fight is now going completely out of Jed who is now just howling in pain and screaming like a little girl. And at last you manage to bite through, blood fills your mouth and as Hugo pulls you away, you spit Jed\u2019s dick back at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the blowjob queen bitch!\u201d you shout and start laughing as blood drips from all over your mouth and face.\n\nIn between his screaming and holding where his dick once was, he orders Hugo to kill you. Hugo doesn\u2019t waste anytime in squeezing you tightly. You begin to have hard time breathing. Using the back your head you slam into his face several times and while you probably break his nose in the process, Hugo continues with his bear hug and you start to lose consciousness.\n\n\u201c(sob)Don\u2019t fucking knock her out, I said fucking kill that goddamn biting bitch! OWWW OHHH (sob) Break her goddamn neck!\u201d Jed screams.\n\nSuddenly the door opens up and you see an older man in a bloody lab coat. His hair is completely white and wild looking. This must be Leslie.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you two inbreds doing in here making all this fucking noise?! OH FUCK! You fucktards have really done it! I can\u2019t rely on you two for shit! Hugo drop that fucking bitch now!\u201d Leslie says and pulls a pistol out of his coat pocket.\n\u201c\u2026(sob) she bit my fuckin\u2019 dick off Doc! She\u2019s gotta die! OWWWWW OHHHH (Sob)\u201d Jed screams.\n\u201cYeah, well maybe she will, but this here\u2019s my sister\u2019s patient and you two just fucked with her results. Y\u2019know what, fuck this I\u2019m tired of reasoning with you two.\u201d The Leslie says and points the pistol at Jed.\n\n\u201cNow Hugo, you overgrown retard, you kill blondie there, your brother fucking eats a bullet. I can sew your brother\u2019s dick back on, but you gotta let that bitch go cause she\u2019s my sister\u2019s patient, not mine. Now what\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d\n\nHugo just looks on confused while still squeezing the life out of you.\n\n\u201cFUCKING JUST DROP THE BITCH HUGO! I NEED MY DICK!\u201d Jed cries.\n\nHugo finally understanding the situation drops you in a heap. You remain on the floor just coughing up dick blood and still trying to catch your breath.\n\n\u201cThank you. Now was that so hard?\u201d Leslie says and then calmly shoots Hugo in the head three times. The big man fortunately falls backwards rather than forward on to you.\n\n\u201cNOOOOO!\u201d Jed screams. \u201cWhat the fuck Doc?! You (Sob) killed my fucking brother! Why?!\u201d\n\u201cTold you, I was done reasoning with you two assholes. You have proven time and time again to be non-learning animals. Besides, Lilith\u2019s already gonna bitch at me for what you two fucktards did. Might as well do damage control now.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said you\u2019d sew my dick back on if that bitch lived!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not touching your fucking diseased dick.\u201d Leslie laughs.\n\u201cFuck you Doc! FUCK\u2026\u201d\n\nLeslie calmly places three rounds in Jed\u2019s head, putting the redneck out of his misery.\n\nYou just look on in complete shock at what just happened and try stand up. Leslie however kicks you back to the floor. You want to fight, but you\u2019re too weak at this point. Leslie pulls out a syringe and holds you down while stabbing you in the arm with it. Must be the same stuff his sister injected you with yesterday, because it works nearly immediately.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so blondie. Think you\u2019ve had enough action for one day.\u201d Leslie says as he strokes your hair.\n\n\u201cOh the fun I would have with you, but I guess what ultimately happens to you will be my sister\u2019s call. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll get lucky\u2026.SHIT!\u201d Leslie suddenly exclaims when he sees that you\u2019re not falling unconscious, but rather going into violent convulsions.\n\nLeslie begins to look through his other coat pocket and pulls out another syringe cursing when he sees it. Meanwhile you\u2019re spitting and coughing up blood. It feels like you can\u2019t breathe and that\u2019s mainly because you can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFUCK! I used the wrong syringe on the bitch! Fuck! Sis is gonna be even more pissed! Shit! Fuck!\u201d Leslies exclaims pacing back and forth.\n\nWhatever Leslie\u2019s concerns are about getting yelled at by his sister are nothing compared to the agony you\u2019re going through right now. Your insides feel like they\u2019re on fire and every major organ in your body is shutting down.\n\nBy the time Lilith gets back to your room, your poisoned bloody corpse, the bodies of two dead rednecks and Leslie\u2019s poor attempt to spin the event so it doesn\u2019t seem like it was his fault are all that remain.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Make an attempt to escape", "result": "You aren\u2019t going to stick around to be someone\u2019s lab rat only to probably get disposed of later.

You sit up, stretch and then make out like you\u2019re about to fall.\n\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d You say and Lilith quickly comes to your aid to prevent you from \u201cfalling.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, easy there, you o\u2026\u201d Lilith starts to say and then you elbow her in the face.\n\nLilith falls to the floor and you grab a particularly sadistic looking knife from the table. Lilith is remarkable quick to recover because by the time you\u2019ve done all this, she\u2019 already run to the door and opened it.\n\n\u201cLESLIE!\u201d she shouts before you manage to grab her hair and put the knife to her throat.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. I don\u2019t want to kill you, but I will to get out of here.\u201d You warn.\n\u201cThis was a very stupid thing to do Suzy. If you\u2019d cooperated you would\u2019ve gotten out of here in a few days at most. Now you\u2019ve sealed your own death certificate.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet! Now I\u2019m taking your vehicle, so I\u2019m going to need your keys. After I grab those I\u2019ll be leaving and if YOU cooperate you won\u2019t get hurt. So you better tell me where we\u2019re going and NOT shout for help again!\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine. I have my keys with me in my pocket. We just have to go to the vehicle. This way.\u201d Lilith says and the pair of you leave the room.\n\nYou constantly look around thinking you\u2019re going to see Lilith\u2019s brother coming around a corner, but so far nothing. Lilith tells you which way to go and eventually you\u2019re heading up the stairs. It\u2019s at this point Lilith starts talking shit again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away with this you know. My brother\u2019s going to stop you before you can escape and when that happens\u2026well you think things were going bad in your life before? You\u2019re going to soon learn that they\u2019re going to be infinitely worse.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well I haven\u2019t seen him yet. I guess he didn\u2019t hear you. Probably too busy with his experiments or whatever fucked up shit you two do here. Christ, your family is fucked up.\u201d\n\nLilith laughs.\n\n\u201cYes, and that apparently that didn\u2019t stop you from dating one of us.\u201d She says.\n\u201cThat was different!\u201d you snap.\n\u201cOf course it was. Extreme situations tend to create unusual pairings. Such as the one you and Bobby had. Although I think it was more unusual for him rather than for you given how much of a slave he is to some of my family\u2019s sillier traditions.\u201d\n\nYou get to the ground floor.\n\n\u201cBobby saved you like some damsel in distress from your mean old serial killer uncle. Makes sense you\u2019d latch on to him the way you did. In a way you\u2019re very much like one of those fairly tale princesses locked away in a tower, except in your case, you locked yourself away in your basement. Bobby was your Prince Charming.\u201d\n\nYou continue to ignore Lilith\u2019s ramblings.\n\n\u201cNow of course you still KNEW what Bobby was, but you willingly looked past that. Why? Was it love? No, even if you thought it was at first. If it was love you would\u2019ve married him in his compound instead of being here. Was it low self esteem? Possibly. But even as introverted as you are, you\u2019re still a very pretty girl and you have to know that on some level\u2026I mean even YOU aren\u2019t that stupid.\u201d\n\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention you seem to be fine by yourself. Even Bobby mentioned that you seemed to prefer your own company when you weren\u2019t with him. So where does that leave us Suzy? Why would you willingly date someone from a family as fucked up as ours? Do you know the answer?\u201d\n\u201cShut the hell up, I don\u2019t care! Just tell me where the front fucking door is!\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cNext two rooms to the right.\u201d\n\nLilith is quiet again and you make it to the front door. Still no sign of Leslie, so far so good. When you open the door, Lilith once again starts getting chatty.\n\n\u201cSince our time together is almost at an end, I guess I\u2019ll tell you the answer. You went with Bobby because deep down underneath all that apathy you\u2019re just as fucked up as the rest of us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even remotely true.\u201d\n\u201cOh, just because you were merely looking away from my nephew\u2019s murderous deeds, that somehow makes you less fucked up? That\u2019s classic enabling behavior, not to mention your co-dependency during your relationship with Bobby. Hell, before Bobby came into your life, you were pretty detached from the real world and lived in your own made up reality anyway. I\u2019d say under a different sort of extreme circumstance, you\u2019d easily turn into a killer like your uncle especially since from what I\u2019ve heard the rest of your own family isn\u2019t exactly well adjusted either. Didn\u2019t one of them kill his whole family before shooting himself?\u201d\n\nYou press the blade closer to Lilith\u2019s throat to the point that it draws blood.\n\n\u201cYou keep talking and you\u2019re going to find that THIS extreme situation is the one that turns me into my fucking uncle, so keep fucking talking and you\u2019re going to be the first fucking victim!\u201d\n\nYour threat finally shuts Lilith up.\n\nYou make your way to the truck, still looking around Leslie, but you don\u2019t see anything. Eventually you get to the truck.\n\n\u201cAlright, very slowly grab the keys out of your pocket. Drop them in my other hand and I\u2019ll release you.\u201d\n\nLilith complies with your orders and as soon as you have the keys you toss her to the ground hard. You then open up the door and suddenly feel a hand grab one of your upper ankles and then a sharp blade cutting into where the tendon would be. You scream out in pain and fall on the driveway pavement. Then another hand grabs your other ankle and you feel a blade cut into your other tendon. Meanwhile Lilith has recovered and taken away the knife you dropped. She stands over you while you scream in pain.\n\nAn older man with completely white and wild hair crawls out from under the truck. He wears a bloody lab coat and goes over to Lilith and asks if she\u2019s okay and remarks on her neck, she nods that she is fine.\n\nYou roll over and try to stand, but find it\u2019s quite impossible with your tendons sliced the way they are. You\u2019re bleeding all over the place and the fear of what\u2019s coming next is overwhelming your physical agony.\n\n\u201cTold you my brother would help me. I knew he would. He\u2019s my Prince Charming after all. Hm. I suppose because it\u2019s drilled into our heads when we\u2019re little that on some level we all like to be rescued. A big strong man charging in to save the day and all that chivalrous patriarchal nonsense, but on some level it\u2019s still sort of hot.\u201d Lilith says and then gives her brother a long kiss and hugs him.\n\nYou try to crawl away, since you can\u2019t even stand at this point, but you don\u2019t get far.\n\n\u201cToo bad nobody\u2019s going to rescue you now though. Should\u2019ve killed me instead of holding back\u2026but then that\u2019s always been your problem isn\u2019t it? Squandering your potential.\u201d You hear Lilith say and then what follows is a hefty kick to the back of your head. You black out.\n\nWhen you wake up you\u2019re firmly strapped to another table completely naked. This isn\u2019t a regular surgical table though since your legs are spread apart.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026no\u2026NO\u2026NO!\u201d you start to say and try to struggle free.\n\nYour voice calls attention to Leslie who was currently hovering over another body on a different table.\n\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re up. I wanted you to be before I started. My sister said it was imperative that you not be unconscious for whatever I have in store for you.\u201d\n\nYou start screaming for help in vain and Leslie goes over to you and starts stroking your head.\n\n\u201cNow she did suggest that one of the things I should do is hand you over to a couple of my redneck assistants and let them have fun with you, but no. After you harmed my sister\u2019s lovely neck with a blade, I think I should have ALL the honors. I\u2019m going to do things. Bad things and I\u2019m going to have fun doing it and nobody is going to stop me. We\u2019ll start off slow.\u201d Leslie says patting your head.\n\nYou begin to cry and for whatever reason in your grasp for hope in this hopeless situation you call out for Bobby.\n\n\u201cBobby?\u201d Leslie chuckles and then moves over to the part of the table where your legs are spread open and he gets between them while undoing his belt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not here to help you blondie. I will say that I\u2019ve never considered this before, but since this is a unique situation\u2026 is my dick bigger than my nephew\u2019s? I guess you can be the judge.\u201d\n\nWhat Leslie proceeds to do to you next is horrible and degrading.\n\nThen it gets worse.\n\nAnd worse.\n\nAnd worse.\n\nThe next day, what\u2019s left of you (which isn\u2019t much) is cooked and wrapped up for sandwiches. What isn\u2019t used for lunchmeat is tossed in the trash.\n\nAnd that is the story of you.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Decline the offer", "result": "You might not be in the best condition right now, but you\u2019re not going off with some stranger.

You really don\u2019t look well.\u201d The woman says.\n\u201cI said I\u2019m fine.\u201d You say starting to get agitated.\n\u201cAlright, alright, just trying to help. I\u2019ll go.\u201d The woman says and steps away.\n\nAs the woman goes back to her large black truck, you survey the immediate area and see that your accident isn\u2019t being paid much attention to. Other vehicles are merely driving by and nearby onlookers lose interest. You look over at the other vehicle on the far end of the street that slammed into you. The front end of that one is trashed and the driver has gone half way through the windshield. He\u2019s a bloody mess and isn\u2019t moving.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is get your bearings, because you don\u2019t even know where the hell you\u2019re at right now.\n\nYou walk away from your vehicle, nearly falling a couple times until you lean up against the side of a building. You really feel woozy. You\u2019re starting to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t have taken the woman up on her offer.\n\nYou try to ask a few people that are nearby where you are and they just brush you off. None of them offer to help you and one of them actually snarls like some sort of animal. The people in this town really have lost their damn minds.\n\nSince you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re at and you\u2019re not exactly thinking clearly, you employ a simple plan of just going in a straight direction until you start to recognize something. It\u2019s about all you can do at this point.\n\nAlong the way, you get to see up close just how bad the town is getting. And it\u2019s even scarier now that you\u2019re not even within the safety of a vehicle. You attempt to maintain a low profile and hasten your pace, but it\u2019s a little difficult to do since you\u2019re limping along.\n\nEventually you see a park a block ahead of you and instantly recognize it. It\u2019s actually the same place you met Bobby once upon a time. You sort of wish he was here right now.\n\n\nYou think you can make it to Julie\u2019s from the park, that would probably be your best bet since you were told the hospital was sort of screwed and going home is probably a longer walk. She\u2019s probably got more than enough painkillers there anyway.\n\nWith this new goal in mind, you press onwards toward the park thinking you just might make this after all.\n\nThen several gunshots ring out. You don\u2019t even know from what direction, you just duck behind a nearby-parked car.\n\nYou hear shouting and shooting. You peek your head up just enough to see three armed men in animal masks running towards your direction, but shooting in the other.\n\nYou duck your head back down when you see one catch a bullet to the head. From your cover, you hear another one cry out and the falling of a body.\n\nThe third one however jumps over the hood of the car you\u2019re hiding behind\u2026\n\nYou freeze as the bunny masked man stares directly at you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d He says and grabs you. You try to resist, but after a couple pistol-whips to your face, you become more limp and he picks you up.\n\n\u201cAlright! You pigs better not fuckin\u2019 shoot or I\u2019ll blow this yellow haired bitch\u2019s brains out.\u201d He shouts holding you up in front of him and pointing his pistol at your head.\n\nIn your blurry vision you can see several police officers in front of you with their weapons drawn.\n\nYou\u2019ve got the masked man shouting near your ear, the cops are shouting back and you just wish you weren\u2019t here anymore. The past few days have been just plain shitty and they\u2019re obviously not going to get any better. With your luck, you\u2019ll get shot and not even die right away because that\u2019s certainly how this week has been going.\n\nWell not if you can help it. You\u2019ve still got some control over your destiny.\n\n\u201cJust shoot the motherfucker.\u201d You utter and start squirming causing the criminal to start grabbing you tighter.\n\u201cShut the fuck up bitch!\u201d he shouts.\n\u201cJust shoot you fucking pigs! Look at this shithole town, do you think anyone\u2019s really going to question you if a civilian gets caught in the crossfire anymore? Just fucking shoot!\u201d\n\nThe cops at this point briefly look at each other and nod, they aren\u2019t even telling you to calm down. Maybe they already planned to just shoot anyway. Good.\n\n\u201cFuck this!\u201d the masked man shouts and starts firing on the cops, who return fire immediately.\n\nYou\u2019re hit several times during their shoot out with the masked man and finally something goes your way, you die instantly.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Stop Bobby", "result": "You might be Bobby\u2019s girlfriend, but you\u2019re not his fuck toy. You\u2019re not going to just give in because he happens to be horny right now.\n\n\u201cBobby, fucking STOP! Seriously! I\u2019m not in the mood!\u201d you say and pull yourself away from his arms.\n\nAt first he look hurt by your rejection, then his face turns to one of anger.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? I thought we were back together?!\u201d Bobby exclaims.\n\u201cExactly! We JUST got back together! I mean we got a lot of shit to talk about before we can just hop in the sack again!\u201d\n\u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kidding\u2026Suzy I just told you that you don\u2019t need to worry about Diana if that\u2019s what you\u2019re still on about!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about her, but that\u2019s certainly part of it. It\u2019s about not treating me like some glory hole because your dick\u2019s hard!\u201d\n\u201cSuzy, you know that\u2019s not even the fucking case. And since when are you not into me being affectionate with you? Shit, you were probably splittin\u2019 the kitten and thinking about me before I even came over here! Now maybe YOU can turn your feelings on and off, but I genuinely missed you! Excuse me if I want to express that in a physical way!\u201d\n\u201cBobby, I can\u2019t turn my feelings on and off, and this isn\u2019t one sided. I missed you too, but we still have things to work out before we can just continue as normal.\u201d\n\nAt this point Bobby rubs his hands over his face.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) You know what\u2026fine. I\u2019m not arguing with you. Play your little game. Let\u2019s just get your shit and get over to the compound.\u201d\n\nBobby\u2019s obviously mad about not getting any sex from you, but at least he isn\u2019t pointing out how you should \u201cgive it up\u201d because he\u2019s helping you out or something similar.\n\nBobby grabs some of your bags and you grab the rest and the pair of you leave out the front door. Bobby silently loads your bags in the van and the pair of you gets in equally as silent.\n\nYou break up the silence by mentioning how crazy the town seems as you drive through it. And it is pretty crazy. You\u2019re seeing police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and large groups of people fighting. This has to be the liveliest this town has ever been.\n\n\u201cWow, you weren\u2019t kidding about it being nuts out here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Bobby says.\n\nYou don\u2019t say anymore since it seems like he\u2019s content on sulking, but then he surprises you.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for being an aggressive asshole back there. I just got overly excited I guess.\u201d Bobby says.\n\u201cWell I suppose I can\u2019t blame you, I am pretty hot.\u201d You say which causes a smile between the both of you.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to say, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re helping me out by letting me move in with you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even mention it. I mean I would\u2019ve wanted you to move in sooner\u2026well anyway it\u2019s probably best we\u2019re doing this now. This compound is a lot bigger. You\u2019ll be happy to know you can have perfect solitude to yourself and not be bothered by anyone.\u201d\n\u201cNice.\u201d you respond.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re right, we probably do have a lot to talk about and we can do that and address all your concerns when we get there. We\u2019ll work everything out.\u201d Bobby says and smiles again with an optimistic tone.\n\nFor a moment there\u2019s another pause of silence and you think about how Bobby is a pretty great boyfriend in the scheme of things. So you come to a decision.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you want a blowjob?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bobby says being caught completely off guard.\n\u201cWell I can see from here you\u2019re fidgeting with your man parts every two seconds while driving. That either means you got some severe issues with your underwear or you\u2019re still horny.\u201d\n\u201cMy underwear is fine.\u201d\n\u201cWell that pretty much leaves one option. So you want one or not?\u201d\n\u201cI always want a blowjob, but now? I mean the streets are pretty fucking crazy right now and I\u2019m trying to concentrate on the road.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not concentrating completely on the road now, because you\u2019re still groping yourself.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat about all that stuff about not being a fuck toy?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cOh that was when you all over me, this is different because it\u2019s my idea.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not even going to argue with your female logic, I\u2019m just going to say yes.\u201d Bobby responds.\n\n\u201cSmart boy.\u201d You say with a smile and slowly slide over to Bobby and start unzipping his pants. Fortunately there\u2019s enough room for your head so you aren\u2019t going to be constantly hitting the back of it against the steering wheel.\n\nConsidering Bobby\u2019s pretty ready as soon as you pull it out, you get right to it and start doing what\u2026well one of the many things Bobby loves you for. You focus on the job at hand and you can hear Bobby making some sounds of enjoyment as you really start to get into it.\n\nAny other time, this probably would\u2019ve been a nice little thing for Bobby and probably a way for you to gain leverage in the next disagreement the pair of you would have inevitably had in a future about something. Blowjobs are the keystone to any successful relationship after all.\n\nHowever this probably wasn\u2019t the best time to showcase your dick sucking skills.\n\nAs you\u2019re deep throating Bobby into ecstasy, he\u2019s having an incredibly hard time paying as much attention to the road. Normally he probably wouldn\u2019t have been an issue in this normally sleepy town, but with as crazy as the streets are right now, he doesn\u2019t see the fire truck barreling down the side street and smashing right into his side\n\nBobby\u2019s van is hit with great force and actually topples over twice. In the process you end up biting Bobby\u2019s dick off and choking on it. Bobby is somewhat lucky in that he was knocked unconscious on impact, but he\u2019s not going to survive long due to several severe wounds and that\u2019s not even including his dick getting bit off.\n\nYou\u2019re also in no condition to even move now due to several broken bones, and your last moments are gasping for breath with a dismembered dick lodged in your throat.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}
