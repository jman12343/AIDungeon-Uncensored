From the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who walked there via land bridge, the Neolithic Men behind the ancient and amazing Newgrange, the Celts who soon popularized the country when it was known as Hibernia and from the Christians who spread after the return of Saint Patrick, who was enslaved by Irish pirates in his youth and endless Viking attacks, there's been a long history of pioneers and innovators creating a proud and noble nation.\n\n\nIrish history first has serious Anglo involvement in the Norman invasion of Ireland. Before then Ireland was simply a series of kingdoms and warring clans. The larger and more advanced Norman forces soon managed to conquer considerable sections of Ireland. However, rather than push for a full takeover, English focuses soon shifted, leaving a fortified area known as the Pale around Dublin under British control, with the rest mostly being allowed to survive under local rule. After this, there was a divide in power between the Gaelic Lords who could trace their origins back to the Celts who popularized the lands, and the Norman lords descended from those who sought to conquer the island.\n\n\nHowever, in 1536, Henry VII led an invasion of Ireland. Although there was brutal fighting as the Irish appealed to Catholic Spain for help, Ireland was soon conquered. Then, with a religious divide forming due to the birth of Protestantism, the issues first began arising. Using a system of land confiscation and colonization known as Plantation, English and Scottish Protestants were given Irish land to run, using the Irish Catholics as slaves. Although there were many brutal Irish rebellions such as the War of the Three Kings, which succeeded temporarily before the re-conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell, the Rebellion of 1641, which was fought over the division between Catholics and Protestants, and many more bloody and brutal rebellions, Ireland failed ot successfully regain control of its lands, and were treated as second class citizens by the Protestants who ruled over the country.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back", "result": "\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"\n\n\nA good quote, you think to yourself.

Unfortunately, at this point, it all turns to shit.\n\n\nCasement attempts to travel to Ireland via a German submarine, to meet with the other leaders. His plans were to convince them to call it off, as they didn't have the arms or manpower to succeed. Ironically, he was caught and arrested before he could do so, and imprisoned. In order to avoid setting off alarm bells, the Irish revolutionaries made no attempt to rescue him, focusing on the upcoming rising. \n\n\nIn Easter, 1916, the rising began, but it was doomed to fail from the beginning. Disputes among the Irish volunteers meant that only a fraction of the members showed up for the rising, with the rest staying home. Little over twelve hundred Irish men fought, against a thousand British Royal Constabularies, and sixteen thousand British troops. There was a lot of early success, with the rebels securing key points of the city, but when the British reacted with full force, even sailing a gunboat up the river Liffey to shell the city, they were forced to surrender to avoid more civilian causalities for a lost cause.\n\n\nThe rebels counted sixty six brave Irish men among the dead. The British lost a hundred and forty three. Of course, they combined were less than half the dead. No, the true losers were the civilians, poor Irish men and women like yourself, like your family. Two hundred and sixty men were killed, with thousands more being injured.\n\n\nCasement was executed for treason, along with sixteen of the main leaders of the uprising. One of the men, James Connolly, was so wounded by the fighting he couldn't even stand for the firing squad. They had to prop him up in a chair before the firing squad could finish him off. Casement wasn't even given the honor of a soldier's death. After his knighthood was taken away, he was hung like a dog, like a common criminal, like only an Irishman ever is.\n\n\nOver the next six months, the reaction to this changes, surprisingly. While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn't even take into account Britain's indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising. Just as Padraig Pearse wanted, his men didn't achieve a tactical victory, but have become painted as martyrs for a cause, gaining huge support and lighting the fire of patriotism in the soul of every Irishman there.\n\n\nThen, the British saw fit to execute the sixteen key figures of the rising: P\u00e1draic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael O'Hanrahan, Willie Pearse, John MacBride, Eamonn Ceantt, Michael Mallin, Sean Heuston, Con Colbert, Thomas Kent, S\u00e9an MacDiarmada and James Connolly.\n\n\nThese executions further made the British seem as oppressors rather than peace-keepers. Some of those executed weren't even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn't been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn't participated in it. The manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad. Joseph Plunkett married his wife Grace Gifford, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism, seven hours before his execution. They weren't allowed to speak to each other or touch each other. He was shot later that day.\n\n\nStories like this quickly turned public support in favor of the rebels. Support for Sinn F\u00e9in, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this. With Sinn F\u00e9in rising into power, republicanism on the rise and a desperate longing for independence arising in the Irish zeitgeist, it seems clear that violence is coming. \n\n\nYou, however?

If the convoy had even two or three men, they'll always outnumber whatever gunman's attacking. Once they run into the first, they can eliminate him or fall back. No, the ideal system we have, like the one used at the Soloheadbeg Ambush, is to have a primary body at the ambush point. They attack in superior numbers, wiping out the enemy, but if the enemy, try to blow on straight through and drive on, have two more men further up ahead to eliminate the drivers if they try to escape. That's the system we go with.\"\n\n\nThe soldiers all nod thoughtfully, as you nod as well.\n\n\n\"That's the tactic we're going to use to deal with the RIC convoy we're going to be raiding.

Apparently, Michael Collins has made quite a reputation for himself in Frongoch, and now as the Minister of Finance of D\u00e1il Eireann, a commander of the IRA, and director of information, he's a very powerful man. He controls vast networks of informants, and a near mystical group of assassins known as the Squad, or the Twelve Disciples, that hunt down spies and informants as well as performing assassinations.\n\n\n\"We're going to hit them to fully arm this group. Until then, we're using weapons borrowed from Liam Lynch and the No. 2 Cork Brigade. We're going to hit in the formation discussed, and wipe out the convoy. I'll be taking the ten best shots here, so let's get to work and show me what you can do.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the day is spent drilling and going over tactics, as well as O'Malley and the locals establishing the various levels fo support held for them among all the various locals.

The locations of various RIC barracks and where the presence of the British army is strongest, as well as the area that this branch was expected to deal with, a large section of outer and rural Dublin.

The two of you quickly head to Cork, where you meet with the leaders of the IRA forces down there: Liam Lynch, Tom Barry and Sean O'Donoghue. They organize a room down with another IRA volunteer by the name of Brenda. In exchange for helping out with the farm, you get free room and board from him. You quickly get involved with the IRA down there, organizing drilling, training and ambushes alongside the vast rebel forces down there.\n\n\nFor the battle of independence, the war gets worst, especially for Cork. In March, the Mayor of Cork is murdered by a group of Black and Tans.  In response to increased internment, Munster and Cork get especially violent. 24 prisoners of war are hung by the British, and Sean Tracey, the man who started this all, is killed in Dublin. In August, Terence MacSwiney, the new Mayor of Cork, dies on a hunger strike, attracting vast international attention.\n\n\nWhen November rolls around, the violence only continues. On the 21st, Bloody Sunday happens. Michael Collins and the Squad, his anti-spy squad, assassinate 14 undercover British Intelligence officers in a single day. In a reprisal attack, the British forces attack a Dublin v Tipperary football match, killing indiscriminately, killing twelve people including one of the goalies. Two prisoners of war and an innocent man are executed at Dublin Castle in addition to this, purely as acts of spite against the entire Irish people. This event is known as Bloody Sunday.\n\n\nIt's late November now, only a few days after Bloody Sunday and you're down in Cork. You sit in a small room Brendan's farmhouse in Cork, discussing matters with a group of other IRA soldiers. Liam Lynch, a small, bespectacled man you'd normally look over, stands at the center of attention, commanding the entire group.\n\n\n\"We're low on arms, low on manpower and all-around we're doing worse than we can. Fighting this war is going to be tough,\" Liam Lynch admits.\n\n\n\"If we quiet down on the ambushes and go underground while doubling our recruitment efforts, we can make up our numbers in no times,\" Tom Barry, a young commander with a mess of black hair suggests.\n\n\n\"Not a chance in hell, Tom. If we reduce attacks, the British will think they can quash out the rebellion here. If they subdue Munster, if they take Cork, this rebellion will falter here as badly as in Ulster. Connaught will be a mop up, and with that, their focus on Dublin will wipe us out completely.\"\n\n\n\"Then what do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"We attack. We double-down, and hit hard and fast. Make sure those Brits understand that this isn't going to be easy for them. I've already lined up two targets. Tom, I want you to head to Kilmichael shortly, to set up an ambush. It'll happen a week after the Sunday Massacre. You're to hit a group of Auxiliaries, around eighteen men. I'll give you twice that. I want this group blown out of the fucking water. Make sure the Brits know who is fighting this war.\"\n\n\n\"Aye. There'll be no survivors,\" Tom Barry nods.\n\n\nThe plan for Kilmichael actually represents a serious change in the IRA method of waging war. Rather than small, occasional ambushes from locals, the IRA has began organizing flying columns of soldiers, permanently mobile units of soldiers that stay at various safehouses to rest and resupply to avoid capture, while hitting hard, aggressive attacks. It's a show of total war, thanks to the escalation in violence the Black and Tans caused.\n\n\n\"The second ambush I'm planning is a bit more distant. In early December, I plan to capture or kill Army Intelligence Corps Captain James Kelly, to put a face to this slaughter. A simple six man unit hits their lorry, killing their men with grenades and sweeping through the survivors with rifle.

We'll be free,\" Joseph says.\n\n\nLiam Lynch nods, looking down at his notes.\n\n\n\"Good, good. Or...

Shortly after, negotiations begin between the Republican Government and the British government. President of D\u00e1il Eireann, Eamon DeValera, visits London four times, before finally a delegation is sent over for negotiations.\n\n\nNegotiating for Britain was Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Lord Chancelor Lord Birkenhead, Leader of the House of Commons Austen Chamberlain, Secrety of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Attorney General Sir Gordon Hewart and Chief Secretary for Ireland Sir Hamar Greenwood.\n\n\nOn the Irish side, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and famed nationalist politician Arthur Griffith is chairman, accompanied by Secretary of Finance and military general Michael Collins, Secretary for Economic Affairs Robert Barton, and two Members of British Parliament and members of D\u00e1il Eireann, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy.\n\n\nStrangely, President of D\u00e1il Eamon DeValera chooses not to attend. Although reasons were not given, there's rumors that he knew whatever deal the Irish delegation could manage to argue for would certainly be far less than wanted, and he wanted someone to pin the blame on. \n\n\nThe negotiations are long and hard. The Anglo-Irish Treaty is devised, but it involves both sides sacrificing quite a bit. The Irish delegation refuses to sign it without consulting DeValera and the D\u00e1il. Eventually, under threat of taking the two countries to war again, a final ultimatum is made: sign the treaty, or continue the war. With little choice, the delegation takes the former option. \n\n\nThe Treaty was a long, complicated document, but the main things were these: Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland. Ireland was to become a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, similar to Australia, Canada or South Africa. The British King would be the Head of State of the new state, known as the Irish Free State, or Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann. The new free state's parliament would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State. The more Protestant, Unionist Northern Ireland would would withdraw from the Free State, becoming it's own dominion of Britain with it's own parliament. Britain would control a number of Treaty Ports in Ireland. Ireland would draft it's own constitution giving it power of itself, but Britain would decide it's policies in terms of foreign affairs and war.\n\n\nThe treaty was met with a mixed bag. In many ways, it was far more than anyone had dreamed of before 1916. On the other hand, the idea of a free, independent Irish Republic was what many men had fought for, and was what many men had died for. Many saw it as a betrayal of principle to bow down to the crown after what they'd done. \n\n\nThere's along debate in the D\u00e1il, with Eamon DeValera leading the anti-Treaty side.

There's a stand off between O'Malley and 800 of his anti-treaty IRA and 700 pro-Treaty IRA men under Michael Brennan over who will take over the military barracks in Cork after British soldiers abandoned it, which ends peacefully, thankfully, after the barracks is divided between pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces.

You're positioned outside the Four Courts, ready to defend the Free State if these traitors make an attack.\n\n\nIn May, anti-Treaty soldiers take over the center of Kilkenny, before being dislodged by 200 Free State soldiers.

The election takes place, with pro-Treaty parties far outdoing anti-treaty parties. Sir Henry Hughes Wilson is assassinated in Britain, although whether it's by anti-Treaty IRA soldiers or a secret assassination by Michael Collins and the Free State is debated, due to Sir Hughes Wilson being an almost universally hated figure among Irish for his treatment of Irish citizens in the war.

Due to the fractured nature of the IRA, many continue fighting despite the ceasefire, although the violence is hugely decreased, and you personally don't see any action against these remaining groups. Then, Frank Aiken gives the order. \"Dump arms, and return home\". It's that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. With that, your enemy is defeated.

Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war.\n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation. Two political parties rise up from Sinn F\u00e9in, known as Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael, the former made up of anti-Treaty politicians, the latter pro-Treaty politicians.

The Statute of Westminster is signed, which gives Ireland substantial power in the United Kingdom. Through political maneuvering, the power of the British over the Free State is diminished, until the statute is used to overturn the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and Ireland succeeds from the UK, becoming the Republic of Ireland. It's a joyous day, but you can't help but feel bitter that the man who waged a war that got heroes like Michael Collins killed would end up later using the political methods to gain freedom like Collins had suggested. \n\n\nAs a free, independent nation, Ireland prospers.

Mary and Arthur help raise them with you, as you serve as a favorite uncle to their child, who never learns the unfortunate circumstances of his conception. Ma passes, as with all things, and time goes on. \n\n\nThe first child you name Joseph. It seems like a fitting name for the boy, who has the same stubbornness that Joseph held, as you come to find out. The second, a daughter, is named Saoirse, the Irish word for freedom. It seems fitting, after all you struggled for. \n\n\nIt's a summer day, as you walk through the seats at a football match, leading your children along to see Ireland play France. You can't wait to watch the match, even though the kids are far more into it than you. Well, Saoirse is. Joseph is just along for the ride, and it's good to get his head out of the books.

Well, you are, but that's not what brings tears to your eyes. You didn't fight for a colored flag or a catchy tune.

Poverty was rampant under British rule, as the rich took advantage of the poor. Food was actually shipped out of Ireland during the Great Famine, where a million lives were snuffed out, and a million more souls being forced to emigrate. To this day, the Irish population hasn't recovered to its pre-Famine numbers.\n\n\nThe troubles in Northern Ireland would eventually lessen as religious divides were cast aside. To this day, these tensions still exist, however. Still, the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, has improved greatly, to the point where they're tied to the hip economically and culturally.\n\n\nIn the end, there was a struggle between ideas, with heroes on both sides. In the Easter Rising, there were simple soldiers and policemen trying to keep order at home while there comrades fought the Germans across the seas, and Irish patriots desperate to free and liberate their country. In the War of Independence, although there were certainly many abusive and oppressive figures on the side of Britain, there were also many soldiers just performing their duty to keep order and PTSD-stricken veterans who were making a living the only way they could, with people trying to free their country and end a long, painful oppression. In the Treaty War, there were those who wanted peace, who were willing to go with pragmatism and take what they could, versus those who felt betrayed by their country and wanted to free their independence, a goal so many of their friends had been given for. Even in later years, with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, there was just those trying to protect their newfound country and their cultural identity, versus men who still considered themselves as soldiers in the war of independence, forgotten by the greater nation as they tried to end British rule and the oppression of Catholics.\n\n\nIn the end, there were victors and victims, but thankfully, the bloodshed could come to an end, and independence could be achieved peacefully.\n\n\nHopefully, you've enjoyed the story of a nation at war with itself, of brothers fighting brothers, of conflict, loss and passion.

The IRA forces are desperate for peace, hoping they'll simply survive as it becomes clear there's little chance of success. Frank Aiken, who you know quite well at this point, is elected to the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, becoming the anti-Treaty commander.

It's that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. Eamon DeValera supports this move, sending out the following message: \"Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic\". It's a spiteful message, sure, but an order of surrender. \n\n\nIt isn't a major battle that ends the war, not a decisive victory or some great battle. No, it's a bunch of old friends growing tired of shedding each other's blood, or killing civilians, or executing prisoners.

The Free State treats the anti-treaty rebels surprisingly well, and they're released after sometime.

Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war. \n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation. Two political parties rise up from Sinn F\u00e9in, known as Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael, the former made up of anti-Treaty politicians, the latter pro-Treaty politicians. These parties are joined by Sinn F\u00e9in, which becomes a more old-fashioned party focused mainly on the joining of Northern Ireland to the Republic, but of course, more parties rise up, such as Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats and many more. \n\n\nHowever, it's not long before Fianna Fail is voted in, with Eamon DeValera taking power. The Statute of Westminster is signed, which gives Ireland substantial power in the United Kingdom. Through political maneuvering, the power of the British over the Free State is diminished, until the statute is used to overturn the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and Ireland succeeds from the UK, becoming the Republic of Ireland.

Your wife, Fiona, passes, unfortunately, although the relationship was never that... romantic, to say the least. Mary and Arthur help raise them with you, as you become a favorite uncle to their boy, who never learns the unfortunate circumstances of his conception. Joseph helps out as well, of course, but he's busy settling down with his own family, a pair of kids of his own, twins named Rory, after the late Rory O'Connor, and Cathal, after the late Cahthal Brugha.

Well, you are, but that's not what brings tears to your eyes. You didn't fight for a colored flag or a catchy tune.

You leave the captured Free State soldiers in the cells they once imprisoned your comrades. With that, you begin a slow, nervous evacuation of the town, retreating to the countryside where you can disperse and escape with your captured spoils. As you sit in the passenger seat of a truck laden with captured rifles, you nervously wait, terrified of the Free State going against their word and attacking, which with the element of surprise and the use of artillery, they could easily wipe you out. Thankfully, though they make no such attempt, and you quickly escape out. \n\n\n\"A successful operation,\" Frank Aiken says. \"Thank god for this.
