Maybe you could talk to the director to make changes since they also wrote it. I\u2019m sure you and her are familiar with each other.

All flash and nothing to back it up. (Though you don\u2019t mind looking at the young females that are there) That\u2019s why they hang out in packs. You never did that even when you were young.

I\u2019m also glad to see you\u2019re still as anti-social as usual Wolf.\u201d Mary says as you finally get off of your misguided heckler and approach her. She still looks the same, though she looks a lot better now that she got rid of that hair style she used to have and dyed it blonde.\n\u201cJust re-establishing the proper hierarchy, nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, always the Alpha Male, that was what I always loved about you. So primal. Maybe later I can dress in a little red cloak and we can reenact a fairy tale.\u201d\n\u201cSome fairy tale, as I remember you loved a lot of beings.\u201d\n\u201cHey I can\u2019t help who I am. I was created this way.\u201d\n\u201cJust like Frankie eh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you compare me to that sicko! Yes we are controlled by our genetics to a certain degree, but as you damn well know I rose above them! I made my own identity. I\u2019m a successful director and writer now, so what if I have a healthy sexual appetite? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree given all the beings you had your way with before, after and DURING your marriage!\u201d\n\u201cLook never mind all that.

It makes a mockery of werewolves! You even named one of them fucking Benji!\u201d\n\u201cWell comedy is popular now.

In most horror movies you\u2019ve made you always got killed in the end by a human, how was that any less demeaning?\u201d\n\u201cBecause at least I was portrayed as feared monster that killed a bunch of people!

You wouldn\u2019t have had to put up with his \u201cchildren\u201d taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker.

She\u2019s dressed in a short leather skirt and a tight white t-shirt that\u2019s tied in the center and has long flowing brown hair. You can smell that she\u2019s in heat. You hate to coin a pun, but she literally is one hot l\u2019il bitch.\n\n\u201cErm, not you. You stay in your human form; I kind of like the whole teenage slut look you got going on. In fact you come here right now; you\u2019ll be traveling on my bike with me.\u201d You say.\n\nAs she slides in behind you and holds on, you ask her one more question.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cGinger.

It seems Victor has been keeping himself very busy in recent years.\n\nAs it begins to rain, a familiar voice calls to you from one of the towers.\n\n\u201cIts you. Vic always knew you\u2019d return one day. I never believed him though. I guess I owe him fifty bucks.\u201d\n\nYou look up and see Igor, he looks different too. He has a lot of clumsy cybernetic implants, one of them being some sort of gun in place of an arm. More of Vic\u2019s \u201chandy work\u201d no doubt. He\u2019s still got that damn hump on his back though.\n\n\u201cIgor? You still alive? I thought your ungrateful master would\u2019ve just let you die of old age and get himself another assistant.

All you can think is, he better have something better than just Igor and Frankie defending him.\n\nAs you prowl around in the courtyard, you hear moaning and the clomping of several footsteps.

These things look more like Frankie, except designed even worse. A lot of them have arms and legs in odd places. Some have a couple of heads or extra limbs. Most aren\u2019t even stitched together neatly, there are just giant rivets and spikes sticking out, holding them together.

Mary\u2019s little movie is made purely for exploitation, but its GOOD exploitation. It\u2019ll show everyone who we are and that we\u2019re NOT to be fucked with! This isn\u2019t some shitty family movie. This is raw footage of werewolves doing what they do best, kicking ass! We couldn\u2019t ask for better publicity.

This is weird, there aren\u2019t even any guards patrolling or even at the door. In fact it sounds like a party is going on inside. You hear lots of laughter and music.

Wow, I didn\u2019t know any of you types were invited to the party; I thought Drac hated you guys. Well what\u2019re you doing standing outside?

You entrance to the ballroom is immediately a big event. You\u2019re the only Werewolf there. Everyone else is either a Vampire, a ghoul, or even a human \u201cservant\u201d. Everyone is staring at you, some with wonder and interest, most with hatred, a few in awe. Most probably haven\u2019t encountered a Werewolf like you before. The staring would probably continue if another slightly out of place being didn\u2019t come shuffling up to you to talk you in a friendly manner causing the bloodsuckers to go back to partying. It\u2019s Im-Ho-Tep. You\u2019re surprised to see him here.\n\n\u201cWolf?! YOU got an invitation to this thing? I can\u2019t believe it!

Oh you know Vlad, he\u2019s always gotta put on a show. Likes to play up the whole royalty thing to the other bloodsuckers, so he always invites me to these things to prove he\u2019s got connections or something since I was a Prince. I always keep telling him, it\u2019s a meaningless title since the Egyptian Empire fell thousands of years ago, but he insists on flying me out here, making a big fuss and everything so what the hell, it\u2019s not like I got anything better to do plus I get a kick out of watching the bloodsuckers get drunk and make idiots out of themselves, well that and I like to look at some of these Vamp chicks. Heh, guess that makes me a voyeur, but again what the hell, its one of the few pleasures I get in this world anymore.

You\u2019re still the craziest sonofabitch I know, but then you always did know how to liven up a party! Ha ha! Ol\u2019 Vlad will probably be making his grand entrance soon, so just wait awhile. He threw this party for some kind of special announcement he has to make. I still got a bet with Erik that you would win if you and Drac ever got into a battle to the death.
