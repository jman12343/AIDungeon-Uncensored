When the world ended countless years ago, you were old enough to possess memories of your old life but too young to yet be set in the ways of the old world. Because of this, you had the upper hand both physically and mentally during the first few dreadful years after the apocalypse, but the real credit goes to your older brother. He taught you everything you needed to know about surviving on the road, and he always had your back. You don't travel with him anymore. In fact, you can't even recall when you last saw him, or where he went. You never try to remember though\u2014your brain repressed that memory for a reason, and you don't care to find out why.\n\n\nYou're bundled up tightly in a shirt, jacket, snow pants, and hiking boots. You've tied a cloth around your face to keep the ashes out of your lungs.

You know that it would be reckless to keep moving in the black of night, so you resolve to camp out and try your luck at sleep.

If I were to get caught in a snowstorm out there, I'd never find my way back.", "result": "With confidence that you've made the right decision, you park your cart in the ashes beside the road and hurriedly collect firewood, staying as close to the road as possible. Lighter in hand, the dry twigs catch instantly, and you sit back and watch the flames spark and crackle before you. A distant memory starts to surface, but the ashes in your mind make the image appear blurry, and you can barely make out a pair of tiny feet warming in front of a fireplace. You quickly push the thought from your brain and take a swig of water from your canteen. Bitter, but refreshing.

Gathering up your provisions, you place them back into the cart and begin on your way south.\n\n\nAfter having walked almost five miles, you come across what used to be a bridge spanning a wide river. The rapids may have raced along the channel at one point in time, but now the thick sludge only creeps slowly over the rocks.

You drop them onto the ground and your feet and struggle to catch your breath, then glance over your shoulder. The cart's still there, standing firm against the current.

Starvation is making you dizzy, and before you know it, you're lying face down in the ash and snow.\n\n\nNo, you can't let it end like this. You have to get up and keep moving.

Your older brother, and that old name of his you'd almost forgotten. The bridge. The blur. The content smile before the final CRACK. He'd wanted you to come with him.

The charred trees around you don't offer as much protection as you'd like, but it's better than being completely exposed and vulnerable. You put your supplies down and set out to search for firewood, but by the time you return, there's barely enough light to see by, and you nearly trip over your backpack in the pitch dark. Muttering under your breath, you begin working to start the fire, but your frustration gets the better of you and you lay down in defeat.\n\n\nPulling a rusty can of peaches from your pack, you quickly scarf down your dinner and toss the trash to the side.
