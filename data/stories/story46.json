There will be separate sections for boys and girls for as we all know, both genders experience different struggles during their precious formative years.\n\nIf you are a pre-pubescent, you should NOT be reading this story, you should be in bed. Such mature subject matter is not for your tender young eyes.\n\nIf you are an adult and you are a parent, perhaps you should \u201cexperience\u201d this story with your teen, for they may still have further questions about the subject matter. Questions that you should provide answer for, because if you do not they may learn the wrong answers from their peers, the streets, minorities or even (gasp) the evil dirty internet!\n\nIf you are an adult and NOT a parent, get the fuck out of here. You probably just want to \u201cplay\u201d the girl path and choose all the slutty choices, you fucking pervert.\n\nIt is the hope that this story may somehow help teens better deal with the problems found in this story in real life. And remember if you do turn out to be gay (boys) or sexually loose (girls) it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.

You\u2019ll probably get cut and then you\u2019ll be back where you started and you don\u2019t want that.\n\nWhile you\u2019re sitting in the locker room wondering what the hell you\u2019re going to do, one of your team mates approaches you.\n\n\u201cHey, I saw you out there, you looked pretty good.\u201d\n\nImmediately you go on the defensive.\n\n\u201cHey, hey!

Due to you breaking another member\u2019s leg in training, the coach doesn\u2019t hesitate to allow you on the team. As the weeks go by, you start pumping a lot of iron and have muscles like you never had before and certainly a lot more confidence. Your awkwardness with girls has ended and after a few winning games your popularity has grown. You are now a \u201csomebody\u201d.\n\nHey steroid freak, don\u2019t celebrate just yet, now you get to see how much you fuck up!\n\nYou\u2019re continual abuse of steroids has increased your aggression to an unnatural degree, at one point you get angry at someone in one your classmates and smash his face into a bloody fucking pulp. It takes the teacher and a couple of your classmates to keep you from killing the poor sonofabitch. Fortunately for you, since you\u2019re so \u201cnecessary\u201d to win the next game, you get off with just suspension from school for three days. During this time you attend a party (Your parents don\u2019t dare try to stop you) where you hook up with some chick.\n\nYou and her start making out and then once again you start getting aggressive, she tells you to stop which only makes you angrier so you bitch slap her to the floor and start ripping her clothes off. While you attempt rape, you come across a big problem which is that the steroids have shrunk your balls and made you impotent. Now you\u2019re even MORE pissed, so you just start beating the poor girl and blaming her for your own problems eventually breaking her neck. You aren\u2019t done yet though, as you\u2019re insistent on still trying to get your limp dick hard even after her body has expelled all its fluids from the \u201cdeath release\u201d. At this point some other people from the party enter the room and see this grisly sight.\n\nWhen they all shout \u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d you instinctively realize you need to get the fuck out of here, so you jump out the window and land wrong twisting your ankle badly, but you pop some painkillers and start running.\n\nYou don\u2019t get far when a cop car attempts to stop you, but when the cops get out you charge into the first one and break both of his arms before he can even draw his gun, the second cop shoots you twice, but you don\u2019t even feel it and you grab him by the throat and rip out his larynx, then you flip the car over crushing the other cop lying on the ground in pain with broken arms.\n\nMore cops come and seeing what you\u2019ve done they don\u2019t take any chances and just blaze away at you with shotguns blowing big chunks of meat out of you finally putting an end to your \u2018roid rage as well as your life. Fortunately you didn\u2019t really feel anything since you were still flying on painkillers at the time.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nDon\u2019t do steroids they make your nuts shrink and cause impotence. And let\u2019s be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter how many cops you can kill with your bare hands, you just aren\u2019t a man if you\u2019re unable to rape a woman, shrinky dink!\n\nAnd now you know!", "action_results": []}, {"action": "No!

You have no problem now screaming obscenities and nonsensical words into the microphone at the top of your lungs. After a few more songs (and a few more beers) you even start making up some words yourself and some minor theatrics. Zack and the rest are pleased with your display.\n\n\u201cYeah, you might work out. We\u2019re playing at a party this weekend, do some crazier shit and I think we\u2019ll rock the fuckin\u2019 house!\u201d\n\u201cWill there be (hic!) beer?\u201d\n\u201cDuh, of course it\u2019s a party.\u201d\n\u201cCool.\u201d\n\nYou stumble home in a buzzed state. You\u2019d probably get in trouble, but your own parents are currently fucking their brains out while on the sauce themselves so you manage to sneak in and avoid any lecture. For the rest of the week you become more and more acquainted with the joys of alcohol, A LOT. As it turns out, you\u2019re one of those people that can drink and drink and not pass out right away. Guess you have Mom and Dad\u2019s genes to thank for that. They finally came through for you.\n\nWhen you arrive to sing at the party, you immediately let the rest of the band members set up the equipment while you just drink in the meantime. By the time it\u2019s ready to go on you\u2019re already three sheets to the wind, and puke all over the place, but gosh darn it, that\u2019s just part of the act! ALL the rock stars do it! At last you\u2019re finally cool!\n\nRock stars tend to do a lot of drugs too; while at the party someone offers you a ton of unknown pills which you greedily swallow.

In fact she\u2019s the school skank that everyone\u2019s fucked in one way or another (Well except YOU of course) she was impressed by how you managed to vomit in tune with the \u201cmusic\u201d, in fact she\u2019s so impressed by you, she takes you upstairs and fucks you eight ways from Sunday. Mind you this could also be dangerous considering you didn\u2019t use any protection and this girl probably has a snatch as sanitary as an inbred hillbilly\u2019s outhouse in the summer during a heat wave whose owner has chronic explosive diarrhea.\n\nAfter your encounter with \u201cMiss Friendly\u201d you decide in your drunken state that you should probably go home, because it would be the responsible thing to do. (Nevermind the fact that you were supposed to do another set which you\u2019ve completely forgotten about) So you get in your parent\u2019s car that you \u201cborrowed\u201d and begin to drive home\u2026\n\nOkay you DO realize how dangerous that is right?\n\nNo of course not, you\u2019re an indestructible \u201crock star\u201d.\n\nAnyway, you end up driving in the wrong direction and eventually drive into buttfuck farm country getting yourself totally lost. Speaking of buttfucking, you barely stop in time to notice a cow is in your way, at which point you get out of the car and\u2026uh\u2026for some odd reason, fucking that skank wasn\u2019t enough for you\u2026\n\nThe next day a farmer finds you passed out next to his poor defiled cow with your pants around your ankles and your dick covered in cow shit and jizz. After beating the hell out of you he takes you to the authorities.\n\nTo cut a long story shorter. You never live down the shame of fucking a cow in the ass and become the laughing stock of the town. You also get put in a mental institution where you become even more depressed when a perverse orderly molests you every night. Eventually you put yourself out of your misery by drinking bleach kept in the janitor\u2019s closet.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nYeah, the rock life style is filled with alcoholism, drug abuse and irresponsible sex practices, but nobody tells you that it can lead to fucking a cow in the ass and cleaning product suicides.\n\nNot so \u201ccool\u201d now is it, cow fucker?\n\nAnd now you know!", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Join a gang!

Out of drugs, alcohol, sex or even food, you could\u2019ve abused to \u201cescape pain\u201d, you thought the best thing to go do was jamming a fucking sharp ass razor into your skin until you bled all over the place?\n\nPhysical pain is never a good thing, unless it\u2019s some sort of S&M sex, but that\u2019s a different story and different moral.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to insist on cutting yourself, at least have the minor intelligence to keep the goddamn razor sterilized!\n\nAnd now you know!", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Seek attention from others", "result": "Seeking attention isn\u2019t quite as easy as it may seem, if it was you wouldn\u2019t be in the situation you are in now.

You\u2019re more than a little disappointed.\n\n\u201cUm, so are you like my girlfriend now or something?\u201d the guy asks, to which you just pull up your panties, fix your dress and leave.\n\nYou go through a similar thing with three more guys that day, and they all vary in ability, but you at least get some pleasure out this. Hell, you don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t do this in the first place.\n\nThe next day everyone\u2019s heard about your escapades and while all the guys are certainly hanging after you now, you\u2019re very surprised when some girls pull you aside in the bathroom.

You can\u2019t just be giving it up like that and encroaching on OUR territory! Prepare for a serious beat down bitch!\u201d\n\nNot wishing to fight, you attempt to talk your way out of it. You notice a lot of them wear some very colorful jewelry so you comment on that.\n\n\u201cHey, uh those are some very pretty earrings you got.\u201d\n\u201cWhat these purple polka dot ones? Got them after I blew six guys within five minutes! And this green striped bracelet? Got that for taking two dicks in the ass at the same fucking time! This jewelry ain\u2019t just for fuckin\u2019 show, it\u2019s to represent! You betta recognize!\u201d\n\u201cWow, I wish I had some.\u201d\n\u201cOhh? So you want to join us? Maybe something can be worked out then. But I question whether you can REALLY hack it. I mean if you join us, you gotta be willingly to do shit, that you might not have ever thought about doing before, and fucking some little dicks in an empty classroom ain\u2019t gonna cut it. You gotta be ready to do some really freaky shit.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m ready!\u201d you say confidently.\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll see. Meet me at my house and we\u2019ll have an initiation, and I\u2019d save your energy for tonight. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\nYou take Ashley\u2019s advice and keep your legs closed today much to the chagrin of all the guys who were hoping for a quick fuck. When you get over to Ashley\u2019s house you\u2019re met by her, her posse and a bunch of guys. They all look much older than high school boys, probably college.\n\n\u201cSo is this one Ashley? The one that wants to be a wild party girl?\u201d one of the guys\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think we can show her a good time\u2026\u201d another one says as he grabs your ass.\n\u201cUh, you guys aren\u2019t going to hurt me are you?\u201d you say getting nervous.\n\u201cIs this chick for real? Ha ha ha ha!\u201d\n\u201cHey! You wanna be down or what bitch?\u201d Ashley says getting in your face.\n\u201cOkay, okay, but I just don\u2019t wanna get raped.\u201d\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Ashley, I don\u2019t need a rape accusation from yet ANOTHER under age girl who changes her goddamn mind at the last minute! You realize how pissed off my Dad was at me after he spent all the money on high priced lawyers? Fuck this, I\u2019m leaving. I can fuck some half drunk college girl for a lot less trouble.\u201d One of them says and walks off.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m still game!\u201d the one still rubbing your ass says.\n\nAfter some debate and whining, you finally agree to take the four remaining guys, but only if some of the girls are there with you. One of the girls agrees since she needs to do a few extra things to pick up her spiraled turquoise necklace accomplishment. The six of you go into Ashley\u2019s pool house and begin to get down to business. As it turns out, the guys aren\u2019t all that rough like you thought they might be, in fact they\u2019re downright boring. Its YOU who has to insist on different positions. Eventually after you\u2019ve been fucked in all three holes and have cum all over your face, you also dyke it out the other girl, which gives the guys an extra bonus show and you an extra piece of jewelry!\n\nAt last you\u2019re part of something, and \u201cpopular\u201d. You feel so fulfilled, but of course this is only temporary. You always feel empty. Even when you got your plaid toe ring for engaging in\u2026well it\u2019s too long to list here, but even after you did that you still felt empty. So naturally you continue to seek attention by fucking countless strangers and not so strangers.\n\nThen comes the day when you don\u2019t feel so empty, you realize after all this hedonistic immoral behavior that you\u2019ve come down with a couple of venereal diseases and you\u2019re pregnant on top of all of it. You\u2019re more upset about being pregnant though since it\u2019ll really put a cramp in your fucking time. You\u2019re almost about to bite the bullet and go to your parent\u2019s about it who never notice anything unless you address it, but Ashley tells you that she can take care of it.\n\n\u201cShit, we take care of our own. We can do an abortion easy, we\u2019ve done it before; my dad\u2019s a doctor so he\u2019s got all kinds of medical books around. I can get you some penicillin for that gonorrhea on your lip too.\u201d\n\nYou somewhat breathe a sigh of relief even if you are a little nervous. She tells you to meet her after school and she\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nAfter school, you head over to Ashley\u2019s where she shouts and tells you to come into the pool house. When you enter, you\u2019re suddenly punched very hard in the stomach where you fall to the floor. The other girls proceed to kick the shit out of your stomach until its pretty much a given that they\u2019ve destroyed whatever life was forming in there as you miscarry all over the floor as well as coughing up blood.\n\n\u201cOh shit! We should\u2019ve done the coat hanger thing instead!\u2019 Ashley shouts.\n\u201cOh Daddy why couldn\u2019t you have just loved me?\u201d you whimper before you die of blood loss and internal bleeding.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nDon\u2019t be a goddamn fuck slut, nobody respects them and they always wind up in a bad situation. You traded away your dignity just for a few minutes of pleasure and attention and look what it got you, dead. And a dead whore isn\u2019t mourned, since there\u2019s always another right around the corner. (Or on the corner)\n\nBesides don\u2019t you know that whores are often the number one target of serial killers?

Way to be a clich\u00e9.\n\nYour next step is to start chatting with all the people that have suddenly made friends with you and begin giving more personal information about yourself while they all say how they have the same problems you do. At last you\u2019ve found people you can relate to, and some of them are cute teenage boys! You can\u2019t believe they\u2019re all interested in you. In fact a lot of them want to know where you live so they can meet you in person. You comply; in fact you agree to met one guy calling himself Kittylover. He says he uses that name because he likes young\u2026cats and obviously any guy into cats is a sensitive soul. Fortunately he lives only a few miles away from your town!\n\nAnd that would be \u201cstupid things you can do on the internet\u201d number two. At this point is it really even necessary to continue? You know this isn\u2019t going to end well.\n\nBut anyway you invite Kittylover over while your parents are away at one of their swinger\u2019s parties. When he comes over naturally he doesn\u2019t look anything like his picture, but then again you didn\u2019t use the worst picture of yourself either, so you give him the benefit of the doubt and let him in...\n\nAnyway, you and Jacob (as you find out his real name is) talk briefly before he tells you he just got his driver\u2019s license and his parents didn\u2019t want him driving here by himself, so they\u2019re outside waiting in the car and he was hoping they could meet your parents as well, but you say they aren\u2019t here.\n\n\u201cOh? Well can they just meet you then?\u201d\n\nYou agree and then Jacob invites his parents in\u2026\n\nSo anyway, you get to know Jacob\u2019s parent\u2019s a little better and they find that you are a fine young lady that\u2019s good enough to go with their son. They go on about how worried they were at first that you might be some sicko, or something.\n\nAs all four of you talk, this has turned out better than you could\u2019ve imagined, you\u2019ve gained a new boyfriend who seems to like you a lot AND his parents like you. Sure you live a bit far from each other, but you can work that out.\n\nSuddenly your parents come home, you didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be back so soon, but this will be great, they can meet Jacob\u2019s parents and\u2026\n\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S THE MAN WHO MOLESTED ME BACK IN BIBLE CAMP!\u201d Jacob\u2019s father screams in horror.\n\u201cHuh? What? Who are you?\u201d your Dad stutters.\n\nWhile Jacob\u2019s father screams and cries about the sexual abuse your Dad did to him when they apparently were at Bible Camp together in the past, your Dad protests his innocence. Well actually he doesn\u2019t, he says\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, I was just trying some stuff out. I found out I liked girls better. And we were like ten years old!

Jacob\u2019s mom just stands there screaming. You attempt to calm everyone down, but fail.\n\n\u201cYou and your family ARE a bunch of sickos!\u201d Jacob cries and pulls away from you when you try to reason with him.\n\nSoon your mom comes down with the gun and starts yelling and unfortunately you get in the way of your Mom attempting to defend her man and catch a bullet in the head.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nPretty simple one actually\u2026 DON\u2019T FUCKING MEET PEOPLE YOU MET OVER THE GODDAMN INTERNET!\n\nNothing ever good comes of it.

(Sigh) Look, I know it\u2019s fucked up, but that\u2019s how we do, alright? It\u2019s what keeps our marriage together.\u201d\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re so unhappy why don\u2019t you two get divorced?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your mother thinks she\u2019ll burn in hell if she gets divorced\u2026yet she doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with getting fucked by three strangers in one night, go figure. As for me, well I\u2019m just plain stupid, because somewhere within me, I still desire your mother and besides she ain\u2019t getting half of shit! I\u2019ll kill all of us before I allow that to happen. So we swing. It\u2019s not perfect, but it works for us...still we probably should pay more attention to you, so today\u2019s your lucky day, I\u2019ll spend all the time you want with you.\u201d\n\u201cUm, you will?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I ain't got shit else to do today except nurse this hang over, so what\u2019s on your mind and keep your voice low.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t exactly picture this event happening this way, but at this point you\u2019re grateful for the attention, so you tell your Dad about all the things going on in your life, which really isn\u2019t much since you don\u2019t have one. However, it does make you happier and when he actually responds back, you\u2019re absolutely overjoyed. Eventually your Mom gets home and you and your Dad cease talking for the day, he does mention how you weren\u2019t as boring as he thought you\u2019d be and wouldn\u2019t mind spending more quality time with you in the future. You\u2019re very happy.\n\nTime passes and you talk with your Dad a lot more regularly. You still don\u2019t have any friends at school, but you don\u2019t care you got your Dad to talk to and confide in. He buys you anything you want and you spend a lot of time together talking about a wide variety of things. One day he even passes on going to one of the swinger parties and tells your Mom she can go by herself since he promised to help you with your homework.\n\nThen just as you are completing it he asks you a serious question.\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re always stuck in the books? Why don\u2019t you date?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026I dunno. The boys don\u2019t like me at school. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pretty enough to date anyway.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense. You\u2019re very pretty! Hell, you look like your mother when she was young and not a complete fucking whoring bitch.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I know so.\u201d He says stroking your hair and smiling.\n\u201cThanks Dad.\u201d\n\nYou then give him a big hug for his compliment. You hold each other tightly, and then you look into each other\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\n(Oh this is just SO fucking wrong)\n\nHe kisses you passionately on the lips, and you don\u2019t resist. You\u2019ve never felt this kind of closeness to anyone before so you embrace it, because it feels so right to you. He loves you in a way that nobody else ever could. Before you know it you\u2019re going down on him and looking up for his approval as you work the shaft and tasting the very dick that once took part in creating you.\n\nBut before he explodes you want to FEEL him inside you which he\u2019s eager to do. After all he likes giving you what you want. You feel that big cock inside your tight unspoiled pussy and the pain doesn\u2019t even bother you, you feel so safe right now and you\u2019ve never felt that before. You\u2019ve never felt needed and wanted like he needs and wants you right now.\n\n\u201cOh god, shit yeah, UGH! Just like your mother\u2026\u201d he moans as he releases his seed into you.\n\nYou and he then cuddle and fall asleep in each others arms.\n\n\nWow, you realize you just got deflowered by your Dad right? Let\u2019s see the exact repercussions of that shall we?\n\nYou and your Dad carry on this forbidden love affair for a few months until your Mom catches on. She might\u2019ve caught on a lot sooner had she not been drunk half the time. Still even she knew exactly what was going on the day she saw your Dad fucking you on all fours while he slapped your ass taking the catch phrase \u201cWho\u2019s yo\u2019 Daddy?\u201d to a whole new level.\n\nWell as fucked up as your Mom is, even she\u2019s not putting up with this twisted shit. In fact she sees you as a threat attempting to take her place as a younger version of herself (Which isn\u2019t completely inaccurate) she raises all holy hell and decides that this would be a \u201cforgivable\u201d excuse for getting divorced, not to mention having your Dad thrown in jail. You aren\u2019t allowed to see him at all, which fills you with sorrow. You\u2019ve been separated from your love.\n\nWhile all this turmoil is going on, you have to live with your Mom, who is a complete bitch to you when she\u2019s home at all and to make matters worse you\u2019re pregnant! You can\u2019t go to school at all now, the kids there all find out you were fucking your dad and pregnant with his child so you have to be home schooled, which basically means you\u2019re teaching yourself. Your Mom insists that you should get an abortion, but you refuse since this will now be the only link to the man you ever loved. You\u2019re going to raise and love this baby just like it will love you back. And you\u2019ll definitely be a better mother.\n\nEventually nine months pass and you\u2019re in the hospital giving birth. The pain is great, almost unbearable, but oddly short. The labor doesn\u2019t take that long, but its far from uneventful\u2026\n\n\u201cOh\u2026my god\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHoly ugly shit! I think I\u2019m gonna be sick!\u201d\n\u201cThe horror\u2026the horror\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?! What is it? What\u2019s wrong with my baby?!\u201d you scream.\n\u201cWell ARRGH! MY HAND!!\u201d\n\nThe doctor suddenly reels back from you and clutches his gloved hand, or more accurately half of it, as part of it has been bitten off. Blood is spurting everywhere as the other nurses and doctors rush to help him and that\u2019s when you finally see your off spring crawl from your womb and on to your chest\n\nIt\u2019s an abominable horror. It isn\u2019t thankful for its life. Quite the contrary, it hates life and in particular the one that brought it into this world. You scream out but before anyone can help you, the abomination crawls quickly towards your face and rips out your throat with its teeth. It then escapes into the hospital ventilation shaft and eventually into the sewers where it grows larger and still stalks them to this day.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nUh yeah, while a positive loving father figure should play a part in a young girl\u2019s life, it probably shouldn\u2019t be taken to that level. Remember, incest is everyone\u2019s problem when murderous mutant babies are born.\n\nTo sum up, never ever fuck your family members, unless you use protection. Then I guess its okay.\n\nErm, maybe not. Just stick to oral.\n\nAnd now you know!", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}
