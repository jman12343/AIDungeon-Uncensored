The only light other than the candle Mama clutches in her hand comes from the moon, whose once bright, white, inviting and warm light is now deep red, like it's been splattered with blood. You're curled up with your two sisters, Ivana and Lilia, with Mama sitting over you, her candle in one hand and a wooden crucifix in the other. Papa is nailing boards to keep the door shut, hastily trying to give you some extra protection.\n\n\nIt's the Night of the Blood Moon. You've never been through one, the last happening less than a year before your birth, but now, after another twelve years, it had arrived. Your eldest brother, Dornan, told stories about it, stories that chilled you to the bone, that kept you from sleep, that gave birth to the horrors of your nightmares. If even a fraction of what Dornan said is true, the screams should begin soon.\n\n\n\"Mama?\" Lilia asks.\n\n\n\"Hush, darling,\" Mama replies, as Papa finishes boarding up the door and grabs his shotgun from it's place on the wall. He takes his spot next to you, his gun pointed at the door, and you wait.\n\n\nThe screams start soon. Howls of pain and terror from other houses of the town. Ivana is old enough to know to stay quiet, but Lilia soon starts to cry. Mama desperately tries to hush her six year old daughter, but to no avail.\n\n\n\"Sssh! Sssh, darling! It's alright, you just must stay quiet!\" Papa says.\n\n\nSuddenly, a tall, dark shadow passes by the window. Papa immediately grabs his shotgun, frantically raising it to his shoulder. The shadow disappears, and Papa breaths a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\"Scared of something?\" a deep, guttural voice says from behind you.\n\n\nPapa turns, firing his shotgun as the monster speeds forward. It grabs Papa's throat with unnatural speed, smiling as it holds him in the air, strangling him.\n\n\nThe monster looks hideous. It's dreadfully pale, it's face twisted with hate, and looks to be hairless. It's eyes are completely black, like the endless darkness of its soul, and it's mouth is filled with mangled teeth with two large fangs, curved and bloodstained, with even more blood pouring down its face. The creature snarls, before smiling as it turns to look at you and your siblings. \n\n\n\"Ah... so young... so fresh...\" the vampire says, licking it's lipless mouth with a forked tongue. \"Peasant, your daughters are mine. Don't struggle.\"\n\n\nThe vampire tosses Papa to the ground, turning towards your siblings.\n\n\n\"No! No! You will not take my daughters!\" Father says, grabbing for his gun.\n\n\nThe monster strikes, smashing it's boot into Papa's head.\n\n\n\"How dare you?!\" the monster screams. \"I gave you your land, I gave you your house, I give you your life!\"\n\n\nThe monster begins walking toward Papa, who desperately crawls back to the wall.\n\n\n\"I keep the beasts away from the village! I let you roam the night all but one night every twelve years! I don't ask for your wife, to allow you to sire more. I don't ask for your son, to leave you a legacy. I only ask for your daughters! How dare you attempt to deny me that?\"\n\n\nAs the vampire walks towards Papa, his fangs bared, you see a chance to get Papa's shotgun. Still, you don't want to anger the vampire further.

He snarls, walking forward quickly. You reach for the gun again, but he steps on your hand as you yelp in pain.\n\n\n\"You dare shoot me? I have lived millennia, you think you'll be the one to end my life?\" the hunter snarls, before laughing, a horrible, terrifying noise. \"You have balls, little one.\"\n\n\nYou stare at the monster in front of you, trying to stare him, but you see nothing but hate and unquenching thirst behind his eyes.\n\n\n\"Yes... I see strength in you. Potential. I have an offer for you, as the newfound man of the house. Join me. Let me take you on as my... apprentice. As my servant. As my slave. As whatever I need you to be.

A single carriage lies there, with a hunch-backed man sitting there, wearing a low-down bowler hat, a balaclava and a large coat that cover his appearance.\n\n\n\"Haygarth! We're finished here. I've fed,\" the vampire growls.\n\n\nThe hunch-back nods eagerly, grabbing the reigns of the horses.\n\n\n\"Yes, sir, ready to go, sir!\" Haygarth says eagerly. \"And the boy?\"\n\n\n\"He is mine,\" the vampire says, as he steps into the carriage.\n\n\n\"Yes sir, yes sir! Up front, boy! Quickly!\" Haygarth says.\n\n\nYou quickly walk up to the carriage, climbing into the shotgun seat of the carriage. Haygarth seems badly deformed, clearly attempting to cover his appearance with his large coat, low hat and balaclava, but he still looks monstrous. Haygarth quickly stirs the horses into a trot, as you leave the town that's always been your home.\n\n\n\"You're to serve Count Grey?\" the hunchback asks.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" you say, barely coming to terms with the fact.\n\n\n\"Hmm... we'll see how long you last,\" Haygarth says. \"Yes, we'll see...\" ", "action_results": [{"action": "Three Years Later...", "result": "You sit on the ground, scrubbing the cold stone floor of the Grey Castle, named as much for its cold, lifeless demeanor as much as its owner. Haygarth stands over you, watching as he makes sure you do a proper job cleaning the blood stains that cover the ground, a remainder of the last girl foolish enough to be out at night. \n\n\nSo far, your job has been simple. You have little contact with Count Grey, as you work in the day and sleep at night, whilst he sleeps in the day, coming out at night to hunt, feed, plan and much more. Mostly, Haygarth forces you to work at any job he sees fit. He seems to think you're little different from a pack horse, working you as hard as them. If anything, he's feeding the pack horses better. You see your role in the castle as a servant on your more optimistic days, and as a slave on the worse ones.\n\n\n\"Good, good, put your back into it! Yes, that's it!\" Haygarth says, as he hurries around the room, collecting pieces of clothes left over from the poor girl being brutally murdered.\n\n\n\"Yes, Haygarth,\" you reply, putting your pressure on the brush as you splash some more water to get rid of a particularly disgusting stain of a mixture of blood and urine.\n\n\nHaygarth is a hard ruler, forcing you to work day and night. He's not sadistic or cruel, he just doesn't seem to understand that you're not an animal who needs a break. Hell, perhaps his only redeemable feature is the fact that he works himself even harder. As he rushes past, trying to do various chores, you can hear him angrily mutter to himself to go faster.\n\n\nYou finish off the stain, quickly crawling over to the next. You sigh as you realize just how much you need to clean. Your knees hurt from crawling around all day, your hands are covered in blisters, and you've done nothing but work all day. You had two ive minute breaks to cram food into your mouth, and one more to shit, and that was it.

He frowns, looking at the ground behind you, where ironically you've polished the stones enough for him to vaguely look at himself.\n\n\n\"You... you know, you sound just like my mother, or Count Grey. Mean. Cruel. Perhaps it's good you've found yourself serving a man such as the Count. He could be your soul mate, if he had a soul.\"\n\n\nHaygarth hobbles out of the room, leaving you alone. You continue keeping working, but fuck, the floor is pretty clean. You sit down, leaning against the wall as you sigh as your aching muscles get relief. You take a deep breath, as you watch the the sun fall in the distance. After about half an hour, the moon has finally appeared, and Haygarth appears.\n\n\n\"Come. We need to wake Count Grey,\" he says, not looking at you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow Haygarth", "result": "You follow Haygarth along the hallways with haste. You hurry down the stairs, quickly heading to the lowest floor, at the center of the castle, into a dark room, empty except for a single, candle-adored coffin leaning against the stone wall, and a large, black sword hanging above the coffin.\n\n\nThe coffin in intricate, a large, black wooden coffin with an intricate, thorny pattern, and a single silver, demonic face with a roaring mouth with a pair of fangs on the front.\n\n\nThe sword, on the other hand, is somehow even darker, its surface seeming to suck the very light from the room. Even staring at the thin edge makes you feel like you've been stabbed. You can practically taste the hatred and malice that emanates from it. \n\n\n\"Do you feel it?\" Haygarth says. \"That is the master of the home.\"\n\n\nYou feel the hairs stand up on your skin. The air tastes stale and rotten, and there's a general feeling of dread emanating from it. In a place like this, you feel even if you called on the good Lord to save you, he would be unable to find your soul in such an abyss of all warm or love, let alone rescue you from it.\n\n\n\"What now?\" you ask.\n\n\nHaygarth grabs your hand, pulling it forward until your hand touches the metal.\n\n\n\"It... stings,\" you say, as it feels like your hand is both being put against a hot stove and a freezing block of ice.\n\n\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Haygarth says, drawing an iron blade from his side. \n\n\nHaygarth presses the blade against your arm, smiling as he slices open your arm, a long, deep cut appearing with a stream of blood.\n\n\n\"Ah!\" you yelp as your arm is covered red. \"Stop!\"\n\n\n\"It's necessary,\" Haygarth replies. \"We need to draw blood.\"\n\n\n\"Did you need to cut so deep?\" you complain.\n\n\n\"I wanted to,\" Haygarth replies, shoving your arm in the silver mouth of the demon, cut first. Blood begins to pour down the creature's mouth, as the coffin's door clicks open. Haygarth grabs you by the collar, pulling you back. Count Grey steps forward. He looks the same as he has every night since the night he took you, except now his lips look parched and cracked, his eyes immediately darting down to your arm.\n\n\n\"Thirst,\" he moans, staring at your wound.\n\n\nHaygarth hits you in the back with a snarl.\n\n\n\"Come on, boy, feed your master!\"\n\n\nYou hold your arm forward, as Count Grey grabs it, his mouth darting down to your bleeding wound with an insane speed. You close your eyes and wait for the pain of his bite, but instead feel his cold lips on your wound, instantly beginning to suck the blood out of your arm. You take a deep breath as you go pale, Haygarth putting your arm around his shoulder to keep you from fainting. After about a minute, Count Grey stops, raising his head as he smiles.\n\n\n\"Good. I was thirsty. The bitch from the other night was dry, and half her blood ended up on the floors. Good thing I managed to stop myself from draining you completely,\" Count Grey says.\n\n\nHe looks up at the sword that hangs above the coffin, staring at it for a second. \n\n\n\"Do you see that sword? While I like to keep up to date with my weapon technology, such as with rifles. grenades and the new and innovative Maxim Gun, in cases of the super-natural, the old stuff is the best. I've had that sword since I was a child. Forged it myself under command of my master. So many ancient, arcane inscriptions, horrid rituals and infinitely worse had to be done to make it the thing it is today. It's name is the Psych\u00ed L\u00edptis. It is a killing machine.

You stop at one of the larger brick houses, with a fancy looking brass knocker. Count Grey briefly knocked on the wooden door, waiting. There was a loud noise inside, as the owner scrambled to get ready. The door opened on a chain, with an elderly bespectacled man peering out.\n\n\n\"May I... oh, my...\" the man said, stepping back. \n\n\nCount Grey grabbed him by the throat, tearing the door open as the chain snapped.

Haygarth has forbidden you from entering, which only mean that you had one less room to clean. Count Grey pulls a short, silver key from his pocket. He opens the door, revealing a massive storage room. The room is filled with cabinets and shelving units. They\u2019re all filled with crystal bottles, filled with a scarlet red ichor.\n\n\n\u201cThis castle was built to withstand a siege. It\u2019s storerooms could keep a force here going for years with wheat, potatoes, salted meats and more, as well as small gardens. Unfortunately, I require a more\u2026 delicate solution to avoid starving.\u201d\n\n\nYou look at the endless bottles of blood, wondering how many lives were given to fill them.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to successfully bottle blood. Let alone hard hard it is to get it from the victim without a needle and a few hours. You\u2019ll need to get quite good at that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou want me to kill people and bottle their blood?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cYes. Not just anyone. Virgins, particularly. Once they\u2019ve lost that, their blood\u2019s impure, and will spoil quickly enough outside the body. After that, you\u2019ll need to keep it around for a few days, make sure it doesn\u2019t spoil.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you said virgin blood doesn\u2019t spoil.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but in this day and age, it\u2019s so hard to tell. I always struggle to pick out my targets. I want them to be young enough to be a virgin, but still old enough to\u2026 well, perhaps from the morality my tribe taught me oh so many years ago, I don\u2019t want to kill babies, or children that young. I\u2019m perfectly willing to, mind you, but I don\u2019t find it necessary when there are so many other potential blood bags. Even then, you can never be sure. You always have some human filth so enamored with mortal concepts like sex that they end up defiling children. You\u2019d be surprised by how young I\u2019ve found my victims to be, yet still spoiled. Oh, they say power corrupts, but it just lets people be who they are naturally. Perhaps some day, we\u2019ll see who you are at heart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes\u2026 does it have to be children?\u201d you ask. \u201cWhat about someone like\u2026 the Catholic priests in the village?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa! I\u2019d be able to find more virgins among the girls at the whore house then at the church!\u201d Count Grey says, laughing. His laughter is\u2026 unnatrual. Even though you understand the context to the joke, you still somehow feel as if he\u2019s laughing maniacally since he\u2019s got you at his mercy, which you suppose he does.\n\n\nYou weakly smile, before the weight of the dead girl over your shoulders becomes too much and you lower her onto the cold stone floor, keeping the now red, sticky rag pressed against her wound.\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes. We\u2019re wasting time,\u201d he says.\n\n\nCount Grey grabs a crystal bottle, handing to you.\n\n\n\u201cMove the rag, and replace it with bottle. Fill it,\u201d he says.\n\n\nYou take the bottle and remove the rag, quickly pressing the bottle against the bleeding wound, as blood continues to flow into it. You take effort not to look at the girl\u2019s face, watching as the bottle is slowly filled.\n\n\n\"The heart is a tremendous organ, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Count Grey says, licking his lips. \u201cSo\u2026 fresh. So\u2026 delicious.\u201d\n\n\nThe vampire snarls, taking a deep breath. For a second, his face contorts into a combination of that of a starving man willing to break any moral code to feed his hunger, that of a hate-filled demon knowing nothing other than the negative emotions that plague the depths of man\u2019s soul, as well as that of a beast, knowing only hunger. You step back, almost knocking over a rack of bottles, before Count Grey pauses.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little one. It\u2019s just that staring at the blood makes me so, so thirsty. I\u2019d imagine you\u2019ll be able to fill up a lot more bottles than I, seeing as you won\u2019t be tempted to down the bottle you\u2019re filling at any given moment.\u201d\n\n\nCount Grey takes the bottle, pouring a small amount into an ornate wooden bowl, before capping the bottle with a crystal stopper.\n\n\n\u201cNo, we test. You get this little box,\u201d he said, grabbing an oak box from the cabinet, and opening it to reveal various things.\n\n\nCount Grey draws out a long tooth, seemingly from a vampire. It looks to be a curved, deadly sharp fang.\n\n\n\u201cThis belonged to Elise the Skin-Taker. You need to drop the fang in the bowl, and leave it there for three days. If the tooth is no different, put the tooth back in the box and put the bottle with the others. If the tooth has turned black, dump out the blood and wash out the bottle. Then, use a blade to scrape of the rotten outside, and put the rest, the tooth that's not rotten, back in the box. Be careful. A tooth can only last two or three of these, and I only have so many. Getting more takes another trip to the wilder regions and find a maddened, bestial vampire without reason or logic, a bandit who has found himself with the gifts of the blood moon or some aspiring Vampire who wishes to be a count.\"\n\n\nCount Grey puts the bottle on the stone table, next to the bowl.\n\n\n\"You've prepared your first bottle, little one. You'll prepare many more. You've proven yourself tonight. Now, your job changes. Follow me,\" he says.\n\n\nCount Grey walks along the hallways, stopping at a small, wooden door that again has remained locked during your stay here. He opens it with the same key, before handing it to you.\n\n\n\"Here. This is your new room,\" he says, opening the door.\n\n\nIn stark contrast with your last room, a simple tiny bed in a barren room, this one is surprisingly less furnished. A desk and chair stands there, a mirror, a wardrobe and a large bed. A gun rack sits by the single window, with two rifles and a shotgun in it.\n\n\n\"Thank you, thank you master!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Open the wardrobe,\" Count Grey commands.\n\n\nYou walk forward, opening the wardrobe. Inside is a pair of black leather boots, black trousers, a black shirt, a dark red leather long coat and belt and a dark red tri-corner hat.\n\n\n\"Put it on,\" Count Grey commands. \n\n\nYou quickly get undressed, as Count Grey stares, bored, at the wall. You get dressed into the outfit, turning to look back at your master.\n\n\n\"Yes... it fits well. Kneel, dog,\" the vampire says.\n\n\nYou drop to your knee, bowing your head low. You look up at Count Grey, who raises his arm to his mouth. He bites it, releasing a flow of blood that runs down his hands. He holds it out, staring at you expectantly.\n\n\n\"Drink,\" he commands.\n\n\nYou look at the burgundy liquid running down the vampire's arm, in stark contrast with the white, ghastly skin. You put your mouth to the wound, and begin to suck.\n\n\nThe liquid is like a poison. Your skin begins to tingle, as you feel drowsy. You try to pull your head away, but the vampire holds it in place.\n\n\n\"Drink!\" he commands aggressively.\n\n\nYou keep drinking the cold liquid down, as your stomach begins to churn. You feel like you're about to collapse into a coma, as the blood seems to drain your life source. Finally, Count Grey lets you pull your head back.\n\n\n\"Rise, ghoul,\" he commands.\n\n\nYou stand, trying not to puke. You look at Count Grey, who raises an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"Are you going to vomit, child?\" he asks.\n\n\nYou feel the puke rise up in your throat, but hold it down, shaking your head.\n\n\n\"Well done,\" he says. \"Now, you're a ghoul. No longer will you work like a slave with Haygarth. You will hunt for me when I am busy. You will scout and pick out potential prey. You will guard the castle.

You follow him, as does Lucas, walking alongside him as Dasha stirs with a groan, but doesn't break her slumber.\n\n\nYou walk into the keep, and quickly down to the dungeons. The large dungeon is covered with an earth floor, and four occupied cells. Four women, all of similar age and appearance to Dasha, all whose names you've forgotten, are there. Their mouths are gagged, though they scream desperately as they see you enter. Mikhail mutters a curse under his breath as he tries not to make eye contact with the women, but Lucas smiles and cheerfully waves at women.

You make yourself a sandwich from cold meat, nuts and dates, and quietly consume it, while watching as the world blackens. Just as you see the first red haze on the horizon of the rising blood moon, you quickly turn and head quickly down to the Count's chambers. You hurry down the stairs, quickly heading to the lowest floor, at the center of the castle. Mikhail is already waiting in the dark room, empty except for a single, candle-adored coffin leaning against the stone wall.\n\n\nThe coffin in intricate, a large, black wooden coffin with an intricate, thorny pattern, and a single silver, demonic face with a roaring mouth with a pair of fangs on the front. You can feel the dark feeling emanating from it. It makes you feel cold just looking at it, and you shudder at the thought of what lies inside. Nonetheless, it is your duty to awaken your master.\n\n\nLucas hurries into the room,, dropping his cigarette and crushing it under his heel. He looks at both of you.\n\n\n\"Oh good, we're all here.

You take in a deep breath as you feel the sharp pain. Blood pours down your arm, and your press the open cut into the roaring mouth of the silver ideal, smearing it with blood. You count to three, before leaning in.\n\n\n\"Glorious Master, the night has come and the world is yours,\" you whisper.\n\n\nYou step back as the coffin door is pushed open. Inside stands the Count. Dried blood cakes the corners of his mouth, as he lets out a growl, flashing his long, curved fangs, that look sharper than a needle. His black, soulless eyes peer into yours, as you take a deep breath. You outstretch your arm, and he walks forward, grabbing you by the wrist. He brings your arm to his mouth, and begins to suck. He sucks the blood that pumps from your cut as you wince, before releasing you. Mikhail hands you a roll of bandage, which you quickly begin wrapping them around your wound.

He stares out at the darkness, and the rising red moon.\n\n\n\"Good... good...\" he says. \"Prepare altar. The Viceroys will be here soon.\"\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, and quickly head down to the dungeons, followed by the others. The gagged woman are in the cells, curled up and terrified. Dasha is still unconscious, which gives you pause.\n\n\n\"The new girl, Dasha, look at her,\" you say.\n\n\n\"What of her?\" Lucas asks.\n\n\n\"She's still not awake. Maybe you used too much chloroform, Mikhail,\" you say.\n\n\n\"No, I used the normal amount.

Just unconscious. The idiot must've used too much chloroform. She's alive, she'll do, alright?\"\n\n\nMikhail shrugs, slinging the girl over his shoulder.

The girls are shackled, so they're incapable of struggling much, but any resistance leads quickly to a punch to the side of the head.\n\n\n\"Samuel, get the last two!\" Lucas shouts.\n\n\nYou grab the cell keys, walking over. One of the girl stares at you with rage, the other sits in the back corner in terror. You open the scared girl's cell first, grabbing her by her chain. You drag her out of the cell, before opening the second cell and grabbing the more resistant girl.\n\n\n\"Don't fight me on this.

In front of you in a large, open stone room. Groves cover the stone floor, making the shape of a large pentagram. Lucas' two prisoners are kneeling at two of the points of the pentagram chained to a loop in the stone to prevent them from moving, while Dasha lies at the third, her unconscious state meaning she doesn't need to be chained up. \n\n\n\"Come on,\" you say, raising your fist to threaten the second girl. You force her to kneel on the ground and chain her to the loop in the ground. You drag the first girl to the other, doing the same.\n\n\nMikhail and Lucas stand off to the side, watching them. Mikhail looks down, looking vaguely embarrassed at his part in this. Lucas, however, seems ecstatic. He walks forward, grinning as he draws his dagger.\n\n\n\"Oh boy, look at that!\" he says, dropping to his knees in front of a girl. \"Look at that. You see the pentagram? You see those deep, thick groves? I'm going to fill them with your blood. You like that? You ready?\"\n\n\nThe girl frantically begins to struggle, as Lucas smiles. Lucas slices the girl's throat open, as blood pours out, flooding into the grove and running along.

She tries to struggle, but you grab her by the hair, holding her vulnerable throat out and slicing it open with a long cut, before slowly lowering her head to above the grove. Lucas grabs the next girl by the hair, holding her forward and quickly slashing her throat as the blood pours out.

He has long, curly black hair, and instead of the black attire of the other three, he instead dons  steel plated armor which covers  him from the neck down.  A sword hangs by his side. From what you know, he's almost five hundred years old, once being and most likely still remaining a formidable warrior. He looks at you, his eyes narrowing as he stares at you. He lets out a low, guttural growling at the sight of you. Even after years of work around Count Grey, the man manages to make you feel like little more than a blood bag.\n\n\nThe second, Viceroy Mihrab, is even older, almost as old as Count Grey. His skin seems unusually tight,  a light brown in complex, his face sunken, his eyes lacking any emotion whatsoever. He wears dark attire, his eyes glancing in your direction away for a second, before peering away with disinterest. He doesn't appear to be armed, but with the long, sharp fingernails on his hand that at that length qualify as swords as well as long fangs, he doesn't need them.\n\n\nThe final Viceroy, Alexa, is the only woman of te group. She wears a black hooded cloak, her pale, scarred face underneath, with unnaturally long fangs even for one of her kind to halfway down towards her chin. She leans against the wall, looking at you without a single noise. She stares at you like a starved wolf. Something tells you that of all those present, she's the biggest threat. \n\n\n\"Yes, master?\" Mikhail says, standing up straight.\n\n\n\"Werewolves spotted on Hangman's Trail,\" he says. \"They're amassing. Perhaps for a strike.\"\n\n\nYou pause, and can hear the distant howls of what lies between monsters and men.\n\n\n\"We'll push them back, sir,\" Mikhail nods. \n\n\nMikhail turns away, and quickly begins heading to the armory. You follow, and you all quickly descend the stairs to the armory. You walk inside, grabbing a padded leather duster and slinging it over. You grab a rifle, as well as several magazines of silver bullets, popping them in a satchel that you put over your head. \n\n\nNow suitably armed, you grab a lantern, walking out towards the main hall. The Vampires have left, no doubt to partake in some drinks, discuss future plans, before beginning the ritual and, imbued with a power that grows as the blood moan rises, slaughtering dozens of helpless villagers.\n\n\nYou walk out the hall doors, pushing the door open and entering the dark night. You walk along the earth, passing the gate, which for some reason has been left open, one of the Viceroy's carriages sitting under the raised portcullis.\n\n\n\"Should we move it so we can drop the portcullis?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"And piss off Count Grey and whoever owns this carriage? No fucking chance,\" Lucas says.\n\n\nAs you leave and wander off into the trees. Soon, the only sound is the crunching of leaves under foot and your breathing.\n\n\n\"Control your breathing. Deep breaths. Watch your foot placement as well as the path in front of you. Avoid twigs and try leaves. We're trying to hunt, best be quiet about it,\" Lucas says. \"The man's most definitely untrustworthy and cruel, but he knows how to hunt.\n\n\nYou take his advise, holding the lantern out to illuminate the path ahead. You see a shape move to your right, and stop, immediately twisting to aim.\n\n\n\"Contract, left side!\" you whisper.\n\n\n\"Just a deer, stay focused!\" Lucas whispers. \"This is a fucking hunting trail, of course there's deer around!\"\n\n\nYou keep moving, you gun raised in your one hand, propped in the crook of your shoulder to allow you to aim. \n\n\nThe beam of your light comes across a deer lying on the ground. It's belly has been ripped to shreds, entrails covering the earth around it and soaking it with bodily fluids. It's head, connected to its body by a few strands of sinew and muscle, lies in the grass at the edge of the path, two lifeless eyes staring towards the stars. \n\n\n\"It's fresh, look out!\" Lucas growls, as you immediately turn. You see a form rush through the undergrowth, aiming at it, but it's gone before your finger can even tighten on the trigger. \n\n\nA growling comes from the trees to your left, and you swing your rifle over to aim at the beast. They're faster than usual. They're not supposed to be this fast. It must be that fucking moon!\n\n\nA howl comes from your right, and you drop your lantern to aim, catching a glance of blood-matted fur and a flash of white teeth. The beasts don't seem to bee going for the attack, rather endlessly circling, toying with you. None of you have even had the chance to fire a shot.\n\n\nSuddenly you see one of them, basked in the red glow of the moon, dead in the center of the path. This one stands directly there, hunched over and staring at you, clearly not scared in the slightest. It's abnormally large, not even wearing the tattered remains of clothes, covered in patches of fur. it's head is malformed, it's jaws filled with teeth that barely fit in its mouth, crushed into somewhat of a snout.

The gurgling lasts about a minute, which the vampires stay silent for. Finally, it stops.\n\n\n\"Goodbye, dear master,\" Mihrab says.\n\n\n\"Good. We're finished here.

She doesn't exactly step out of the shadows, instead the shadows manifest, forming into material as the vampire appears in front of you.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath, staring at her. She pushes the dagger against your neck, drawing blood that gently trickles down your neck. Her forked tongue darts forward and licks the blood as it runs down your neck, before she opens her mouth wide, her fangs pricking out. She gently scrapes her teeth along your neck, her breath as cold as a corpse, causing the hairs to stand on your neck.\n\n\n\"Look at you,\" she says in a half-purr, half-growl. \"You outsmarted the wolves, or maybe just got lucky.

I don't know how you didn't get noticed, let alone the girl.\"\n\n\nYour hand wraps around the gun, as you slowly raise it to point at the monster's head.\n\n\n\"Maybe Mihrab is too old, too proud, too over-confident to expect much from humans, not thinking to even check for you as you weren't a risk. Perhaps he needs to be taken off his so new throne. I'll admit, I like you. You have... balls. Listening in on three powerful vampires, pledging yourself to old Count Grey, even trying to grab your gun when my fangs are less than an inch away from your throat...\"\n\n\nYou grab your gun, raising it as your hand goes from the trigger. With the flat of her hand, Alexa slams it into your chest, knocking you against the wall as she grabs the gun from her hands.\n\n\n\"You're weak. Slow. Stupid. One of the qualms of being human, I suppose,\" Alexa says, examining your rifle. \"Uh, how I miss being able to eat some warm bread, drink myself stupid on cheap beer and feel the warmth of the sun on my face. Thankfully, I'm still able to enjoy some other... base pleasures. I'm so close to slicing your vein open and feasting on your delicious blood...\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you.

He has long, curly black hair, and instead of the black attire of the other three, wears steel plated armor covering him from the neck down, with a sword hanging by his side. From what you know, he's almost five hundred years, once being and most likely still remaining a formidable warrior. He looks at you, his eyes narrowing as he stares at you. He lets out a low, guttural growling at the sight of you, and even after years of work around Count Grey, the man manages to make you feel like little more than a blood bag.\n\n\nThe second, Viceroy Mihrab, is even older, almost as old as Count Grey. His skin seems unusually tight,  a light brown in complex, his face sunken, his eyes lacking any emotion whatsoever. He wears dark attire, his eyes glancing in your direction away for a second, before peering away with disinterest. He doesn't appear to be armed, but with the long, sharp fingernails on his hand that at that length qualify as swords as well as long fangs, he doesn't need them.\n\n\nThe final Viceroy, Alexa, is the only woman of the group. She wears a black hooded cloak, her pale, scarred face underneath, with unnaturally long fangs even for one of her kind to halfway down towards her chin. She leans against the wall, looking at you without a single noise. She stares at you like a starved wolf. Something tells you that of all those there, she's the biggest threat. \n\n\n\"Yes, master?\" Mikhail says, standing up straight.\n\n\n\"Werewolves spotted on Hangman's Trail,\" he says. \"They're amassing. Perhaps for a strike.\"\n\n\nYou pause, and can hear the distant howls of what lies between monsters and men.\n\n\n\"We'll push them back, sir,\" Mikhail nods. \n\n\nMikhail turns away, and quickly begins heading to the armory. You follow, and you all quickly descend the stairs to the armory. You walk inside, grabbing a padded leather duster and slinging it over. You grab a rifle, as well as several magazines of silver bullets, popping them in a satchel that you put over your head. \n\n\nNow suitably armed, you grab a lantern, walking out towards the main hall. The Vampires have left, no doubt to partake in some drinks, discuss future plans, before beginning the ritual and, imbued with a power that grows as the blood moan rises, slaughtering dozens of helpless villagers.\n\n\nYou walk out the hall doors, pushing the door open and entering the dark night. You walk along the earth, passing the gate, which for some reason has been left open, one of the Viceroy's carriages sitting under the raised portcullis.\n\n\n\"Should we move it so we can drop the portcullis?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"And piss off Count Grey and whoever owns this carriage? No fucking chance,\" Lucas says.\n\n\nAs you leave and wander off into the trees. Soon, the only sound is the crunching of leaves under foot and your breathing.\n\n\n\"Control your breathing. Deep breaths. Watch your foot placement as well as the path in front of you. Avoid twigs and try leaves. We're trying to hunt, best be quiet about it,\" Lucas says. \"The man's most definitely untrustworthy and cruel, but he knows how to hunt.\n\n\nYou take his advise, holding the lantern out to illuminate the path ahead. You see a shape move to your right, and stop, immediately twisting to aim.\n\n\n\"Contract, left side!\" you whisper.\n\n\n\"Just a deer, stay focused!\" Lucas whispers. \"This is a fucking hunting trail, of course there's deer around!\"\n\n\nYou keep moving, you gun raised in your one hand, propped in the crook of your shoulder to allow you to aim. \n\n\nThe beam of your light comes across a deer lying on the ground. It's belly has been ripped to shreds, entrails covering the earth around it and soaking it with bodily fluids. It's head, connected to its body by a few strands of sinew and muscle, lies in the grass at the edge of the path, two lifeless eyes staring towards the stars. \n\n\n\"It's fresh, look out!\" Lucas growls, as you immediately turn. You see a form rush through the undergrowth, aiming at it, but it's gone before your finger can even tighten on the trigger. \n\n\nA growling comes from the trees to your left, and you swing your rifle over to aim at the beast. They're faster than usual. They're not supposed to be this fast. It must be that fucking moon!\n\n\nA howl comes from your right, and you drop your lantern to aim, catching a glance of blood-matted fur and a flash of white teeth. The beasts don't seem to bee going for the attack, rather endlessly circling, toying with you. None of you have even had the chance to fire a shot.\n\n\nSuddenly you see one of them, basked in the red glow of the moon, dead in the center of the path. This one stands directly there, hunched over and staring at you, clearly not scared in the slightest. It's abnormally large, not even wearing the tattered remains of clothes, covered in patches of fur. it's head is malformed, it's jaws filled with teeth that barely fit in its mouth, crushed into somewhat of a snout.
