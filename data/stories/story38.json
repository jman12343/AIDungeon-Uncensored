We left underspace half an hour ago,\u201d Hinsman says from beside you. \u201cSmooth as butter. They have stabilizers set up here now, I didn\u2019t know that. This system\u2019s really had some work put into it since I was here last.\u201d\n\nIn his fifties but not yet looking his age, he\u2019s supposed to be dressed as an asteroid speculator out on holiday and is struggling in the narrow confines of his seat to tug his coat on. Hinsman\u2019s on the short side, and the garment is a couple of sizes too big. All around you others, tourists, businessmen, and families, are starting to collect their things as well.\n\n\u201cAnyway, just waiting on our transfer now.\u201d\n\nYou unsnap your safety belt. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHinsman\u2019s got the aisle seat, just one more factor in his unspoken role in keeping you from too much direct contact with the public. Fine by you. Your job has always been to protect these people, not make conversation. Gazing out the window, you have a good view of the green planet. Camarov IV. It\u2019s supposed to be beautiful, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re here to sightsee. This is just your fastest route back to work.\n\nThe Order cruiser you\u2019d been using got enough of a beating on your last mission it needed to be taken to a real shipyard for repairs, and meanwhile this transport was headed directly for Camarov and had two vacancies. There\u2019s another Order ship en route to here which you\u2019ll transfer to to be taken back to the Outer Rim. You\u2019ll never even set foot on this planet.\n\nThere is a gentle thud as the landing ship locks on and the crew starts shepherding passengers towards the exit. Hinsman combs his dark hair and tends to the mustache he\u2019s been cultivating. You just sit and wait.\n\nBoth of your wrist comms beep at the same time, and you see the Order ship has left underspace. There\u2019s a little flurry among the crew when it requests to lock on, but Hinsman flashes a badge and his signature smile and the two of you transfer over without incident.\n\nOnce aboard, the ship unlocks and moves to a safe distance for a jump. Then there\u2019s a delay as the pilot seems to have no intention of leaving until he downloads whatever media Camarov IV has to offer. Images of green hills and misty lakes and crystal spires and dancers on a stage and some sort of historical reimagining of Old Earth tumble across the viewscreen.\n\nThe pilot, Karoff, is middle aged, tall and with thinning blond hair just starting to shade to grey. His mustache however is much more impressive than Hinsman\u2019s. You\u2019ve worked with him before. You don't always get his sense of humor, but he's okay.\n\nThe next stop will be The Last Outpost for refueling, then you'll be taken along a scenic tour alternating between the most boring and dangerous parts of the Outer Rim as you go down the list fulfilling your various obligations there and being available to lend assistance in emergencies.\n\nYou lean against the wall and mentally check out until it\u2019s time to strap in for the jump to underspace. Hinsman was right, the in system stabilizers do improve the experience quite a bit.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe Last Outpost is dark when you approach.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Karoff mutters. The station floats in place like a fat black spider against the pale backdrop of the system\u2019s single barren planetoid. Karoff makes a few adjustments to make your approach less obvious and then starts running scans from a distance. It took you nearly a week to get out this far from Camarov and you\u2019re all aware that if there\u2019s trouble it\u2019ll be just as long before you can find any backup.\n\nThe Last Outpost was once a research hospital on the edge of protected space. Now it\u2019s a ways past the official line, although after the rollback it persisted as a stopover and fueling station for both the military and any junker the colony worlds could put together to evacuate in. Officially out of service and abandoned now as far as anyone outside the Order is supposed to know, it\u2019s still got enough automated defenses that any scavengers looking for scrap will be sent packing in a hurry. Or it used to, anyway. Hinsman is frowning over the console now too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cPirates?\u201d\n\nHinsman shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. The way some of the plating is buckled, this looks like a string of explosions from the inside. Mostly just in that one arm, but the defenses are offline and there\u2019s no more than basic life support anywhere on the station.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a soft beep as a scan is completed.\n\n\u201cOne life sign,\u201d Karoff grunts.\n\n\u201cEven if they pulled out everyone on mission, there should\u2019ve be at least three here for maintenance still.\u201d Hinsman joins you at the window as he finishes speaking and stares across the distance. \u201cBut...I\u2019ll hail them I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well. Doesn\u2019t look like they have much left to shoot at us anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope appearances aren\u2019t deceiving.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Inquiry", "result": "Karoff looks tense as Hinsman tries to contact the station. There\u2019s a long wait with no reply. He frowns and tries once again using Order passcodes.\n\nA green light blinks on, and then a moment later a haggard-looking blonde woman with high cheekbones and thin lips appears on the viewscreen with a crackling of static. \u201cSo someone finally did show up.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s voice is flat and blank. She\u2019s young and might have been pretty under other circumstances, but her eyes have dark rings under them, her face is sallow and her hair hasn\u2019t seen a brush in awhile. She dips a spoon in a tub of drippy, melting ice cream while staring at the screen indifferently.\n\nKaroff pulls up her ID while Hinsman coughs and clears his throat. \u201cAh...you\u2019re Matti Oswen, correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Agent Hinsman. We were just stopping over on our way into the Rim, but it looks like you\u2019ve had a bit of trouble here. Do you need assistance?\u201d He keeps his tone light and injects a note of friendly concern.\n\nShe blinks at him owlishly a moment, then sets the ice cream aside and scratches lightly at the side of her neck. \u201cI sent out a call, but the computer lost power and I\u2019m not sure it went through. That was...almost a week ago, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a maintenance worker, correct? What happened here, Matti? And where are the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cInea and Markov? Oh, they\u2019re dead.\u201d Her voice is still flat and strangely disinterested.\n\nKaroff dutifully pulls up their IDs as well. Their new status as deceased hasn\u2019t been updated in the Order database yet, anyhow, and as the three of you have heard nothing regarding the damage to the station or a rescue attempt you can only assume her distress signal never did make it out.\n\nOswen continues only after Hinsman prompts her again. \u201cInea had an accident while doing repairs and Markov killed himself and tried to take the rest of the station with him a couple of days later. I rerouted the power to redirect the blast just in time, but most of the generators still blew. I\u2019ve been sitting around in the dark and trying to eat everything in the freezers before it all spoils, and then figuring I\u2019d inject myself with something before the oxygen fails.\u201d\n\nHinsmans voice is soothing. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that Matti, but you\u2019ll be safe now. We\u2019re going to send out a request for help and then lock on to see what we can do about repairs in the meantime. We can route enough power over to make sure life support holds up, anyway.\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nOnce the call is cut, a distress signal is sent back to headquarters along with a short recorded message. The three of you briefly go over the situation.\n\nHinsman sums it all up. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a few days before anyone can arrive to help, and we can\u2019t leave until then. Even if no survivors were here, the station itself is vulnerable and hell, it\u2019s probably more necessary to the Order than any of us, if we\u2019re being honest. Although this Oswen woman...she might be in shock, or there might be something else going on there. Not sure we can trust her.\u201d\n\nKaroff spits out the end of his mustache. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get in there and find out the bitch slit their throats and made bikini tops out of their skin. Seen it happen before.\u201d\n\nYou look at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh, well not the skinning for bikinis part, but people get assigned to an out of the way place like this too long, they can just snap and start killing each other. Or there maybe was some kind of love triangle going on that turned nasty. And not the good kind of nasty,\u201d he adds, apparently feeling the need to clarify.\n\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re just going to have to risk our skins then,\u201d Hinsman says with a slight roll of his eyes. \u201cOr you and I anyway, Karoff. But Zee, you were always going to be working alone anyhow. You won\u2019t have us standing by in orbit if you go on by yourself, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from suiting up and taking a spare shuttle, if the job is urgent enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill may be awhile before we know exactly how bad the damage is to the Outpost,\u201d Karoff points out. \u201cShe could be needed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but...Zee, I guess this one is going to be your call. I don\u2019t have details on the mission you\u2019ve been requested for, so what\u2019s protocol here?\u201d\n\nThis would all be simpler if you could directly contact a commander, of course, but out here that\u2019s rarely possible and having to make decisions like this on the fly is part of the job.\n\nORDER when it started out stood for Outer Rim Defense, Evaluation and Research. The joke everyone likes to make is how when the Hunger virus appeared on the scene the E stood for Evacuation, and then finally Eradication.\n\nOf course that\u2019s the part you\u2019re all still working on. And it\u2019s not actually all that funny.\n\nThe Order is the peacekeeping force out past the edge of protected space, although not in any kind of official capacity anymore. A little over twenty years ago when the Hunger virus was at its peak and blazing from planet to planet, the border was rolled back and then rolled back again. Colonies and mining facilities, trading stations and outposts were cut off in the midst of the chaos and anyone who wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t evacuate was left to fend for themselves.\n\nSome of the Order agents were recalled back to New Terra, but for many more this was their home, this was just what they did. Momentum and habit went a long way and the organization already had enough ships, stations and equipment out here to continue operating much as they always had. If anything they were more effective now that the bureaucracy and red tape had been stripped away, although that sometimes birthed its own kind of controversy.\n\nIndependent, isolated colonies and small time miners and traders had no one to protect them from piracy, not to mention the trade consortiums that amounted to a more organized version of the same thing. They welcomed the Order\u2019s presence on one hand while resenting anything they perceived as meddling in their own affairs on another. In areas where the line between New Terra and frontier authorities blurred, certain parties also never failed to point out that the Order had no more jurisdiction than any other private organization; outside of the ancient one of might making right and the bit about possession and how it related to law, anyhow.\n\nAnd although on paper the organization kept to the same laws and standards they had from the beginning, they were just as on their own out here as anyone and had to see to their own people\u2019s interests and protection as well. New blood could be hard enough to find as it was without asking it to spill itself simply because it was the right thing to do. About the only thing anyone could agree on was that the Order were the only ones equipped to really do anything about the Hunger virus and so they should be left to it, no questions asked.\n\nSo thankfully, politics and the rest of that nonsense aren\u2019t anything you ever have to concern yourself with. All you do is your job, and all you worry about is doing it well. Right now that means making a judgment call on where you\u2019ll be the most effective. And right now, that does seem to be here. Nothing you were given indicated anyone was in direct danger, and the Last Outpost is as valuable to the Order as any of the other facilities you were asked to check on, and far more strategically important. The refueling station is what makes these little forays out in this area of Rim possible in the first place.", "action_results": [{"action": "Secure the station.", "result": "You indicate to the others that you\u2019ll stay for now and Karoff directs the ship on a route toward the station. It makes sense to at least do a cursory inspection of the damage and make sure that at least life support will hold up. And of course there\u2019s the other issue of the alleged sabotage and personnel having been lost under circumstances still waiting to be confirmed. Leaving just two operatives to handle it all isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nOf the station\u2019s eight arms, the docking bay is luckily on the side that\u2019s suffered the least damage. Karoff locks on without incident and the panels of the reinforced portal retract with a gentle whirring. Beyond, the station is dark and cold. You all file out and make your way out of the landing bay and down a hallway with the aid of flashlights. With what little power remains rerouted to life support, the portal to the central complex refuse to open. Attempts to contact Oswen on a short range channel fail, and so Hinsman finally gets the door moving with the aid of his gun; wiring the energy cell to the panel next to it, that is. At the jolt of power it snaps open with sudden speed, then begins to close again in slow motion and grinds to a halt about a third of the way. The three of you squeeze past and before long find yourselves in an open area, a kind of joint dining hall and exercise room with dead video screens lining the walls.\n\nThe kitchen area behind the dining hall is a disaster zone of empty plastic trays, overflowing trash bins and spoiled food. There\u2019s no sign of Matti although you do find her abandoned ice cream bucket. The three of you begin to search area by area. Although reluctant to split up, you do move a bit faster than the others and take to checking into rooms and around corners ahead of them.\n\nA pool of vivid crimson against the polished grey tile is your first confirmation that something has gone wrong. You race forward to Matti Oswen\u2019s crumpled form and check her pulse, clamping another hand down on the stub of her severed arm. Lifting the woman from the ground and calling out to the others, you splash your way through the blood, tracking it behind you while more soaks into your uniform.\n\nA medical station was one of the places the three of you had already searched, so you hasten to it and deposit her on a steel table, keeping your grip just above the wound while Hinsman activates the computer.\n\n\u201cThis nursing AI was obsolete fifteen years ago,\u201d he grumbles, taking a protective suit from a persistently dinging open door and yanking it on over his clothes.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit of overkill?\u201d Karoff asks, watching him.\n\nHinsman\u2019s response is muffled through the breathing filter. \u201cIt won\u2019t let me even proceed without it. This place was last used to quarantine evacuees exposed to Hunger, there\u2019s no such thing as overkill as far as the computer is concerned. Just be glad the whole station isn\u2019t set to self destruct the moment someone gets a paper cut.\u201d He pauses a moment to apply a tourniquet. \u201cNow...Zee, you step back, it hates you too.\u201d\n\nKaroff looks at you and snorts. \u201cI imagine so. You look like you just left the scene of an axe murder.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d already moved away at Hinsman\u2019s order, and now you ruefully wipe you face, hoping to achieve a clean spot. Karoff\u2019s ensuing guffaw informs you you probably just made the situation worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go clean up the mess in the hall...and myself,\u201d you say, turning to go.\n\n\u201cZee, wait, wait, Miss Oswen is going to need an arm transplant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nYou blink at Karoff. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\nThis just provokes more laughter.\n\nHinsman, who has been preoccupied with the soothing voice of the medical AI and the use of instruments taken out of little drawers that have been popping open in sequence, now shakes his head at the two of you as he changes to clean gloves. \u201cI\u2019m not that good a doctor, I\u2019m afraid. Zee, you go on.\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers at Karoff and in the other hand produces an oversized needle, like a magician\u2019s trick. \u201cBut I will need a blood donor, and guess who\u2019s compatible?\u201d\n\nAlready on your way out, you turn and get a glimpse of the pilot\u2019s grimace as the door slides shut between you.\n\n\n\nCleaning up is a tedious but straightforward affair. You scrub yourself down and change into a plain grey jumpsuit you find before returning to the scene of the accident and getting to work.", "action_results": [{"action": "Dispose of the severed arm", "result": "It seems Oswen had been trying to unjam a door that leads to one of the station\u2019s storage arms, in much the same way Hinsman had gotten you all into the central complex earlier. It was her misfortune that upon receiving a jolt from a maintenance tool the door had snapped shut, meaning it had been open to begin with.\n\nThere\u2019s enough juice left to get it back to where it was and you carefully retrieve the severed limb on the other side, slipping it into a biohazard bag. Taking a moment to confirm with Hinsman there\u2019s nothing he can do as far as reattaching it, you consider your options for disposal. An incinerator would the most straightforward, but those require an amount of energy that seems wasteful if not impossible to produce given the station\u2019s current reliance on emergency backup power for life support.\n\nYou remember then the walk in freezer in the kitchen behind the dining hall. At least that would keep it from rotting if it takes longer that expected to get the power on full. The room isn\u2019t able to maintain freezing temps anymore but it\u2019s still noticeably colder than the rest of the station, and the rest of the station is cold enough. Placing the bagged arm on a shelf, you halt a moment as your gaze fixes on the two bundled forms in the back. So you weren\u2019t the first one to have the idea to use the place as an impromptu morgue. These must be the bodies of the other two maintenance workers, Inea and Markov.", "action_results": [{"action": "Inspect the bodies", "result": "Opening the largest body bag first, you briefly examine Markov. Evidence of cuts, burns, and some bits of broken glass still embedded in the skin seem consistent with him having been in the vicinity of an explosion, although there were a lot of unanswered questions in Matti\u2019s brief explanation. Further details will have to wait till she\u2019s conscious again, you suppose.\n\nYou zip the bag back up and turn your attention to Inea. The dark haired woman\u2019s cause of death is immediately obvious, her skull on the left side having been caved in just above and behind the ear. \u2018An accident while doing repairs\u2019 was how Matti had described her death. While you can\u2019t yet find anything to contradict that, as you probe along the edges of the splintered bits of skull and cold globs of brain matter it seems to you it would\u2019ve taken an awful lot of force concentrated in that one spot all at once to do that kind of damage.\n\nThen again, Matti had nearly managed to kill herself as well. You wonder what sort of accident it was supposed to have been. It\u2019s almost incredible to you that three people so incompetent had been left in charge of such an important Outpost. It\u2019s true that space is a big place and Order agents and personnel are stretched thin, but in your experience it\u2019s rare for things to go this spectacularly wrong without someone being at fault.\n\nFinding nothing more of note, you close up that body bag too and then exit the freezer.

This would indicate The Last Outpost is...yup, it\u2019s damaged all right. And needs repairs. From people who are not us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo nothing immediate needs attending to? There\u2019s nothing wrong that would put you or Hinsman in danger if you waited here a few days?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, unsealing some of the station\u2019s arms would be pretty fatal. They took the brunt of Matti\u2019s hack rerouting job and a couple lost atmosphere. The old medical wing itself is in real bad shape obviously, that\u2019s where Markov set off the first explosion.

That means you can leave here and continue carrying out your orders just as soon as this mess with the dead workers is sorted out.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Hinsman is going to try waking Oswen up for a little while and then wanted us there afterwards to sort of put our heads together on how to handle all this,\u201d Karoff adds, nearly reading your mind.\n\nYou step toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, what\u2019s the rush?

They pause and look up at the soft whoosh of the door, but you take up position in an unobtrusive spot next to it and stay quiet till they resume the conversation. Oswen\u2019s words are hardly above a whisper. Her face is drawn and she\u2019s clearly in pain. Hinsman in his usual way is breezily taking her mind off things while leading her along to a series of key questions and not making it obvious that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201c...I don\u2019t know what happened to Inea exactly. She was just replacing some conduits in the old medical wing...standard stuff, it\u2019s got to be done every four years even in the areas no one uses anymore. Something fell and hit her on the head, he told me. But Markov was in shock, or something like it so he never really went into detail. He hardly left his room for two days, and after that he...\u201d she swallows hard and then continues at his gentle prompting. \u201cI mean, it never seemed that they were like, close close, but they\u2019d worked together a long time, and I can\u2019t think of any other reason he\u2019d do what he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas a report sent in about Inea\u2019s death?\u201d\n\nShe nods. \u201cWe sent one, yes. Markov filled in the details of course, since I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nHinsman looks at her intently a moment, then begins asking her some simple questions about their routines around the station, listening patiently to her answers before coming back around to Markov. \u201cSo when did you first realize what he was doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019d barely seen him in two days. That wasn\u2019t unusual even when there were three of us if we happened to be working on different areas of the station, but I was worried enough about how he was taking things I even went and knocked on his door once. He wouldn\u2019t answer. Although that day that...everything happened he turned the intercom on a couple of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell...nothing. I could hear him breathing and got the idea he was about to say something, but then it would cut out. I was definitely on edge by that time and not sleeping well, but I kept telling myself a team would be here soon, they\u2019d pick up Inea\u2019s body and station someone else here and surely they\u2019d notice what a wreck Mark was and do something to h-help.\u201d She has to stop a moment, and draws a shuddering breath.\n\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d\n\nI was taking a break in the main computer room...I\u2019d decided to sit in a VR film actually, to take my mind off things. Then all of a sudden a bunch of alerts started sounding.\u201d\n\nSomething crawls along your arm and you brush it away. An ant or something is your immediate assumption. A strong fragrance of freshly cut grass lingers in your nostrils.\n\n\u201cLook at the birds, Mommy!\u201d\n\n\u201cZani, get inside!\u201d\n\nWith the interference of the audio hallucinations you come back to yourself. An insect of any kind would be highly unlikely to have hitchhiked this far, and the scent of grass is not something you're certain you've even encountered enough to readily identify. Not to mention your sense of smell is rudimentary at best.\n\nOswen has been describing how she counteracted Markov's attempt to destroy the station. \u201cIt's almost funny, covering that exact scenario was one of the last things we did in training before they sent me out here. And it just hadn't really sunk in even then that he would really do something like that intentionally. But it worked just like they said it would.\u201d\n\nTouching your arm, you vividly remember the tickling, crawling sensation and look carefully at your clothes and the floor. There is no ant.\n\nYou shake your head to banish these distractions and refocus. You don\u2019t want to miss anything important.\n\n\u201cThere was a critical overload there in the medical arm where Mark had started the chain reaction, but I was able to redirect the worst of the rest into the arms next to it, so the blown generators were the only damage to the central complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when did you recover Markov's body?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell he wasn't dead yet, is the thing. The emergency shields were still holding in that section and the computer showed a life sign so I put on a breathing mask and went to try and drag him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was risky.\u201d\n\nShe gives another shaky laugh as she recalls the events. \u201cThe anti-grav was already down, and I had to cross this section where the wall and floor was just...gone, so I was terrified the shields would collapse and blow me right out into space. And then when I got to him he was covered in blood, almost unrecognizable. He was trying to unlock a cabinet but his hands were all torn up. There was broken glass and like, shrapnel, all in his skin. Some of it looked deep. And...the most difficult thing was he just wasn't himself.\u201d Her expression darkens. \u201cHe'd completely lost it, really. He screamed at me to get away and struggled and fought me. I ended up slashing open my arm on a big piece of bloody glass--\u201d\n\nShe falls silent a moment as her gaze drops to the bandaged stub. \u201cWell. I guess that doesn't matter now, huh?\u201d\n\nHinsman murmurs something sympathetic and she continues. \u201cAnd then he just straight up tried to kill me. Grabbed for my throat, and I kicked him and...I don't know exactly, we got separated and I was trying to orient myself because I was panicking and, you know, the gravity. And then he was just dead. I wasn't really thinking at that point, I hauled him back to the central complex, I was thinking something could be done, like the nursing AI would help or he could be put in cryo or something, you know, like in the VRs...but then of course once we reached Central the gravity kicked back in and I couldn't move him anymore, plus I was bleeding all over everything. I made sure nothing else was going to explode and then went to treat my arm, and brought a platform to lift him later. I moved Inea's body then too...to, to the dining hall freezer.\u201d She sounds momentarily embarrassed and lowers her voice for that, as if she thinks the New Terra health department might overhear and swoop in and shut the place down. \u201cSince the power was out completely in that section and we still had it on low in parts of Central.\u201d\n\nMatti stops herself and winces. \u201cI mean...not we. It was just me at that point. The most useless person around so of course I survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou handled all of that as well as anyone could have and I think better than most,\u201d Hinsman reassures her. \u201cThe rescue attempt is probably more than I would've tried, and you had no way of realizing then how far gone he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just can't figure it out, why he would...\u201d Matti trails off and shifts on the bed, closing her eyes and wincing. \u201cI'm just so tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet some rest. You've been a great help and I think you've explained most of what I could think to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you sealing off the door to the storage wing?\u201d This time the question comes from you. Hinsman gives you an irritated look at the interruption. Perhaps your tone was too blunt for his liking, but it really is something that had seemed odd to when you were cleaning up.\n\n\u201cOh. Well I knew all of you would be boarding soon, so I thought I should try to pull myself together and...you know, do my job for once. The power would be easier to get back on in the central complex if all the arms could be sealed off, and the storage wing door was jammed open.\u201d\n\nYou nod but say nothing.\n\nMatti rests her head weakly against the pillows. \u201cI should've just stayed there with my ice cream. I could really go for some now anyway, damn...\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll heat up some dinner for you soon, from our ship,\u201d Hinsman promises. \u201cI don't know about ice cream, we don't travel quite that luxurious, but we may have something that can pass as dessert around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she gives him a wan smile and leans her head back against her pillow, her blonde hair spread out on the pillow to frame her strained face like a halo.\n\n\u201cZee, let's go outside. I've been needing to talk to you and Karoff...where is he, anyway?\u201d\n\nYou'd already turned to exit with Hinsman stepping out into the hall behind you when you both spot the pilot coming down the hall.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Hinsman says.\n\n\u201cI know I am.\u201d Karoff replies with a wink. \u201cBut did I miss anything important?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Inference", "result": "\u201cMiss Oswen gave me enough details on the cause of the damage to start writing a report, at least, but some things still don\u2019t sit right with me.

But unfortunately Oswen had very little contact with him following Inea\u2019s death. And we don\u2019t even really know what happened to Inea herself other than Zee\u2019s examination indicating blunt force trauma to the head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, about that.\u201d Karoff fishes something out of his pocket and taps a button. \u201cRelevant?\u201d\n\nA 3D image of an energy canister is projected into the air in front of you all. You recognize the type; the larger energy cells can be volatile, so the canisters are made with half an inch of steel and an interior enamel coating for protection. This one is about the size of a fire extinguisher, which is typical.\n\nWhat\u2019s not typical about this one however is the is the dried blood and long strands of dark hair caught up on the outside of the sealing mechanism.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell did you find that?\u201d Hinsman wants to know.\n\n\u201cIn the storage arm where Miss Oswen lost hers. There are a lot of spent canisters piled up in there, and I was looking for more power cables just now and stumbled across this one.\u201d\n\nHinsman\u2019s brow is deeply furrowed as he studies the projection. \u201cThat is just suspicious as hell. Has anyone had a look at the body yet?\u201d\n\nYou and Karoff both shake your heads, and as Matti had just mentioned where they were stored, the three of you make your way to the dining hall.\n\nThe two bodies are on gurneys, zipped up in body bags in the back of the freezer. You open the bag holding the smaller form, ignoring Karoff\u2019s inquiries as to whether letting restaurant kitchens rent freezer space to morgues could be a viable alternate source of income.\n\nUpon examination the dark haired woman\u2019s cause of death is immediately obvious, her skull on the left side having been caved in just above and behind the ear.\n\n\u201cNot a glancing blow, either. There\u2019s no way that happens from a spent fuel canister falling on someone\u2019s head. Not even a full one.\u201d\n\nAfter a long moment he sighs and steps back. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s go over what facts we have. About a week ago, Inea Banca was doing routine maintenance in the medical wing and had her skull caved in with an energy canister. Markov Karst then goes into seclusion for two days, at the end of which he goes to the medical wing and attempts to cause a power overload that will destroy the station; a major act of treason against the Order that will render a number of Outer Rim colony worlds and ships unable to receive emergency aid and also kill the young woman who remains here. A bit dramatic even for a suicide attempt, but I suppose not outside the realm of possibility. When it fails he become violent when Oswen attempts a rescue and dies moments after. Miss Oswen sends out a distress call that doesn\u2019t seem to have gone through due to the failing power and waits here alone until we happen by. Does that all sound about right?\u201d\n\nYou mull that over while he and Karoff discuss the details a bit longer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more investigating we can do,\u201d Hinsman is saying. \u201cThe medical arm, for instance. That\u2019s where everything happened.\u201d\n\nKaroff shakes his head. \u201cAtmosphere and shielding has failed and there are holes blown straight through the plating. It\u2019d be too much a risk just to satisfy our curiosity, even for Zee.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair. It doesn\u2019t feel right to just sit around and wait on another team, though. We need to get together as much info as possible. It might be useful to read over the personnel reports again, and...oh! There\u2019s the report they sent in on Inea\u2019s death.\u201d Hinsman glances over at you. \u201cAnd what about you, Zee? Let\u2019s see that sharp analytical brain in action.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brain\u2019s not any sharper than yours I\u2019m afraid. And too bad, some kind of AI to analyze things might be more what you need right now.\u201d But you\u2019ve been following a particular train of thought, and at his prompting you decide to give it voice. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t fill out a death report on Inea Banca. I don\u2019t know why Oswen claimed that. Banca was still listed as alive in their database when Karoff pulled up her file, right before we boarded.

Markov did try to blow up the station.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have any proof of that? Or of anything Oswen has claimed?\u201d You wait. When neither is able to give a satisfactory answer, you continue. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility we have to consider, at least. All we really know is that Banca and Carst are dead and that someone damaged the station in a way that made most of the evidence inaccessible. And that Oswen tried to seal off the entire the entire wing containing the murder weapon right after we arrived.\u201d\n\nA couple of times while you were speaking Hinsman looked ready to interrupt, and now he cuts in as you pause, raking his fingers through his dark hair. \u201cZee, you can't seriously...urgh, I guess you're always serious. But Matti isn't a killer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you be sure of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause dammit. I can tell when people are lying. Matti's not like that.\u201d\n\nThe force of his protest surprises you. \u201cCan people tell when you lie to them?\u201d\n\nThat at least gets a short laugh. \u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I've had a couple more decades practice don't forget. You can trust me on this one though, Zee. That little girl's not some cold blooded killer.\u201d\n\nYou frown. \u201cI'm not denying you're better at reading people than I am. But at least one murder occurred and serious damage was done to a vital Order refueling station. You know I'm not saying anything anyone at HQ won't bring up. We need to look at real evidence, and for now all we have is one person's word for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're not qualified for this legal crap,\u201d Karoff complains.\n\n\u201cIt's the Outer Rim, buddy, we make our own law,\u201d Hinsman replies. \u201cHell, nobody should've ever gone out this far at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell now you just sound like a dirty anti-frontierist. But my point is that according to their files, Inea and Matti are both from Camerov IV. Pop them both in cryo and aim them at the planet. They can sort out the murder and if Matti turns out to have done any of the damage to the station she'll be right there and handy to retrieve.\u201d\n\nHinsman laughs at that. \u201cYou make it sound like we're such good friends with the Camerovs. They'd just love us dumping her off and then swooping in to grab her again I bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well I've got a dozen fusion torpedoes that say they won't complain too hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, I'm definitely not getting a bonus this year if I let you start a war. Anyway, everything else aside, Matti's lost a ton of blood and is pretty weak still.

You've been slowly losing your mind lately anyway, what's one bad theory?\n\n\u201cWell...we can check for the report,\u201d Karoff offers. \u201cThe one on Banca. Maybe it wasn't ever finalized and sent but we'll see if we can verify at least that much of her story.

You shuffle around behind him to get a look too.\n\n\u201cThat's the same encryption the messages on Markov's computer used,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cRight. Because it would appear that someone...can't imagine who...installed a little something to communicate with a probe somewhere. The probe in turn has been intercepting any outgoing messages, as of at least one day before Banca's murder. They\u2019re getting a little fancier with their methods but cutting communication before an attack is the classic technique.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we have pirates coming this way? Well damn.

The probe has been intercepting all outgoing signals. There won\u2019t be any help arriving for Miss Oswen or for the station or ourselves, because no one knows we need it.

And so much for your theory on Matti, Zee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny theories on what the package is?\u201d you ask after a moment\u2019s silence.\n\n\u201cCarst is from Galton Station, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Karoff asks. \u201cI think I saw it in his file. I\u2019ve been there once or twice, and don\u2019t ask for what. But they all but advertise they\u2019re a black market.\u201d\n\nHinsman nods, looking grim. \u201cMost likely blueprints for illegal weapons tech, or an ethics-stripped AI. Something small Carst could easily smuggle back over here the last time he was on leave. And something valuable and risky enough he\u2019d kill anybody who got in his way.\u201d\n\nKaroff taps around on the screen some more. \u201cToo bad he didn\u2019t survive,\u201d he finally says with a sigh. \u201cBecause I\u2019d sure like to kill him myself right now. Scans found the probe by the way. Way out there on the edge of the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really? That\u2019s something at least. Although it\u2019ll take time to get to and disable, and I\u2019m not sure we can spare that right now. We need to start thinking of how to defend ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sooner we get a distress call out the sooner we can put an end to all this,\u201d Karoff says. \u201cWe\u2019re nothing but a target right now, with the defenses down and if there\u2019s enough of them they can wear us down eventually without much risk to themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan the defenses be repaired?\u201d\n\nKaroff winces. \u201cI was afraid you were gonna ask that. And technically yes, but it\u2019s a big job. The turrets are in every arm of the station and we\u2019ll need to get power to all of them, which means cutting back here in the central area.\u201d\n\nThey both sink into a grim silence for a bit, before Hinsman finally looks over. \u201cAll right Zee, I guess you get the tiebreaker.

The possibility of attack is an ever evolving situation with the threat level varying from not worth mentioning to all of you dead and the station destroyed.

It\u2019s about the only one here that hasn\u2019t had its conduits fried, and you remove a connector you\u2019ll need. That and the EPN loaded with an energy canister you have strapped to your back should be all you need to power the turrets. After checking in on your wrist comm you start to make your way on down to the hall.\n\nYou carry a cable as well, meant to be attached to your suit. If you were following safety recommendations, one of the two clips along the length should always be anchored to something. You\u2019re not entirely sure you need it however.

Every so often there\u2019s a crackle from your headset as someone checks on you, but the dark halls are otherwise eerily silent. Doors line the walls on either side of you, firmly shutting away their secrets. One door is hanging open and askew on cracked hinges, and you see the long room beyond it is filled with rusting rows of bolted down bedframes. An infirmary at some time in the past, now with the back wall now ripped open to expose them to space. You can see the pale face of the barren rock the station orbits through the gap.\n\nYou drift down an elevator shaft and after a measured distance begin cutting your way out with a laser torch. Gripping the handrail behind you, you kick the slab of metal free. It tumbles forward, and forward, and out into space. Where you expected to find more hallway, you\u2019re now looking at a mostly missing wall, the blown out section large enough to pilot a shuttle through. You\u2019ve drifted out a short ways, watching the metal slab diminishing in the distance, still moving from the momentum of your kick.\n\nIt\u2019s then that you glance down and realize there\u2019s nothing beneath your feet but the void of space and the twinkling of stars. Most of the floor in this section has also been blown away. You pedal your legs in a panic and shoot upwards a short distance until you\u2019re suddenly snapped back. Grabbing at a projecting metal ledge, you steady yourself, realizing that if you hadn\u2019t clipped the tether to the elevator\u2019s handrail out of habit you might be in trouble right now.\n\nBelow, you can just see the edges of other rooms on other floors parallel to this one; the section beneath you has been ripped out clear through to the bottom of the station.

As you sail across the gap, you stare downward into infinity. You feel like you\u2019re flying. You feel like...a bird...\n\nGreen grass. The smell of it.\n\nA long blade of green grass, striped by the horizontal bars of sunlight and shadow cast by its fellows. An ant crawls up the blade, in and out of the stripes. Another ant tickles your arm.\n\nNew shadows race across the sun.

The force hurls you hard against the ground. The grass is gone, the earth is a scorched and blackened wound. You and the earth are the same now. Where is Nyla? The pain is incredible. Blackness. You--\n\n--you stare down into the blackness. You hit the wall on the other side hard but somehow instinctively grabbed the metal bar next to the airlock. The metal will surely bend, if you squeeze it any harder. Your eyes sting. Your chest aches like its simultaneously been hollowed out and is just about to burst. Physically you\u2019re fine. But from your memory--and you know now for certain that it was a memory--you know now that this is what it feels like to want to cry.\n\nNo tears stain your cheeks, of course.

Are you saying that\u2019s all invented?\u201d You\u2019re still angry. Not just at the questions the memories made you ask, but at the entire situation and what you know it will eventually lead to.

Whatever they\u2019d been expecting, anyone approaching will know the station has people inside ready to defend it now, and that you\u2019d been expecting them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hailing us,\u201d Karoff says.\n\n\u201cOh good, let me talk to them. Maybe they\u2019re going to surrender.\u201d\n\nKaroff smirks at the comment and patches the call through to the viewscreen. An older man with steel-grey hair and a scarred face looks down at Hinsman and says in a gravelly voice. \u201cI see you have a ship locked into the bay. Whoever you are, I suggest you use it. We won\u2019t stop you from leaving peacefully, but we\u2019re taking this station and anyone who tries to stop us will most certainly be killed.\u201d\n\nHinsman looks unimpressed. \u201cOn the contrary, I think it\u2019s you folks who\u2019d better turn around and leave. The Last Outpost is an Order station vital to maintaining peace in the Outer Rim, and if you fire upon it it\u2019s an act of war. We will hunt you down.

I tried to make this easy, but I\u2019ve never been afraid of a little work to get what I want, and I\u2019m going to enjoy killing you even more now.\u201d\n\nThe transmission cuts off and the first barrage of missiles collides with the central complex, shaking the whole station.\n\nYou steady yourself against the doorframe. \u201cThey know this area is shielded. I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t go for the turrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink those were just showoff shots to let us know they mean business,\u201d Karoff tells you. \u201cLook, they\u2019re deploying into new positions now.

I don\u2019t object at all to them wasting missiles,\u201d Hinsman says with a shrug. \u201cThey\u2019ll run out soon and then have to get within range of the turrets to use their lasers.\u201d\n\nKaroff has been tapping feverishly at a console, and suddenly interrupts. \u201cAnd there go a few of my own. Two can play the torpedo game.\u201d\n\nCrowding around the screen, you watch as the missiles spin through the formation the ships had been gathering up into. There are a couple of glancing hits that take one ship out of commission and force others to veer this way and that. Two more are hit but their shields hold. Shields are almost always going to be weaker on a ship than on a station, but you suspect they\u2019d all been angling themselves to protect the weaker ships in the center while they made their first sweep at the turrets.\n\nThe missiles that are evaded by the pirates were lined up so that they exploded against the shields of the larger carrier ship waiting behind them. Again, no significant damage done, but the big ship does start moving to get more distance from you, meaning it won\u2019t be so readily available to provide backup to the pirates.\n\nYou take a moment to send a torpedo tearing through the disabled ship, then frown at the screen. \u201cHere they come again.\u201d\n\nThe seven remaining ships come in at an angle, then just out of range of what would be a practical distance to take a shot at them they split into two groups, circling the station from opposite sides. The ships launch a series of missiles at the turrets as they swoop by, and while the lasers are able to take most of them out before impact, one does slip through and blow a gun into pieces spinning off into space.\n\nThe three of you exchange grim looks. You know that with every gun that goes down they\u2019ll have a growing safe area to maneuver in.\n\nA moment later the ships begin another sweep. They concentrate their fire at the arms surrounding the one with the turret they cleared. Karoff takes another one out with a well timed missile that hits at the moment they drop their own, but two more turrets are taken out regardless. As you watch, a smaller ship moves in, aiming for the now unprotected arm housing the medical wing. It takes you a moment, but you come to a sudden realization. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to board it!\u201d you say, remembering the massive gap open to space there.\n\n\u201cWe can stop them, surely?\u201d Hinsman asks.\n\nKaroff shakes his head. \u201cAt that angle, can\u2019t really...wait! My ship! I\u2019ve got a dozen torpedoes loaded still.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou transfered so much of the power over, though. It won\u2019t even have shielding. Let\u2019s stay on the station and just take up positions near the entrance to that section, pick them off when they come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know how many they have, and we don\u2019t have anything more powerful than a laser rifle. I really don\u2019t like leaving the rest of the ships free to do whatever while we\u2019re over there either.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re all running out of time fast.

Then when you\u2019re lined up with the damaged section, you drop down just a short ways and rotate to get a clear view straight across to wear the smaller ship is hovering within the massive hole gouged from the medical wing.\n\nTheir back hatch is open, and someone in a bulky suit is in the process of exiting. Caught with their shields down? Your timing couldn\u2019t be better. With a press of a button you send a fusion torpedo smashing into the exposed ship. The explosion rips right through it, and you wince a bit as it also engulfs the less damaged section of the medical wing beyond, reducing that entire tip of the arm into half-melted wreckage.\n\nBut, well, it was pretty messed up already. Maybe no one would notice.\n\n\u201cHey, great plan Zee, let\u2019s just take out an arm for every ship.

No sense in lingering out here without shields. Bad things can happen--just ask the other ship.\n\nRejoining the others, you see that indeed, the pirate ships are locking back into the carrier.\n\n\u201cCould be a trick,\u201d you point out.\n\nThe carrier slips into underspace a few moments later however, and after a short wait it becomes clear they\u2019d have had to emerge by now if they were trying any funny business with blinking around inside the system.\n\nHinsman slaps you on the back. \u201cWell that was a damn good shot, Zee.

The lights in the command center dim briefly as outside the station the massive shield generators hum to life. The turrets ready themselves and immediately begin spitting fire.
