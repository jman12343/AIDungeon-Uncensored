Most are born insane, it's said, but out of every ten, there is a good three that have no symptoms of brain defunctions. Of course, only an estimated three hundred are recorded to date.\n\nOf this small group through billions of the Earth's people, they are gifted with unusual abilities. Normally, telepathic abilities and telekenesis -- even more than those as well. They are normally instantly noticed at birth because they are born feeble; and the Umbilical cord detaches around five hours before birth. We speculate that that is because the brains oxygen lowers, except the part of the brain that can perform the Zempaph abilities that then 'vacuum' stronger brain cells - the many accelerated during the fetus phase - and use it to boost its power in the last moments.\n\nMost births have proven fine to the mother - no miscarriages or mothers dying have yet to be seen. Now, the whole Zempaph debate (on whether to take more special... 'precautions'...) is in 1983, when one in certain, a young boy, had murdered his fellow classmates in Gates Elementary School. It spawned the Zempaph Hazard and Confinement Law, which would immediately put any one of the specimen into special classes to undergo brain alterations. In this way, they would not be as unstable, and the chance of murder is cut in half. When they brake laws, they are confined to special rooms.\n\nSome people thought it wrong, but it had more support than protest.\n\nThe next incident... one of the most horrific incidents ever recorded in human history... would be The Devil's Act. In this, one Zempaph in specific had went on a rampage and destroyed cities near Canada... Chicago being a major one. Thousands or thousands had died from one: Julian Moore. He was around twenty-seven when the whole thing occured in 1989, using a manipulation of fire to destroy everything in sight. We still don't know if he is a 'Fire Manipulator' or a 'Fire Starter'. Fire Manipulators can bend an already lit fire, while a Starter can make it from components in the air.   \n\nMoore was taken down by the local police, but he was never found nor known to be dead. In fact, we think he is very well alive, surfing the State of the Union. We don't know if he's still dangerous, or if the insanity that drove him is gone.\n\n--Doctor Elaine J.
