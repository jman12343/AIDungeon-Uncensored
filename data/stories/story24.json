You were sharper than most of your classmates, and thus began to find the lectures boring, often huddling alone in your study with an ancient tome borrowed from the library with the librarian's grudging permission, learning on your own faster than your teachers could hope to achieve.\n\nFinally, the master magicians admitted defeat. They no longer could teach you anything, and thus it came as a relief to them, that you were chosen, with two other magicians, to fortify the guard of an Alzuran emissary on the dangerous, bandit-infested road to Khofte, a coastal city in the far south.\n\nThe council of magicians apparently thought that a bit of adventure would help to dull your restlessness and sharpen your practical skills.\n\n\nTo begin with, you must choose to specialize in one of the five elements: Fire, Air, Water, Ice and Earth.\nYou may still manipulate the other four, but you can only hope to access the powerful effects with the element of your specialization.\nFurthermore, specializing in one element also slightly affects your character. Ice elementalists are known for the cool and logical mind, while Earth magicians tend to be protective of their charges.\n\nChoose your Specialization.", "action_results": [{"action": "I choose to specialize in Fire, the element of Passion, Heat and Destruction.", "result": "You quickly, and with passion, learned everything you can from your chosen element, regarding little else.\n\nYou especially have disregarded the lessons of Water and of Ice, having nothing but contempt for those who have to think through every situation when, obviously, there is need for speed.\n\nYou possess a greater physical prowess than most of your classmates, and since your inborn arrogance left your without many friends but quite some enemies, you had to use your quickness and strength to avoid being the target of constant ridicule - noone dared to ridicule you after a while.\nInstead, you became something of a loner. You simply know you are a better magician than the others, and you are willing to prove it.\n\nThe specialization of Fire enables you to aquire a deadly arsenal of combat spells, far superior to that of other magicians. You are also able to command the element of elements, the Flames themselves, to do your bidding. Also, you are somewhat resistant to their heat.\n\n\nMake a note somewhere that you have specialized in Fire.", "action_results": [{"action": "I am ready to begin my journey!", "result": "It is early summer in the world of Thyr, and the smell of spring has not yet left the air.\n\nThe emmissary's trek consists of two coaches, one for the magicians, of which there are two more on board, and one for the emissary and his bodyguard himself. Furthermore, there are two dozens warriors on horse accompanying the trek, some of which are scouting ahead.\n\nIt has been two days since you left the Academy of Alzur, and by now you have left the city's military influence, as can be witnessed by the steady growing worse of the road.\n\nYou know close to nothing about Fahan Brownhand's - the emissary of Alzur - orders, or about the man himself, save that he is known to be a devious mind and a quick judge of character, abilities well received within a politician.\n\nAlso you know that your trek is carrying valuable gifts in jewels and gold for Khalar, the citystate you are destined to reach within the week.\n\nYour two magician-companions are no strangers to you. Opposite of you is sitting J'Arel Whitefang, a young man emitting an aura of arrogance that is barely to bear in the confines of the coach. He is, as you know, a capable Fire elementalist.\n\nCurrently on top of the coach, unable to bear the presence of J'Arel any longer, is Lucius Tarchild, an Air mage of some renown.

Likely some bandits roam the Woods, and that's the reason why lone travellers sometimes are never seen again.\"\n\nHe grins, and forms a magical gesture with his left palm, upon which a blueish flame appears there, a ball of pure energy powerful enough to burn through a tree when hurled with enough force.\n\n\"However, we are no lone travellers\", he adds, his malicious grin broadening. Then, he claps his hands together, and the flame vanishes.\n\n\"I doubt that some ragged band of bandits is going to choose us as our target anyway,\" he says, sounding disappointed. \"Those soldiers look like excellent fighters, and I am certain the bandits will see this as well.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue...", "result": "Suddenly, the coach shudders to a halt.

Not suffocated yet, I hope\", Lucius grins. J'Arel only snorts with disdain, throwing you a meaningful look as if the journey would have been quite pleasant without your companionship inside the coach.\n\nBefore you can think of how to answer that challenge, Lucius continues as if not noticing the tension between the two of you: \"Looks like we got ourselves some trouble coming. The captain of the scouts just raced his horse nearly to death coming here, then barely pauses to take a breath before arguing with old Farhan. Seems like they want us to make camp here, instead of driving on, but Farhan doesn't sound too happy about that.\"\n\nLucius gives the countryside an appraising glance.\n\n\"Can't say I blame them. It's a good position here, with the hills in front and the plains at the back. At least if anyone's sneaking up on us, they're doing so from only one direction.\"\n\nJ'Arel interrupts: \"Phah, let them come, so we can finally have some use. I don't see why...\"\n\nLucius holds up a hand to silence J'Arel, cocking his head to one side and closing his eyes, as if listening intently.\n\nAs you strain to hear anything untowards yourself, you notice it... the silence is unnatural. Where the journey was accompanied by the rustling of leaves and grass, the chirping and buzzing of insects and the caws of birds, there is now silence... even the horses of the guards seem to hold their breath.\n\nThen suddenly the first volley of arrows hit the group. Lucius curses and hurls himself into the relative but crowded safety of the coach, but a few of the guards do not have as much luck.\nThe air is filled with the rearing of horses and the screams of the wounded. The captain of the scouts turns to face the enemy, but gives only a gurgle, as you can see the black arrow protruding from his neck.\n\nBlood runs out of his mouth, and for a horrifying second, he seems to stare at you with the paincrazed eyes of the already dead, before falling from his horse only to be gored by the panicking beast.\n\nWhen you catch yourself again, you see that J'Arel and Lucius are already preparing spells, even if they cannot yet see who is attacking you.", "action_results": [{"action": "I will wait until it becomes clear who is attacking us and wherefrom.", "result": "You decide to stay in the relative safety of the coach.\n\nJ'Arel, suddenly engulfed in an aura of sizzling flames, jumps out of the coach and hurls a ball of fire in the general direction of the assault.\n\nLucius leaves the coach on through the other door, and immediatley the carriage is rocked by gusts of wind, which also cause the arrows to stray.\n\nOne arrow, however, flies straight at J'Arel's head - but it bursts into flame upon touching his aura.\n\nSomeone bellows a command over the screams of the guards, and those that survived the initial deadly onslaught charge off into the direction where the volleys came from.\n\nYou are considering your options, when suddenly a lightning strike that turns you blind and deaf turns J'Arel into a cinder, but not before you hear his piercing death scream and see, in minuite detail how the fire mage's skin peels off under the tremendous energy of the lightning.\n\nShocked, you decide to join the combat as quickly as possible, before the next strike perhaps hits the coach.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue...", "result": "Desperately, you attempt to get your bearing.\n\nFrom the twoscore warriors that accompanied the emissary's treck, only one dozen survived the initial deadly volley of black arrows.\nHowever, the guards are rallied and charge the enemy, apparently a group of about half a hundredship ragged looking beings you immediatley recognize as large goblins, led by a couple of their shamans. While a single goblin is no match for a human warrior, the shamans double the goblins' threat, and they make up in numbers what they lack in size.\n\nLucius is using his powers over the wind to make arrows useless, and most goblins have thrown their bows away and now wield evil looking barbed knives.\n\nOne guard, trying to charge through the goblins to strike down a shaman, is dragged from his horse, and both the guard and the poor beast soon disappear und the goblin's small twisted bodies.", "action_results": [{"action": "I am an adept of Fire.", "result": "The flame of the Spark is strong within you today, and your fingers itch with the desire to channel your magic.\n\nThis is it... this is how it feels to have an adventure!

With another ball of flame formed in your hand, intended to speed the goblin's flight, you turn to see that Farhan Brownhand, emissary of Alzur, has stabbed Lucius in the back with an evil looking sword that protrudes from the Air adept's chest.\n\nHe grins wickedly at you and makes a gesture with his offhand. Instinctively you hurl your fireball into his general direction, and throw yourself from the coach.\n\nJust in time, as it explodes under you, smouldering splinters burying themselves into your robes and into your flesh.\n\nShaking, you stand up, turning to Farhan and the spitted Lucius, and prepare another spell...", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue...", "result": "You stare disbelieving at Master Brownhand, and before you can launch a spell at him, he uses your hesitation to weave a quick strand of fire at you.\n\nYou barely dodge the small bolt of fire that jumps from his fingers and flies past you.\n\nSeeing he missed you, he curses and prepares another spell.

You throw yourself on the ground in midrun, just as the first guards pass you in the other direction, and, accompanied by a loud crackle, a searing pain blazes across your back, just before one of the guards in front of you emits a loud scream, and something bright hits him in the chest.\n\nAs you quickly jump to your feet again, bloodied and dirty, with a singed back, you hear another sizzle, a crackle, and then a double scream, as two guards that are running at Farhan are hit by more lightning.\n\nYou turn around, and the four remaining guards are about to swing their swords at the emissary, when suddenly, out of the shadow of the coach, Farhan's bodyguard, a bulky man that moves with the gracefulness of a cat, launches himself at the group of guards.\n\nFarhan turns to flee towards the hills, as his bodyguard snaps the neck of a guard with his bare hands.

He is a seasoned veteran, and you can see in his eyes the disgust for this treachery.\n\nThe horses drawing the coach are all either dead or have fled. Night is coming soon, and the road through the hills is known to be a dangerous way even in daylight. Bandits and bands goblins roam the area, as you were forced to experience yourself.\n\nThe plains are not much better. Any camp made on the way would be like a beacon to anyone searching for them, and neither Kor nor you have no doubts that Farhan will likely return - with or without help - to finish what the goblins had begun.\n\nAs a Magus, even a rather inexperienced one, the duty of leadership is on you, but Kor is ready with advice.\n\nBasically, you have only few options. You might attempt to travel back to the Acadamy and report of Farhan's treachery.\nOr, you might attempt to find him before he finds you. Teleport weaves, as Farhan has used to escape, are tricky: They are dangerous to pull off, because inexperienced adepts attempting to move their essence to somewhere else usually unravel themselves and get no second try.
