The thought came up to question why, but you've learned from experience not to question a woman on her hairstyle.\n\n\"Way ahead of you, V,\" you say raising your cup from the bar top for emphasis.\n\n\"I'll have what he's having,\" she addresses towards the bartender.\n\n\"Got any news on The Sanguine?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yeah, boss, and it's not good. Procter is working on the repairs now. He said we might need the hull replaced.\"\n\n\"I sure hope not,\" you reply.\n\n\u201cWe've been through worse, Cap,\u201d Victoria replies.\n\nYou take another sip from your cup. The latest job smuggling cargo for an English merchant paid well, but the damage sustained fleeing from a Spanish Galleon could very well cost the entire payout, or worse, put you in the hole. The wizard on board the Galleon hit The Sanguine with more than a few nasty spells. If Victoria didn't fire back with a perfectly aimed fire bolt, the entire ship might be at the bottom of the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cI sent Freddy to find us some work,\u201d you say to Victoria. \u201cDid he come back with anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing yet,\u201d she replies. \u201cAlthough knowing Freddy, he probably got distracted by the nearest gambling hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always comes through in the end, despite his tendencies,\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cWhat's next for you, Cap?\u201d Victoria asks.\n\nYou finish the cup and slam it back down on the bar top. Sunlight pours into the poorly lit building through several open windows creating rectangular beams of yellow. You're reminded of the Caribbean heat each time a wave of warm air floods in. Your crew had certainly seen better days. The last three ships you targeted weren't carrying anything substantial. Your most recent job would have been a huge payday if not for the Galleon's attack. At least you managed to escape alive and with most of your crew. Victoria's former life as naval mage certainly came in handy there.\n\n\u201cCap?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, V.

The bright sunlight assaults your eyes as you enter into the open. The tavern is one of many upon a windy sloped path. Various vendors with small shops line the cobbled pavement. You pass by a group of marching soldiers and tip your hat towards their stoic, blank expressions. Tension between Nassau and the English occupation was at an all-time high. The governor's hold over the city had been steadily declining for years. Criminal activity only escalated with the diminishing control. Still, the English possessed the best firepower and wizards in their employ. Witnessing arcane power in addition to modern weaponry, you didn't think there would be much of a rebellion without outside help. Steel and gunpowder was vastly overshadowed by the power of the elements.\n\nAs you continue on the road down the hill, your mind drifts to your crew.

You both served upon the HMS Eternity occasionally butting heads when it came to advising the captain. The two of you were considered Captain Newburry\u2019s \u201cright and left hands\u201d and were the primary reason the ship survived as long as it did. You did find it frustrating that Newburry sided with Victoria more, probably since it\u2019s hard to disagree with feminine beauty. Ironically, The Eternity went down under fire from the Spanish fleet, but not before you rescued Victoria\u2019s unconscious body on a piece of floating debris.\n\nThe two of you had gone your separate ways and met later in Port Maje. Uncharacteristically, Victoria had threatened her superior officers after being placed under another incompetent captain. Things escalated, a building or two burned down, and she was dishonorably charged from the Royal Navy. Her expertise when it comes to naval warfare has saved The Sanguine countless times.

Freddy didn't quite have the same progression, but once you took command of your own small vessel, you told your superior officer it was contingent upon Freddy's involvement.

Upon the dock, fishermen and sailors ready their boats with supplies. A few soldiers stand watch in obvious distaste towards their duty in the scorching heat. You don\u2019t understand why the military makes them wear the layered bright red uniforms, especially in the tropical heat. The uniforms are better suited towards the cloudy streets of London. It isn\u2019t your place to correct the decision of the English military, but if it were up to you, you\u2019d definitely adapt the uniforms to the surrounding environment.\n\nAfter passing a few fishing boats and a couple sloops, your view of The Sanguine is uninhibited. The dark oak body floats gracefully upon the clear ocean. Its double masts are like two aged trees rising above a clearing. The sails are in a raised position, and you long to see the white cloth full in the Caribbean wind.

As his man, Dampier, welcomes you through the front gate, you can\u2019t help but be mesmerized by the beauty of the finely trimmed flora, statues, and mansion. Someone of your nature always appreciates high-quality things, and can\u2019t help but wonder at its worth. Several guardsmen patrol through the well-maintained garden keeping a close eye on their employer\u2019s guest.\n\nThe mansion itself looks freshly built. There isn\u2019t a single crack or flaw in the paint, and the roofing tiles are placed perfectly together. As you draw near to the front door of the building, you see two, obviously Spanish, sculptures upon either side of the entryway. The things you\u2019ve heard about Rogers seem to be true. He made his wealth preying upon the Spanish fleet.\n\nYou follow Dampier into the mansion and to the dining room. Sitting at a long mahogany table, is Woodes Rogers. The table looks as if it can seat about twenty, and seeing a single man using it is almost comical. The first thing you notice about him, besides having a table too big, is the massive scar upon the side of his face. It looks as if he ate a bullet, and probably a Spanish one if you had to guess.\n\n\u201cYou know they have priests for that,\u201d you say sitting down and gesturing towards your face.\n\n\u201cPointing out someone\u2019s scar is hardly a way to begin a conversation,\u201d he replies. \u201cOh well, since we\u2019ve found ourselves here, I should explain myself. Yes, you\u2019re right. Any priest worth his salt could heal a simple scar, but I would not have this one healed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cI like what it represents.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting shot?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reminder of mortality. At any moment, I could lose this life at the simple pull of a trigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are other ways of reminding yourself,\u201d you say. \u201cWays that are\u2026more visually appealing. Marriage, for instance, comes to mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am already happily married, Captain. Sarah is back in England with my son and daughters. I did not ask you here to discuss familial matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf that, I am glad. I\u2019d need a few more of these to get through that discussion,\u201d you say holding up a dainty wine glass from the table.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know of Blackbeard\u2019s cutlass?\u201d Rogers abruptly asks.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s probably lost at sea along with the rest of Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge,\u201d you reply. \u201cI also know it was rumored to harness immense power. The kind of power that makes you the most feared man in the Atlantic\u2026if you believe that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d you retort.\n\n\u201cHa, fair point. I know where it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n\nRogers pulls a map from his inner jacket and places it on the table. \u201cBlackbeard was slain near the Carolinas far north of here,\u201d he says placing a finger on the map.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of the geographic location of the Carolinas,\u201d you say.\n\nIgnoring your comment he continues, \u201cAnd what do you know of the Cult of Quetzalcoatl?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to nothing,\u201d you answer. \u201cThey\u2019re ancient Aztecs obsessed with a wind serpent and dark magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than most people know,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cMy expeditions have discovered a smaller sect of the cult. Guardians of a powerful artifact supposedly forged from a scale of the wind serpent. Does this look familiar?\u201d\n\nRogers pulls another object from within his coat and places it next to the map. He carefully unravels the scroll displaying the image. The entire image is different shades of charcoal. In the center stands a massive pyramid-shaped temple with an almost unending staircase upward. Storm clouds gather at the very top. Within the clouds, a snake-like creature can barely be seen. You have to squint to make out its shadowy form. Upon a pedestal, in the center of the image, lies a single cutlass.\n\n\u201cSweet mother Mary that\u2019s\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201c\u2014Blackbeard\u2019s cutlass,\u201d Rogers finishes for you with a grin. Looking back to the map he continues, \u201cWithout an owner, the cutlass returns to its home where it waits for a worthy member to claim it. The ancient protectors believe whoever claims the cutlass is Quetzalcoatl incarnate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know where the home is?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cAn island in the Gulf. Only visible by viewing with a Quetzalcoatl headdress. Luckily, my expeditions have uncovered one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why do you need me?\u201d you ask. \u201cYou seem to have everything that you need.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas, I cannot leave Nassau now. I\u2019m in the middle of a big proposal with England that will very likely result in governorship. If I were to disappear for weeks, all my work would be for nothing. I can\u2019t afford to send one of my own men because I\u2019m fearful a rival would catch on. I need an honorable captain with no ties and the ability to prevail in dangerous circumstances. I need you, captain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose this is the part you make me an offer I simply can\u2019t refuse,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cEven better. I\u2019m making you an offer you don\u2019t want to refuse,\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of your ship\u2019s condition and will finance the entire repair. Going a step further, I\u2019ll finance the overhaul for any on-board improvements you see fit. You can keep whatever treasures you find just bring me the cutlass. Oh, and should you decide to accept my repairs and run, I\u2019ll put a bounty so large on your head that every privateer and their mother will be out for your blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cRogers, you have yourself a deal,\u201d you say offering out your hand and a grin.", "action_results": [{"action": "Set sail", "result": "Woodes Rogers paid for everything Procter asked for down to the tiniest detail.

He whirls his hands in the air, too dramatically for the spell, and finishes by stretching his arms towards the longboats. Beside him, Victoria rolls her eyes at his performance. In a split-second the boats appear to vanish from sight, although you know that\u2019s not the case. Procter reaches down and picks up two tiny objects: the longboats.\n\n\u201cOh no.

You feel the presence of someone. You turn to see three natives standing at the edge of the jungle. Their clothes look to be the same style as the headdress.

You pass by an accomplished-looking Procter holding a chicken affectionately to his breast. The dusty street continues out of the village passing the cluster of huts. It leads up a grassy hill where you see a lone tree at the top. The tree itself is blackened, as if it barely survived a fire. The overgrown grass surrounding the tree doesn\u2019t look affected by the fire. At the top of the hill, you get a full view of the temple.

Once again, you\u2019re back to hacking overgrown vines and branches blocking your path. After a few hours of hacking, whacking, and slashing, you discover a series of stone-carved statues. There are five of them total arranged in a crescent circle. Each cracked, moss-layered statue is a naked woman looking downward with hands in a prayer position barely covering the front of their chest. The sculptor definitely didn\u2019t skip over emphasizing their womanly attributes as their curves are much more than a natural woman's. At first glance they appear the same, but a more in-depth look suggests subtle changes between them.\n\n\u201cHave we been at sea too long or are these statues beautiful?\u201d one of the crew, Jack, asks.\n\nYou turn to blonde-haired youth. \u201cThey are quite alluring.

Freddy had many rings, too many for you to keep track of them all, but there\u2019s no doubt in your mind it\u2019s one of them. Freddy must have left it here as a breadcrumb to signify you\u2019re on his trail.\n\nHenry slowly walks towards the statues for a better look. At the last moment something catches your eye\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014wait, stop!\u201d you shout.\n\nToo late. The ground beneath Henry collapses under his weight. In an avalanche of dirt, he falls into the pre-dug pit. You rush to save him, but not quickly enough. You arrive to the edge of the pit just before Henry hits the bottom. It\u2019s not a far drop. Not even a lethal height. The sharpened pikes at the bottom are another story though. Henry lies unmoving held suspended in the air by three pikes. His eyes are still wide-eyed by the surprise fall.\n\n\u201cNo one else move,\u201d you command the remaining two members.

After half a day\u2019s march, and a remark from William about \u201cbeing harder than stone\u201d, you arrive on the outskirts of the temple.\n\nThe tree line cuts off almost immediately in front of the bridge-like pathway leading to the temple\u2019s staircase. The pathway is long and narrow with high walls on either side creating a bottleneck opening into the temple. The same pillar lines the walls, one on each side every 10 feet or so mirroring the one across. The pillars have a snake wrapped around them from base to top with two wings spread out in flight position.

The light rises in the air, spirals, and then floats down the stairs to the end of the pathway. It hits a circular dial on the ground. A bolt of lightning strikes the dial and causes you to look away from the flash.\n\nYou return your gaze to find a creature standing at the point of the lightning strike. It stands upright like a man, but that\u2019s the extent of its human likeness. It has the head of a wild dog and the body of a lizard. The dark fur around its face creep down its neck transitioning into scales mid-chest level. Its tail glides through the air almost as if weightless.

William throws a hatchet at the beast\u2019s head while Jack circles around to the outside to scatter potential targets. As Jack circles, the beast\u2019s tail catches him in the chest sending him flying into the nearest pillar. He slams into the stone leaving behind a crack and red stain.\n\nYou slice your sword at the scaly hamstring. Your blade bounces off without leaving a mark.

Static energy fills the air with a low hum.\n\n\u201cWilliam, watch out!\u201d you scream from under the beast.\n\nA bolt of lightning fires from the beast\u2019s mouth blasting a hole through William. The shock blackens the area surrounding the hole cauterizing fatal blow instantly. Its turns to you now, the same energy filling the air.

A few gold pieces? \u2018Wealth\u2019 is the bane of your existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat type of man would I be to go against my word?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe type of man who would possess the power to etch his name into history forever. I will allow you to pass. Do not fail me.\u201d\n\nXolotl disappears in a flash of light leaving you, Jack, and William alone. There\u2019s no sign of your missing crew and the entrance to the temple lies open. You make your way up the staircase.\n\nThe arched entryway leads you into the temple\u2019s outer chamber. The place looks as if a shell of its former glory. Ruined, decaying statues line the walls. Pieces of stone blocks lie scattered on the floor, the ceiling\u2019s cracks the obvious source. Braziers are in key locations, although in their unlit state they serve no real purpose. By the activity on the island, you were expecting the temple to be, well, not a graveyard. Then the more you think about it, it starts to make sense; you doubt very many, if any, would make it past Xolotl. Still, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean the temple is void of all danger. There is powerful magic keeping Xolotl at bay and for all you know that power could be directed at intruders as well. You step carefully sensing for traps.\n\nA steady beat diverts your attention away from your internal thoughts. The deep rumbling appears muted, and you guess there are many walls muffling the sound. Likewise as the temple is the obvious place to find the cutlass, it is likely the centerpiece of whatever ceremonial event was taking place. The drums signify another thing: the temple is not as deserted as the outer chamber looks.\n\nNavigating through the halls, you listen for the drum beat and head in the direction it is loudest. You arrive at a balcony overhanging a long rectangular room. At the far end sits an altar with a cutlass mounted on a stand. The staircase leading up to the altar is much larger than it should be, like it's a testament to the temple itself. The cutlass isn\u2019t what draws your attention though. A single celled cage sits on either end of the altar. Inside you see a bound and gagged Procter and Freddy. Several hooded figures stand between you and the altar. A few bang on drums just before the altar's steps. Their red robes are a darker color than the natives you first encountered.\n\n\u201cLook down there. We\u2019ve got to help them,\u201d William whispers pointing over the edge.\n\n\u201cOf course we do,\u201d Jack answers. \u201cAny ideas on how?\u201d\n\nYou interrupt, \u201cI\u2019ve got something in mind\u2026\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The plan", "result": "\u201cSeriously?

You judge you\u2019re about 30 feet in the air. Not a fatal height, but rescue missions tend to go better without broken legs. The side wall connecting the balcony to the bottom floor is cracked in several places. Unfortunately, the first crack is just out of reach. You leap forward arms stretch out for the hand hold. Your hands slide into the opening and grip it tightly. The sudden stop of your upper body causes your lower half to take the bulk of the momentum. You bend your knees slightly to absorb the impact without making a sound. You look down to see if anyone notices your acrobatics. All the hooded figures are still focused on their prayer. Now that the hard part\u2019s done, you climb down to the lower floor.\n\nThe lone figure at the back of the room has your attention. Keeping in the shadows, you sneak behind them. Your arms lock around their neck in a choke. As they struggle, you secure your hand behind their head tightening the grip. You eat a pointy elbow in the gut, but remain firm on the pressure. As your target flails, you catch sight of a flash of purple. Instantly, you release the choke and flip back the hood. Your face catches a fist in response to giving up the superior position.\n\n\u201cVictoria?\u201d you whisper. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?

Look,\u201d she gestures towards the altar.\n\nA lone figure silently steps towards the altar. The robed people in the room separate allowing a pathway. The figure is unlike the others in the room. He wears a black robe instead of red. The edges of the robe are blurred at first sight, but then you realize black smoke is emanating from the robe. Pistols line the figure\u2019s chest and limbs and the tips of his beard are lit with small flames. You recognize the figure.\n\n\u201cIs that\u2014\u201d Victoria starts.\n\n\u201cEdward Teach.

Unfortunately for them, the blade has not tasted blood in quite a while. What do you say, men? Should we feed the thirsty blade?\u201d\n\nA cheer echoes throughout the room. You realize the red robed figures must be Blackbeard\u2019s crew. Whatever power is binding Teach to this place, binds them as well. Ignited by their captain, the crew abandons their stoic, religious demeanor.\n\n\u201cI say we let them fight to the death then sacrifice the survivor! Quetzalcoatl deserves a worthy sacrifice,\u201d one man near the altar shouts.\n\n\u201cNo, sacrifice them both. The blade thirsts for blood,\u201d another suggests.\n\nThe room erupts into a frenzy of disagreeing ideas between the crew to the amusement of Blackbeard. He gives a wink to a caged Procter after someone shouts the idea \u201ccut out their beating hearts.\u201d Finally, he raises his arms to settle the dispute.\n\n\u201cI have decided.

Capture them!\u201d Blackbeard screams.\n\nThe crew erupts into a mad frenzy mobbing towards you. Luckily, the majority are only armed with simple ceremonial knives. Behind you, Victoria fires a barrage of magic missiles that explode into a few more smoke clouds. You draw your blade and parry the first several attacks. You sense the presence of two bodies behind you, and you turn to attack. It\u2019s William and Jack joining your side with their cutlasses drawn.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t let you have all the fun,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m having the time of my life,\u201d you sarcastically answer.\n\nYou take the offensive easily cutting down the robed crewman with their ill-equipped knives. You use the smoke as cover dodging and dashing like a spectre. Finally, all that\u2019s left is Blackbeard. He stands at the altar with Freddy pinned down, an obsidian knife in his other.\n\n\u201cA valiant effort. Perhaps you are a worthy successor,\u201d he says.\n\nYou approach the altar's steps with your blade point in front of you, \u201cLet him go, Teach. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who wield the blade must be prepared to give the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sacrifice would that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lifetime of servitude. The blade gives tremendous power to the wielder, but your soul is bound to it forever. I am destined to guard the blade until its successor proves himself worthy. Then my soul will be harvested inside with the others before me. It\u2019s the way it will always be. The blade demands blood and will feed upon the wielder unless its thirst is sated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not here to wield it for myself. My employer is the one who wishes to wield it,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cThen you are truly bound to him. Should you prove yourself worthy to take the blade and gift it to another, your duty as guardian will remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d you say. \u201cRelease Freddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Blackbeard answers plunging his knife into Freddy\u2019s chest.\n\nFreddy\u2019s eyes grow wide in shock at the sudden pain. The cloth around his mouth muffles his scream. Blackbeard kicks his body down the altar\u2019s steps landing Freddy at your feet.\n\n\u201cMadman!\u201d you scream and charge the steps.\n\nAn invisible force prevents you from taking the first step. You pull out your flintlock and fire it towards Blackbeard. The invisible force prevents your bullet as well.\n\nLaughing, Blackbeard opens the next cage with Procter inside. Bound and gagged, Procter can\u2019t offer any sort of resistance. Multiple fireballs explode against the force shield. Victoria\u2019s doing. Still bound, Procter utters a muffled noise. His eyes look up towards his forehead and he motions upward with his head. You know what he\u2019s telling you to do.", "action_results": [{"action": "Put on the headdress", "result": "Just as the island\u2019s invisibility had to be dispelled, perhaps the barrier had to be as well. You pull the Quetzalcoatl headdress from your pack and place it on. Instantly, you\u2019re able to cross the barrier onto the altar\u2019s steps. Just in time for Blackbeard to sink the knife into Procter.\n\n\u201cTeach, you\u2019re a dead man!\u201d you shout.\n\n\u201cHa-ha-ha, right you are,\u201d he shouts back with a smile.\n\nYou rip the head covering off and toss it to your allies behind you. You continue your rush towards Blackbeard. Your blade meets the obsidian dagger with a piercing screech. You thrust your blade expertly forward using feints to catch Blackbeard unaware. Almost with ease, he parries each strike. Even though you have the obvious reach advantage, Blackbeard masterfully blocks each of your swings.\n\nAttempting to break his defense, you fire a bolt of lightning from your other hand. The electric energy hits Blackbeard\u2019s chest and disappears in a wisp of smoke. He grins and reflects the energy back to you knocking you off your feet and down a few steps.\n\nJack and William join the fray rushing past your fallen body. You try to get up, but the jolt left your muscles spasming. William lets loose a series of uppercuts and forward thrusts while Jack circles around to flank. Same as your attack, Blackbeard\u2019s defense is impenetrable. Suddenly, Blackbeard draws a pistol from his chest and fires it directly into William\u2019s forehead. William\u2019s head snaps back in the impact and his body falls to the floor. The move angers Jack and he aggressively attacks from Blackbeard\u2019s flank. Without even moving his head, Blackbeard drops the pistol, grabs another, and fires it into Jack\u2019s gut. Jack\u2019s body hits the floor mid-charge, the momentum slides his body forward a few feet.\n\nFinally able to move, you rise to your feet. The bodies of your crew, your friends, lie scattered around you. Their blood pools and drips down the steps of the altar creating a red waterfall. Blackbeard stands at the top of the stairs waiting for you. Behind you, Victoria is stuck outside the barrier. Jack or William, whoever was last inside, didn\u2019t throw the headdress far enough. It\u2019s on the ground just within the invisible barrier. Victoria can\u2019t get in.\n\nYour eyes meeting Blackbeard's, you slowly traverse the steps up. He stands unmoving without emotion. You stand before him, the guardian of Quetzalcoatl\u2019s blade. The cutlass remains on the sword stand on the altar. Realizing your magic is ineffective, you attack once more with expertly guided strikes and combinations.\n\n\u201cNot many make it this far, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d he says knocking your sword aside. \u201cPerhaps you were meant to wield the blade. Perhaps if another guardian stood in your way you\u2019d succeed. I don\u2019t plan on harboring my soul in the cutlass anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t plan on dying anytime soon,\u201d you reply with another series of strikes.\n\nTired of the game, Blackbeard parries your blade aside and knocks you back against the altar. His dagger pierces into your chest.\n\n\u201cAnd look how close you\u2019d gotten,\u201d he mocks as you lean against the altar clutching your wound.\n\nSuddenly a sword tip appears at his chest releasing a small whiff of smoke. Jack collapses behind Blackbeard, his final amount of energy placed into thrusting his sword forward. In Blackbeard\u2019s distracted state, you reach for the cutlass on the altar, screaming in pain. As soon as your hand clasps around the hilt, your vision flashes a supernatural green. Strength pours into your limbs like you\u2019ve never felt before. The wound from Blackbeard\u2019s mends itself closed. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re weightless; the energy flowing through your body feels limitless. With your new found strength you swing the blade down cutting Blackbeard from neck to hip. His body slides downward at the cut and then explodes into dark energy. Black smoke from his body surround you with a piercing scream. Then it pours itself into the cutlass in a rush of air.\n\nBlackbeard is dead and the cutlass is yours. You return to Victoria holding the blade.\n\n\u201cWe did it,\u201d you say showing her the cutlass.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she answers. \u201cXolotl needs it destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you gained access to the temple,\u201d you ponder. \u201cThe \u2018power\u2019 Xolotl is offering sounds too good to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds better than being eternally bound to Quetzalcoatl...or following a captain into ruin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean,\u201d you say narrowing your eyes.\n\n\u201cIt means I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fit to lead anymore,\u201d Victoria says. \u201cIt means I won\u2019t continue to follow you while our crew gets destroyed in the process. We\u2019ve fallen on hard times, and it\u2019s a captain\u2019s duty to protect and prosper the crew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think this job is for!\u201d you reply. \u201cThe Sanguine is now the most destructive force in the Caribbean. We can do what we please. The Spanish, French, not even the English can face us in open water now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may have the ship, but we no longer have the crew,\u201d Victoria says gesturing towards the fallen bodies. \u201cI will rebuild The Sanguine\u2019s crew...as captain.\u201d Victoria\u2019s palm ignites with flame. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking that cutlass now.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Hand it over", "result": "\u201cFine,\u201d you answer. \u201cI\u2019ve lost too many friends already.

Her eyes roll back in her head as she experiences the same rush of power.\n\n\u201cThis is something else,\u201d she comments. \u201cBut it won\u2019t compare to the gift of Xolotl. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nVictoria leads you back out of the temple with the cutlass pointed at your back. You exit the temple and arrive at the circle Xolotl appeared at earlier.\n\n\u201cXolotl! I have the artifact!\u201d Victoria shouts into the air.\n\nIn another lightning strike, Xolotl appears at the circle. His canines point menacingly from his lips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he growls. \u201cPlace the blade on the dial.\u201d\n\nVictoria does as he says. Xolotl raises his arms up to the air drawing upon supernatural power. Dark storm clouds begin to circle above you in the air. The bright sunlight turns dark as if night had suddenly come. A blinding light fires from the sky directly to the dial\u2019s center. A pillar of flame fires from the clouds followed by several lightning strikes. Pain pierces your chest as the cutlass begins to crack from the elemental burst. The cutlass begins to emit a low light from within that increasingly grows larger. As the cutlass\u2019 light grows to crescendo, you feel the energy drawing you in. You feel your life force drawn into the cutlass just before it\u2019s shattered into countless pieces. Your time of guarding the cutlass was brief. As the blade is destroyed, so is your soul.

The bolt hits the blade and is dispelled upon impact. Victoria gives a surprised look and then fires another. Reactively, you dodge to the left. Though you may possess a magic dispelling blade, you\u2019re certainly not used to using it. The blast hits the wall behind where you stood and explodes in a cluster of flame and stone.\n\n\u201cV, I don\u2019t want to fight. Stop, and we can forget about this whole thing,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Xolotl expects me to follow through.

She deserves better.\u201d\n\nVictoria continues to fire towards you. This time you raise the cutlass defensively. Like someone whispered in your ear, you know exactly what to do. Right when the spell hit the blade, you imagine returning the firebolt back towards Victoria. The bolt, along with the previous, projects from the cutlass in Victoria\u2019s direction. You\u2019ve seen her absorb magical attacks before, but this one catches her unaware. The blast explodes at Victoria\u2019s chest blasting her backward. After the smoke clears, all that remains is a charred body with few strands of purple hair left. You have possession of the blade, but all your closest friends are dead. You exit the temple, blade in hand.\n\nA lightning strike greets you as you exit onto the temple\u2019s steps.

Xolotl tries to stomp his massive feet on top of you, which you easily side step and counter with several deep cuts.\n\nXolotl begins to rear his head gathering focus. A blast of lightning fires from his mouth toward you. Trusting in the cutlass, you allow it to absorb the blast. Acquainted with the power, you silently tell it to return the shock. Blue tendrils release from the point of the blade striking Xolotl in the eye. Xolotl screams as he falls to the ground clutching at the hole where his eye once resided.\n\nYou walk to the beast writhing on the ground and lift the cutlass.\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d you start. \u201cWhat fool would surrender Quetzalcoatl\u2019s blade for your \u2018power\u2019?\u201d\n\nYour sword, the resting place of Quetzalcoatl, removes Xolotl\u2019s head with a single blow.\n\nThe rest of the crew waiting on board The Sanguine are relieved at your return, but the moment is tainted with the death of the others. You preserve Victoria\u2019s memory, and don\u2019t tell the crew of her mutinous attack. Weeks later you dock in Nassau.

You unsheathe the blade for a closer look. The removal from the scabbard sounds similar to chimes on a windy day.

We'll meet back here in a few days\"\n\nVictoria nods and ventures off leaving you with only Jack and William.\n\nDays later...\n\nYou continue to wait. No Victoria. It\u2019s well past the time she should be here.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I think I saw movement,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\u201cVictoria?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cNot sure. It came from over there,\u201d he points a finger into the jungle in front of you.\n\nYou peer into the overgrowth. You don\u2019t see anything, but a whizzing sound causes you to instinctively roll to your right. The feathered javelin hits Jack square in the chest. Two more quickly follow impaling his stomach as he falls back. The points rip clean through his back stopping his fall a few inches from the ground.\n\nStaying in the same spot too long has alerted the natives to your presence. Perhaps they wouldn\u2019t have attacked if you didn\u2019t attack them first on the beach. A group of natives appear through the trees encircling you and William.

He\u2019s obviously enjoying the view and plays a song recounting the story of \u201cFrancis, the Eternal Emperor.\u201d His music seems to invigorate the crew because they suddenly begin to work with extra might.\n\nIn front of you Procter barks commands making sure the crew is properly armed and the guns are reloaded quickly. At one point, you see him toss back a sailor for not \u201cputting enough back\u201d into his rope pulling and takes the rope himself. A bored-looking Victoria sends a series of magic missiles onto the deck of El Explorador for good measure. By now, most of your crew is engaged with El Explorador\u2019s and you figure it\u2019s time to end things before any of your more reckless members lose their life.\n\n\u201cV, let\u2019s give them the ol\u2019 slip-out-while-they\u2019re-in-the-washroom special,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cWe really need to come up with a better name for this,\u201d she says starting to cast the alteration spell.\n\nMagic fires from her fingertips enveloping you into a shimmering, transitive state. Light seems to ignore your body as you turn into the transparent form. Only noticeable by highly perceptive individuals, you jump across the gap to El Explorador.\n\nYou soften your landing with a front roll and draw the dagger from your thigh. With the crew of El Explorador distracted by the battle, you make your way cutting through the preoccupied men. Eventually their captain notices the bodies falling by an unseen foe and directs the nearest soldiers in your direction. They take aim and unload a series of musket shots into the air. You manage to evade the shots by ducking underneath one of their fallen members.\n\nYou throw the dead body aside, and cast a light spell temporarily blinding the soldiers. Not wasting any time, you stab the nearest soldier with your sword and throw your dagger into another. With one hand free, you draw the flintlock from your hip and fire it into the third soldier. The sound of air whizzing past, followed promptly by a resounding thud draws you from the heightened state of battle. You turn to see the ship\u2019s captain on the deck behind you with several throwing knives lodged in his chest. You look up to the crow\u2019s nest of The Sanguine and give Freddy a salute. He returns the gesture with a toothy grin.\n\nWith their captain dead, the rest of the crew throws down their arms in surrender. You raid their cargo hold and find a significant amount of Spanish wine. You load the wine onto The Sanguine and offer a choice to the surviving members of El Explorador: Join or die. All but one join your crew, and Procter is excited that he gets to test his new plank courtesy of Woodes Rogers.

We\u2019re going to split the Spanish dogs in half!\u201d\n\nYou spin the wheel to the right. The Sanguine responds accordingly directing its path perpendicular to El Explorador. A gust of wind catches the sails propelling the schooner to frightening speeds. You see the Spanish crew horrified at the approaching missile that is The Sanguine. Most begin to jump ship.\n\nVictoria was almost right. The bow of The Sanguine tears into El Explorador with a sickening crunch. The port side is ripped apart and looks as if cracks from an earthquake. The Sanguine\u2019s momentum stops just short of reaching the starboard side of El Explorador. The impact renders most of the Spanish soldiers unless as they\u2019re either thrown from the ship or crushed by debris. Several fires start along the deck and the sailors frantically rush to put them out.\n\nEnergized by the destruction, your crew jumps to El Explorador cutting down the remaining members and salvaging any valuables before the Caribbean claims it.

The sudden sunlight in contrast to the dimly-lit tavern assaults your vision. You tip the point of your tricorn hat a bit lower to protect your eyes. The tavern is one of many upon a windy, sloped path. You pass by several street shops lining the cobbled pathway. A group of expressionless soldiers march by and receive a smile and tip of your hat. Tension between Nassau and the English occupation was at an all-time high. The governor's hold over the city had been steadily declining for years. Criminal activity only escalated with the diminishing control. Still, the English possessed the best firepower and wizards in their employ.\n\nEventually you end up at a table underneath a covered patio. The entire overhang is covered with a green ivy. Three men sit at the table along with a crowd eagerly huddled around the players. You see Freddy in the middle always with a perfectly trimmed goatee. You never know how he finds the time, especially at sea, to trim each hair to the exact desired length. He holds his cup of dice with the usual several rings upon his fingers.\n\n\u201cNot your lucky day, is it Freddy?\u201d one man at the table speaks.\n\n\u201cNo one can lose this many times in a row,\u201d he replies. \u201cMy luck\u2019s about to change\u2026 and your coin purse is about to get lighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa-ha, you\u2019ve already lost several months of wages,\u201d the other man chimes in. \u201cPretty soon you\u2019ll be putting those fancy rings on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Freddy replies taking a ring from each pointer finger.\n\n\u201cCall,\u201d both his opponents say simultaneously and push their coin piles forward much to the amusement of the crowd.\n\nThe three players shake their cups, rolling their dice, and slam the cups upside-down on the table. Then, they carefully peak underneath to see the result being careful not to let their opponent see.\n\n\u201cFour fours,\u201d one man speaks.\n\n\u201cFive fours,\u201d the other one bets.\n\n\u201cEight fours,\u201d Freddy says.

Between the two of them, they have three fours.\n\n\u201cHa-ha-ha it\u2019s still not your day, Freddy!\u201d\n\nFreddy lifts his cup to reveal his roll. Each of the five dice shows a four.

As Freddy rose to greet you, his two opponents had taken their coin back and run off.\n\n\u201cDamn, and we still had several more rounds to play.
