You rush  to keep up with father, who is seemingly oblivious to how fast you\u2019re having to walk.\n\n\n\u201cCome on, boy!\u201d father said, his fingers scratching at his thick black mustache.\n\n\nAs you walked out of the confines of the tight pines, you saw home. The stone and thatch cottage that was to be your home for the next few years, until you became of age to find your own place, stood there in the fields. Overgrown fields lay to the West and South, a trickling stream East and the vast forest you\u2019d been walking to took up the North. Judging from the cart sitting alongside it, Mother and Meredith were already here.\n\n\nThe family was tiny by all accounts. Mother was prone to bouts of sickness, making her womb a barren place for a child to be born. Although they had tried all their life, and continued trying despite even you recognizing the futility of the action, two children was all they\u2019d ever have. It was you and Meredith, the \u201cmiracle twins\u201d as the doctor who delivered you liked to say, that would be the only ones that had survived. The number of miscarriages had clearly taken its toll on Mother, who was fond of siting my the fire, staring into it as she said her rosaries. From Father\u2019s stories she was a wild and untamed girl as a child, a rebellious soul that Father had been ensnared by. Whoever Father speaks so fondly off, its no longer Mother.\n\n\nFather still retained some joy, a love of the land and and a love of nature, although the glimmer of excitement in his eyes was becoming rarer and rarer as time passed.\n\n\nThat left Meredith. While father\u2019s love of nature and positive nature had been instilled in you when you were younger when Father still held the hope of a large family that Mother had long abandoned, Mother\u2019s cold, distant nature took hold of Meredith. She wasn\u2019t as bad as mother, but she was a pain to play with and even worse to talk to.\n\nAll in all, this turned you into the child you are. Without many friends, you\u2019ve become quite lonely, but there is a certain peacefulness in nature you just adore. With the birds nesting in the trees singing to you, the hares bounding carefree underfoot among the undergrowth and eyes of a thousand beasts and creatures staring at you, you could never truly be lonely in the woods. You\u2019d do your chores and feel the burden of labor required to survive in such a harsh time, but then, you were free to walk under the protection of the greak oaks and pines and gaze at the glory of nature.\n\n\nYou run down along the fields, hefting the weight of the rifle in your hands as father jogs ahead. Soon, you run up to the porch to find mother and Meredith unpacking. You put your gun in the rack, looking at them.\n\n\n\u201cWhat can I do now, father?\u201d you ask.    \n\n\n\u201cNothing, boy. It\u2019s up to mother and Meredith to do the unpacking and prepare the catch, Papa says, pulling off his hunting sack and pulling out two hares, their necks broken. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Get the bearings of the forest for me, lad. Scout out for any hare paths or wild fruit growing or deer grazing areas.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot it, father,\u201d you nod, grabbing your rifle once more and swinging around to walk back outside again.
