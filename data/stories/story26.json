The glade explodes with magical aura as the unicorn releases its legendary rainbow fart. Magical anomalies, such as this, signal only one thing: the birth of a hero.\n\n\nElfmoor takes a big whiff of the magical aroma. \u201cB. E. A. Utiful. Times like this make life worth living.\u201d\n\n\nElfrond shakes his head. \u201cElfmoor, we\u2019re immortal. I\u2019ve seen this like ten times already.

And they say chivalry is dead.\n\n\nYou are born into a loving but stern peasant family in the hamlet of Forest Hill. Your formative years are a medley of hardship, merriment, and hard work. While most of the other children in the hamlet are content to play ragamuffin children\u2019s games and live out their lives in this quaint corner of the woods, you aspire to greatness, spending every evening selling turnips and every night mucking shit from the stables. With all this (paltry sum of) loot, you are able to afford sword and shield lessons from the guardsmen.\n\n\nOne fine autumn evening, you and your sword master Jon are finishing a sparring session.  Jon is bigger and faster than you are, but you have taken his lessons to heart. Training swords are blunted, but they hurt all the same when they whack you.\n\n\nJon\u2019s sword arcs toward your shoulder. You raise your shield, and the wood splinters. With a quick twist of the wrist, you yank the shield downwards, catching Jon\u2019s sword in the process. He is open; here is your chance. You swing your sword\u2026\n\n\n\u201cDodge!\u201d you shout, dropping to the ground. Jon\u2019s fist sails an inch above your head. You toss your shield and lurch from your knees into Jon. The pair of you grapple on the ground. Dust flies. Both of your swords are lost in the ruckus.\n\n\nA fist catches you square in the gut. Once, twice, three times. You spit in Jon\u2019s eyes and roll to the side, and stagger to your feet. A leg comes sweeping toward you.\n\n\n\u201cDodge!\u201d you shout, jumping back. You avoid the leg, but tumble onto your ass. Before you can regain your feet, a boot hits your chest, shoving you back into the ground.\n\n\nJon stands above you and smirks. \u201cYou know what you forgot to do?\u201d\n\n\nYou nod, knowing.\n\n\n\u201cYou forgot to DODGE!\u201d\n\n\nYou share a hearty laugh. At first, Jon would shout \u2018dodge\u2019 to train you to avoid taking hits, now it is your job to shout it when you train. He even sends kids around to throw shit at you randomly during the day. That really sends the message home. You have come so far that the art of dodging has almost become a sixth sense. \u2018If they can\u2019t hit you, they can\u2019t kill you,\u2019 Jon had reasoned.\n\n\nThe pair of you head to the watch house to clean up. The building is small and reeks of sweat and mildew. The hamlet only has three guards, so upgrading their housing has not been a top concern of the local Baron. You are just thrilled the hamlet has guards at all.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting good, kid. Real good,\u201d says Jon, stripping his leather armor. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready for some real patrol work.

Peasantry blows.\n\n\nUnder cover of darkness, you and the three guards head out along the Baron\u2019s Road in the back of a covered wagon. No one has ever thought of ambushing bandits in a covered wagon while guised as merchants. Surely, the plan will go off without a hitch.\n\n\nSamwellington the Fat jitters in his seat. You are not sure if it is because he is scared or hungry. How Sam became a member of the guard is beyond your imagination. Jon trusts him for some reason, and that is good enough for you. \u201cNervous kid?\u201d he asks.\n\n\nThat you might eat me. \u201cNo. If Jon says I\u2019m ready, then I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\nBowie bobs his head. \u201cIt\u2019s best to trust Jon.

It\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d\n\n\nBlood loss is making you delusional. It is the only way to explain what is happening. Samwellington draws his dagger and sticks himself in the gut.

Samwellington gulps and scurries away to hide behind the wreckage of the wagon. What a coward. Oh well, at least he saved your life.\n\n\nLeaning against your sword, you stagger to your feet. One of the trolls ravages Bowie\u2019s headless corpse. The crunching and snapping of bones sickens you, and you fight the urge to hurl as bile tickles your throat. Jon appears to be holding his ground against the other troll, but once his friend finishes devouring Bowie\u2019s corpse, even Jon won\u2019t be able to fend off their combined savagery.

A deep sadness seeps into your bones as you hear the troll crunch your arm in its jaws. Heroes are not supposed to be eaten.\n\n\nJon slices the back of the trolls\u2019 knees, and the troll howls in agony as its legs buckle.

Nice job yourself. You didn\u2019t even need to have your sword arm attached to the rest of your body for it to be useful. Try dodging next time though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will be a next time. How can I fight without a sword arm?\u201d\n\n\nJon winks. \u201cI know a guy: magic fellow and what not. He should be able to do something for you.\u201d Jon raises his hand. \u201cHold on one second. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\nJon darts into the forest and you hear the lovely sound of steel biting into flesh and the accompanying screams.\n\n\n\u201cSam, why don\u2019t you go back to the hamlet and draft the report,\u201d says Jon, emerging from the forest, \u201cadd five dead bandits to it. I\u2019ll take our buddy here to the hedge wizard.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, you and Jon part ways with Samwellington and enjoy a relatively droll venture to the hedge wizard\u2019s hut. You understand why he is only a hedge wizard. The hut is a ramshackle smattering of twigs and leaves that appear to be held together by nothing but mud and bird poop. The entire place smells worse than a popcorn fart. This may not have been the best idea, but before you can raise your concerns with Jon, he hollers out.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Osprey, get out here. I need a favor.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that you Jon?\u201d You hear weird pops and bangs from inside the bird poop hut. \u201cJust a second.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d says Jon. \u201cNo hurry.\u201d\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, a bent white-bearded man with smoldering eyebrows and a staff teeters out of the hut amidst a cloud of smoke. The smoke shrouds Osprey and follows him around. It smells of rancid cheese and burning bird shit.\n\n\n\u201cWhew,\u201d Jon attempts to wave the stink away, \u201cwhat were you doing in there?\u201d\n\n\nOsprey\u2019s eyes light up. His lips twist into a smirk as he cackles. \u201cWizard things.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, Dear God.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey\u2019s smile vanishes as he notices you and totters over. He grabs your head in both hands, lifts your chin, peers into your eyes, and prods your chest with a bony finger. A chill courses through your bones. He proceeds to violate your personal space for several minutes while you do your best to avoid suffocating in the smoke.\n\n\n\u201cMmhmmm,\u201d he says to himself. \u201cJust as I thought. The boy is missing an arm.\u201d\n\n\nYou roll your eyes. \u201cHow observant.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey whacks you upside the head with the staff. \u201cMind your manners, boy, or I\u2019ll turn you into a leprechaun.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing sadder than a leprechaun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot even a smelly old man living in a bird shit hut?\u201d\n\n\nOsprey clobbers you with the staff again. \u201cI\u2019ll have respect from you boy. This is no joking matter.

I can fix you right up. Get you a brand new ethereal arm. Those things are sweet: impervious to physical damage.

You might rip something important off.\u201d\n\n\nYou gulp.\n\n\nOsprey cackles and slaps you some more. He seems to like hitting you. \u201cYou can shoot magic energy blasts out of that thing too. I thought that might be useful for a hero.\u201d\n\n\nJon shakes his head. \u201cIf you want to be a heroic knight, don\u2019t do that. Knights aren\u2019t magic. Only trouble can come of it. This isn\u2019t a wizard\u2019s tale.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey shrugs and wanders back into his hut. The door creaks shut and you soon hear the calamity snap back to life. He pokes his head out to offer one last piece of advice. \u201cYou treat them leprechauns with respect, boy, you hear me?\u201d He slams the door shut and that is that.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d you ask Jon.\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go back to the hamlet and make sure everything\u2019s in order.

With the help of several drunken and boisterous natives, you learn the not-so-secret location of the Valley of Rainbows where the leprechauns supposedly abound. They warn you not to go though because it is a sad and wretched place. Obviously, you ignore them.\n\n\nHundreds of rainbows dot the easy to access valley, and you have little difficulty tracking one down to its end.

She is nothing less than a dark chocolate goddess sent from the heavens themselves.\n\n\nShe notices you staring and rubs her nipples. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Mam.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe too.\u201d She winks and blows a kiss. \u201cThink your cute?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can bet your scantily clad ass and bosom I do. I\u2019m a generic hero after all. Being cute is in the job description.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOoooooo, a generic hero turned renegade! That really turns me on. I\u2019m so wet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, all this rain is getting me soaked too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCute and funny! We\u2019re going to have a lot of fun tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI try to have fun every night. I love games. Do you like games?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I just orgasmed. See that tent? Five minutes. Be there.\u201d\n\n\nThe ebony bandit princess saunters off, leaving you alone to complete your dark deed. Looking forward to countless nights of games and fun, you duck into the tent to kill Jon and Samwellington. They are blindfolded, bound, and gagged. They won\u2019t even know you betrayed them!\n\n\nYou raise your sword to do the deed, but before you can deliver the stroke, all the wonderful memories you had training under Jon stream through your mind. You remember the first time he taught you to dodge, the first time he had a random ragamuffin kid in the hamlet throw piles of shit at you, the time he told you what a clitoris is, and the time he first taught you that survival sometimes means kicking the enemy in the balls.\n\n\nShit I dunno if I can do this.\n\n\nPerfectly understandable, but I assure you the ebony bandit princess is the only ebony chick in this universe. Is your friendship worth giving that up? She is unique, one-of-a-kind, like a special edition Poke\u2019mon.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ebony bandit princess, I choose you!", "result": "How positively villainous, betraying your best friend and teacher. You kill Jon with a discreet thrust to the heart. Samwellington takes a little more work since you have to cut through all the fat, but in the end, the deed is done. I hope you are proud of yourself.\n\n\nWith a minute to spare, you enter the tent the ebony bandit princess demanded. You play games together all night long, every night for years to come. Eventually, you take over and become the new bandit leader, earning a fortune in the bacon smuggling trade. Life couldn\u2019t be better for a bandit king.\n\n\nFor awhile you feared the ghosts of Jon and Samwellington would return to the living world and haunt you for your atrocious crimes, but thankfully you are left in peace.\n\n\nOne night you die of a heart attack while playing your nightly game with your ebony bandit princess turned queen. The absurd amount of bacon consumption probably had something to do with that. Before you were forced to enter your happy place all those years ago, you had been able to suppress your bacon cravings. Since then you could never resist the urge. Alas, life treated you well all the same.\n\n\nThe afterlife does not.

You are a hero goddamn it, and being a hero sometimes means letting the legendary Poke\u2019mon roam free. For whatever reason, the bandits just assumed you would kill your friends and did not even bother maintaining a guard on you until you actually did the dastardly deed, which makes freeing Jon and Samwellington astonishingly droll.\n\n\nSamwellington maintains the status quo by squealing incomprehensible gibberish. The fellow is nothing if not consistent.\n\n\nFreed from his bindings, Jon decks you in the jaw and kicks you in the groin once you hit the ground. \u201cNever. Call. Me. A. Fucking. Bastard.\u201d He kicks you once again for good measure.\n\n\nYou curl into a ball and wheeze. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\n\nWith that out in the air, Jon reverts to all smiles and rainbows and helps you back to your feet. \u201cGood. Thanks for cutting us loose. Ready to settle the score on these pricks?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, just give me a minute.

They prove as unprepared and hapless as they have so far demonstrated. Stab, dodge, slash, hack, dodge, dodge, slash, dodge, stab. Soon enough only the bandit leader and the ebony bandit princess remain.\n\n\n\u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done!\u201d he shouts. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll just stand for this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you just stood around and scratched your nuts all day,\u201d you say. \u201cThis is a pretty piss poor operation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou piss pot! You threw away the opportunity of a lifetime. You could have had an ebony bandit princess. I was going to look at you as a son! Now you\u2019ll never find true love or happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy uncle always said, \u2018Every piss pot has its lid.\u2019 I\u2019ll find mine some day.\u201d\n\n\nThe bandit leader draws his scimitar and discards his cape. Oh snap, he means business now. \u201cYou son of a peasant! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d The bandit leader darts forward with the speed of a black mamba.\n\n\nYou dodge the attack like a pro. The bandit leader moves to strike again, but his own daughter stabs him in the back.\n\n\nThe ebony bandit princess points to the same tent she did earlier. \u201cYou. Me. Tent. Now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYay, I love games!\u201d you cheer as you follow her into the tent.\n\n\nWell, well, well nice going hero. You have your cake and you get to eat it out too. Life goes on and you and Jon eventually receive knighthoods for your valiant efforts in your ongoing adventures. Samwellington continues to provide\u2026 company if nothing else.\n\n\nEver since you entered your happy place, you have had difficulty resisting the succulent allure of bacon.
