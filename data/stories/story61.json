He told you they made him eat maggots and kept asking him for information he didn\u2019t even have, not that he would have given it to them if he had, he said.

The bad stories probably never saw the light of day. With this guy, the North Koreans thought he was lying and so they jammed metal files under his nails or just beat him up all the time.
