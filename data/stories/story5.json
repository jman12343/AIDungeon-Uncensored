You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n\u201cHey Jake.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Ian, ready for another exciting day?\u201d You ask sarcastically.\n\n\u201cOh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.\u201d He replies with equal sarcasm, \u201cI hope I never quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lifelong-dream. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, it\u2019s time to live that dream.\u201d\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there\u2019s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it\u2019s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o\u2019clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.", "action_results": [{"action": "A strange dream", "result": "You blink your eyes and look at your new surroundings. You\u2019re alone in the middle of a classroom, a very familiar classroom. Glancing down you notice you\u2019re sitting in a desk and that there\u2019s a small \u2018J\u2019 carved into the bottom right of its surface. This is your desk. At least it was, some point in time many years ago. Bringing your attention back up you notice the class is now filled with other students, each sitting in their own desks frantically writing notes. You don\u2019t recognize any of them, or rather you can\u2019t since none of their faces are clear to you. A teacher stands at the front of the class by the blackboard, presumably lecturing, though you all you can hear are muffled words.\n\nYou idly glance around the room and notice something out of place. A girl stands in the doorway, with long blonde and pink hair, flowing down to just above her waist. You stare at her for a while, trying to remember who she might be. No one else in the class pays any attention to her, and like the rest of them, you can\u2019t seem to make out her face. Suddenly, she turns around and runs down the hallway.\n\nYou stand up and walk out of the classroom, ignored completely by the rest of the class. As you enter the hallway, you look down the way you saw her ran, but see no one. Curious, you continue down the seemingly endless hallway trying to find her. Finally, you seem to reach the end, as a black metal door now blocks the path. Grasping the handle, you push it open. A bright light emits from the inside, blinding you and preventing you from seeing what\u2019s beyond the door. Curiosity gaining the better of you, you close your eyes and step through the doorway.", "action_results": [{"action": "The other side", "result": "\u201cJacob, wake up it\u2019s time for school!\u201d\n\nYou hear a familiar voice yell to you, and you groggily wake up in response.\n\nWhat a strange dream...\n\nYou try and remember the girl from your dream, but can\u2019t figure out who she was. The classroom was probably from your high school, but as far as you can remember that girl was never in any of your classes. You shrug and proceed to get up. After all, high school was years ago, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for you to forget a few people in that time.\n\nOnce fully awake, the reality that you live alone dawns on you; there should be no one yelling for you to wake up. Then another thought occurs, you don\u2019t go to school anymore either. Confused, you stand up and walk over to your dresser, which seems different from usual. Opening your drawers you notice your clothes seem different as well. Now even more confused, you get dressed and exit your room to find some answers. Outside your door you find your younger sister standing in front of you, in the uniform that she wore during high school. That is to say, while she has the same face, green eyes, and short brown hair as your sister, she looks considerably younger than she should.\n\n\u201cMom says wake up.\u201d She states quietly, then turns to walk away.\n\n\u201cUm, Tina?\u201d you say, trying to confirm it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d, she replies softly, turning towards you.\n\n\u201cAh, um, never mind. I\u2019m up.\u201d\n\nShe nods and walks away. You return to your room and look for your backpack, the one you remember using in high school. Sure enough you find it, right beside your dresser. You open it and grab one of your notebooks, hoping to confirm what you think has happened. You turn to the last note in the book and look at the date:\n\nApril 24th, 2008\n\nYou walk to your bed and sit down, trying accept what has happened. Yesterday was April 23th, but the year was 2018. Ten years ago you were 18 and in your last year of high school. The fact that your sister was in her private high school uniform confirms this, since she was in her first year of high school when you were in your last. Your thought process is interrupted by the familiar yell of your mother.\n\n\u201cJacob, hurry up! You\u2019re going to be late!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no point in thinking over this any longer. You quickly grab your bag and head down the stairs to the front door.\n\n\"Remember, you need wake up early on Saturday to bring your sister to school, since I'll be working.\"\n\nYour mother tells you, as she stands beside you watching you put on your shoes. You nod quickly in response, and although you\u2019re tempted to hug her or say you\u2019ve missed her, you put it off. The you in the past wouldn\u2019t have done it, so you\u2019re not going to do it either. After all, if this really is the past then doing something different could screw up the future in a major way.\n\nYou open the door and find Ian standing in front of you.

Ian tells you some story involving his older brother but you don\u2019t really pay attention. The thought that you\u2019re ten years in the past is all you can think about.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\nIan pushes your shoulder once you reach the entrance of the school and the two of you stop. He has a concerned look on his face.\n\n\u201cYou alright? You sick or something?\u201d\n\nHe asks.\n\n\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m fine.

You walk down the hallway a little further before opening up your bag in hopes of finding some sort of clue telling you where you\u2019re supposed to be. Inside you find various notebooks and textbooks, but nothing concerning your schedule. You sigh and notice the hallway is now completely empty.\n\nThe final bell which marks the start of class should be ringing any minute and you have no idea where you\u2019re supposed to be. Unsure of what to do, you decide to sprint down the hallway and look for whatever seems familiar.

However, apart from her no one else looks familiar, so this isn\u2019t your class. This is further confirmed when the teacher begins speaking to you.\n\n\u201cWhy hello, Jacob. Did you miss me and my class so much you felt compelled to return?\u201d\n\nYou grin, unable to withhold a sarcastic reply.\n\n\u201cYes, yes I did. May I have a seat?\u201d\n\nThe teacher smiles, amused you played along.\n\n\u201cSadly no, you will have to return to your classroom.\u201d\n\nShe then points you to the door.

He strokes his short beard while glaring at you.\n\n\"So, Jacob, I see you've arrived late.\"\n\nHe says in a angry tone. Luckily, and unfortunately, it seems like this is in fact your current class, which makes you late. The rest of the class joins him in staring at you as you awkwardly nod in response. You've never been particularly nervous in front of crowds, but you still dislike being the center of attention for a negative reason.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand this means you will have detention after school today.\"\n\nHe continues in a demeaning tone. Again you nod in response and quickly take a seat, trying to ignore the majority of the stares in the class.\n\n\"Now then class, reviewing what we learned yesterday...\"\n\nThe teacher says, beginning his lecture as he turns to face the blackboard. You pay attention for the first few minutes, as a sort of apology for being late, but you quickly lose interest in the topic itself. If you really have gone back in time, then you already know all this anyway; at least that's the excuse you give yourself. You idly look around the room for anything that looks familiar as he drones on.\n\nYou sigh softly, thoroughly confused at your current situation and bored with this class. Eventually, you spot a girl in the corner of the room that you seem to recognize. Or, rather than recognize, you should say you feel like you know her, for some reason or another. No name comes to mind, nor any memories involving her, but for some reason you still think she's someone you know.\n\nLong, black hair, with brown eyes, and a slim figure. What's most noticeable about her though, is her gothic outfit of all black, complete with a spiked dog collar, and black painted finger nails. Looking at her closer, you determine that her black hair is probably dyed, your guess being her originally hair colour is a light brown. You brood over how you may know her, and your predicament as a whole, until the class finally ends. As the goth girl leaves she seems to ignore you completely. Maybe you don't know her?", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue with your classes", "result": "The rest of the day goes rather smoothly, sort of. Eventually, your body seems to fill in the blanks as to where you're supposed to be going, and you manage to find the rest of your classes for the day without issue. Unfortunately, Ian wasn't in any of your classes, and you got lost during the lunch break, so you've spent the school day feeling incredibly awkward and alone.\n\nSadly, that's the least of your worries. You've also spent the majority, or rather the entirety, of the day pondering over your current predicament. If you really have gone back in time, there's a lot you can do to improve your future, probably. While that's the conclusion you've reached, you really have no idea where to start in order to \"fix\" your future. Sure being a stock-boy isn't a grand job, but what else can you actually do? What exactly is there to \"fix\"? Maybe you're just meant to live unhappily in the future. Maybe you should just enjoy your youth while you can, and accept your future.\n\nMaybe you can't even change anything. If fate is real, then any attempt you make to actually change the future should result in, well, nothing happening and the future merely correcting itself. At least, that's what you think. Truthfully, you have no idea what may or may not happen if you attempt to change anything. In fact, you being in the past means you're bound to do something different at some point anyway.\n\nPutting all that aside, even more questions come to mind, that you actually try to ignore. \"Why\" and \"how\" being the two most disturbing. Even if you can accept you've gone back in time and need to relive the last ten years, you have no idea why this happened, or how it could possibly be possible. Sinister answers are the ones that come to the front of your mind, the most prominent one being that you've somehow pissed off some supernatural being that has decided to make you loop through time forever, until you're driven insane.\n\nYou always were a pessimist. Although you try to shake it off as impossible, the idea of going back in time was also something you thought impossible up until recently, so you can't get rid of the idea completely.

You sigh, not thrilled at the prospect of having to spend the next hour sitting in a class to make up for something you didn't even do intentionally.

I got detention...\"\n\nHe frowns, though he doesn't seem that shocked.\n\n\"Alright man, I told you to hurry there though.\"\n\n\"Yeah I know...Where is detention by the way?\"\n\n\"Er, Room 225...\"\n\nIan replies, confused that you don't seem to know something that obvious. He looks like he's about to address the issue, but you quickly thank him and head towards room 225, leaving him behind.\n\nSure enough, it's the correct room for detention. An older woman you don't recognize at all sits at the front of the room. She looks up from her book in time to give you a quick glance, then returns to reading. You put your bag at the side of the room and take a seat away from most of the other delinquents already in the room, not wanting to associate yourself with them. You're only here because you've gone back in time after all, you're not like them.\n\nAs the minutes pass, you find yourself looking around the room for anything of interest, and quickly spot something, or rather someone. The gothic girl from your first class is also in the room, staring out the window and paying no attention at all to the others in the class. She's only two chairs over from you, and with no one between you and everyone else in the class already occupied, you figure you can use this time to talk to her. If you actually want to that is.

You wait for a moment when the older woman at the front of the room seems engrossed in her book, and gracefully move over to the chair beside the gothic girl. With all the grace of a stampeding elephant that is. Not only do you turn over the desk your were previously sitting in, you manage to miss sitting in the other desk, and fall to the ground.\n\nThe class uproars in laughter before they are hastily shushed by the older woman at the front. You sheepishly smile and turn back your original chair to its original position, then sit in the one beside the goth girl. The woman at the front glares at you for what feels like eternity, before finally returning to her book. Meanwhile, the girl beside you is now turned towards you and glaring at you.\n\nMustering your courage, you finally speak, or rather whisper, to her.\n\n\"Hey, I'm Jacob.\"\n\nYou say, darting a quick glance at the front to make sure you did it without being caught. The girl continues silently starting at you for a moment before replying.\n\n\"Olivia.\"\n\n\"Hey, Olivia. So, this is a bit forward, but I could swear I know you from somewhere.\"\n\nYou say.\n\n\"Have we, like, met before or something?\"\n\nOlivia looks to the front of the room, then back to you and shrugs.\n\n\"If we had, I'd probably be offended you forgot about me.\"\n\nShe states with an apathetic tone. Though, if someone you knew had asked if they knew you, you'd certainly be offended they had forgotten as well.\n\n\"Well, nice to meet you then.\"\n\nYou say, extending your hand. She slowly extends her own hand and shakes yours.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure we'll get along like the bestest of friends.\"\n\nOlivia says sarcastically. She then turns her attention back to the window, effectively ignoring you. Detention ends without too much else happening. You make your way back home afterwards, and along the way you try to retrace your steps from this morning. Although you go down a wrong alley or two, you eventually make it home. Of course, your mother is noticeably upset you are hours late from school.\n\n\"So Jacob. Mind explaining why you have come home at such at late hour?\"\n\nYour mother asks impatiently as you enter the house, two hours after you should have been home.\n\n\"I...err...sort of had detention.\"\n\nYou reply.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I was late for my first class...\"\n\nYour mother seems annoyed, but doesn't push the matter too much further.\n\n\"Honestly Jacob, you won't ever succeed in life if you don't take things seriously. Even if you dislike school, being tardy is no excuse.\"\n\nShe says in a rather condescending manner. You nod your head in agreement and your mother shakes her head, then walks away.

She looks up at you and you can tell she's a bit surprised to see you up already, but you ignore it and grab a poptart for yourself. As you munch on it, you can feel Tina's eyes staring at you.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask, slightly annoyed. She visibly flinches at your question and quickly returns her gaze to her waffle.

After all, if you go you'd be missing school, and you guess that would also mean you miss a chance to see Olivia or Allison.\n\n\"You won't give any hints about what we're gonna do?\"\n\nYou ask, hopeful.\n\n\"Not a single one.\"\n\nIan replies smiling.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Ian", "result": "\"Alright fine, I'll come with you.\"\n\nYou reply somewhat grudgingly, trying to mask your interest. Fortunately, your mother had already left for work, taking your sister with her, so you easily return your bag to your closet without being caught. During the walk to the unknown destination, you and Ian converse.\n\n\"So, now that I've agreed, care to let me in on where we're headed?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"You'll see when we get there.\"\n\nHe replies with a smile. You glare at him, annoyed that he refuses to tell you, but continue to walk along with him. After a short walk he stops in front of what looks to be an abandoned warehouse. You glance at him then to the building.\n\n\"Seriously? This is it?\"\n\nYou ask, clearly disappointed. A worn down and dangerous building isn't exactly your idea of fun, and it doesn't really fit Ian's either.\n\n\"You'll change your mind about it once we're inside.\"\n\nHe says, leading the way. You follow him into it, although you're rather doubtful your opinion will change. Sure enough, once you follow him through the main door, all you see is a large run-down warehouse, exactly like you expected.\n\n\"Come on, what are we even doing here Ian?\"\n\nYou ask, suddenly feeling a bit uneasy about the situation.\n\n\"Don't worry man, just a little further.\"\n\nHe says, leading you through the large room and into a side-room. In the side room, which appears to have previously been an office of some sort, you see signs that it was recently used. In fact the furniture inside seems rather new, and there's even a mini-fridge at the side, plugged into a battery pack.

Well, you're not really in them yet, but I'm sure my brother won't have a problem with it.\"\n\nIan says, standing up and opening the mini-fridge, pulling out a beer.\n\n\"Want one?\"\n\nHe asks casually. You don't really care that he's drinking while under aged, but this isn't how you remember Ian acting.\n\n\"No...\"\n\nYou reply slowly.\n\n\"Actually, what the hell is going on? Since when have you been in a gang?\"\n\nYou ask demanding an answer. Ian doesn't seem too put off by your response. It's almost as though he expected it.\n\n\"Ah well, I've been telling you about this club for the last few days. I mean I never said it was a gang or anything, but it shouldn't come as that much of a surprise.\"\n\nHe replies.  That's when it hits you. The stories he was saying involving his brother that you largely ignored were about the gang he was in. Most likely he was trying to talk it up a bit before bringing you here. Still, Ian has a great future ahead of him, so he really has no need to be in a gang.\n\n\"So, you in man?\"\n\nHe asks, with a bit of hesitance.", "action_results": [{"action": "Protest him being in the gang", "result": "\"No.\"\n\nYou reply bluntly.\n\n\"And you shouldn't be in it either man.

Why the hell would you throw that away by being in a gang? You won't -\"\n\nYou yell, then you suddenly stop. 'You won't go anywhere in life', is what you were about to say, but then it dawns on you that that is exactly what happens. He joins you, doing nothing with his life, as a stock boy. Your anger subsides, and your breathing normalizes, but Ian still keeps his distance.\n\n\"I...I'm sorry.\"\n\nYou say in a dejected tone, apologizing. You contemplate saying more, but decide against it. Slowly, you open the office door and exit the room.\n\n\"I'll see you later.\"\n\nYou say. Ian doesn't say anything in return, nor does he try to stop you. You leave the abandoned warehouse and wander around town for the rest of the day, wondering what you can do to help Ian.\n\nAlong the way you run into a group of girls, wearing a uniform you recognize as the one from the school your sister goes to. They laugh obnoxiously and talk about some other girl in their class. You sigh loudly, annoyed by their interruption of your thought process, but continue walking rather than confront them.\n\nBy the end of the day, you return home, hungry and without any real solution to how to help Ian. You've concluded that there's nothing you can really do to talk him out of being in the gang. Although you think you probably should have asked him why he's in it before leaving.

She places her hand to her mouth and does an 'eh-hem', before replying.\n\n\"I came to invite you somewhere.\"\n\nAllison replies.

You're getting quite a few of these invitations to mysterious places lately.\n\n\"And where would that be?\"\n\n\"Does it matter? You'll be there with me!\"\n\nShe answers, smiling.

She sits on a nearby bench and motions for you to follow.\n\n\"So, what was the point of coming here?\"\n\nYou ask as you sit beside her. Allison gives a soft shrug in response.\n\n\"No real reason.\"\n\nShe answers as she kicks her legs back and forth. You sigh and turn your attention to the park, which while not full of people, still has a few pairs of children and parents playing. Allison makes small talk with you for a bit, about how she used to live in this area, and was fond of this park. You in turn tell her a few random facts about yourself, nothing really interesting. The mood slowly goes from being a light-hearted conversation into awkward silence. Then Allison sighs.\n\n\"I can't take this anymore...\"\n\nShe says, and then she promptly grabs your shoulders and pushes herself into your chest. You freeze, her sudden show of affection catching you completely off guard.\n\n\"I, um, Allison?\"\n\nYou manage say, incredibly conscious of the fact that her blonde and pink hair is brushing up against your face, and that you can feel her breathing on you.\n\n\"Shut up...you're so stupid...\"\n\nShe mumbles into you as she clenches your shoulders.\n\n\"Why can't you figure it out already...\"\n\nYou don't respond. You can figure by what she's doing now that she probably has a crush on you. You still have no clue how she knows you, however you can guess that the past you just didn't notice her. Thinking back, the you of the past was pretty oblivious to the things going on around him. You quietly curse your past self for not noticing this cute girl earlier. Then reality kicks in, and you remember that you're in a park with other people, being held by a girl a decade younger than you. Your moral center kicks in shortly after, and you force yourself to gentle push her away from you. Even if you're technically the same age now, something just doesn't feel right. Surprisingly, Allison doesn't protest at all.\n\n\"I'm sorry...\"\n\nYou say, unable to say anything else.\n\n\"Don't worry, I understand how you're feeling.\"\n\nShe says softly with a forced smile.\n\n\"That was pretty rude and selfish of me, sorry...\"\n\nShe continues, standing up.\n\n\"I should have thought about how you felt too.\"\n\nAllison finishes. Before you have a chance to properly respond, she dashes out of the park. You sit there for a few minutes in silence.

You can't really disagree with her, given she's right about not being successful in life, though you rather doubt it's because you tend to sleep in.

You're ready for the fair this weekend right?\"\n\nYou ask. Allison frowns, apparently unhappy with that reply.\n\n\"Really? Nothing new or unexpected happened to you?\"\n\n\"Not in particular, no.\"\n\nYou reply with a straight face. Apart from the fair and Allison, nothing new or important has been happening to you since you went back in time. Well, apart from you actually going back in time, but you don't intend on telling her that. You hear Allison mutter something under her breath in an annoyed tone, before she speaks again.\n\n\"I see. That's a shame, new and exciting things happening is what makes life good.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"I suppose. We can count the fair as one of those things though, right?\"\n\nYou reply hopeful.

By now you've made lots of small talk with Allison, finding out what foods she likes, and what rides she prefers. The only thing left to do is to actually go with her. You've arranged to meet at the fair grounds at about 3pm. Before leaving for the fair, you swing by Ian's place to see what he's up to. Unfortunately, upon arriving you find that no one is home, which you find rather confusing. Even if Ian had already left, his brother, or anyone else, should have been home. After a quick scout around his house, you confirm that no one is home, and make your way to the fair alone.\n\nYou had wanted to hang around Ian and his date to make things less awkward with Allison, but it looks like you'll have no such luck. You arrive at the spot in the fair you agreed to meet Allison at a good ten minutes earlier, enough time to give you a second to take in the experience.\n\nYou haven't been to the fair before, so the first thing you notice is the overbearing lights and sounds. You'd be surprised if any sort of meaningful conversation could be had between the two of you in this environment. The carnival games create a path through the fairgrounds, and surrounding that straight path lie all of the various rides, along with some food booths. You hear the loud clanging of metal all around you, when suddenly you feel a tug on your shirt.\n\nAllison stands behind you, wearing a cute outfit you didn't expect her to wear. You really don't like thinking about her that way, but the way she's acting is forcing your mind in that direction. Then again, the fact that you took her to the fair on a date means you had accepted that you liked her, so you might as well make the best of it.

However the two of you manage to enjoy some nachos together, and afterwards some cotton candy. During the week Allison had told you that she loved cotton candy, so you made sure to get some for the two of you. You had separate ones of course, but it made you happy to see her happy.\n\nCome to think of it, when was the last time you felt this way? After high school you had simply followed Ian into the supermarket, a decision that didn't have much thought or effort behind it. Then again, you never had the ambition to do anything anyway, so you were content. At least, you thought you were.\n\n\"This is sooo good!\"\n\nAllison practically squeals in delight while eating her cotton candy.\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nShe says, stuffing some of her partly eaten cotton candy into your mouth. Embarrassed, you eat it, to which she smirks.\n\n\"Is this really the kind of thing you should get embarrassed about, Jacob?\"\n\nAllison asks playfully, but your mind is elsewhere.

Next you play around in the hall of mirrors, then you go to the haunted house. It's at this point Allison questions whether or not you'd consider these rides or attractions, but you insist they count. After that, you decide to take her to a 'real' ride, the roller coaster that they have.\n\nThe roller coaster turns out to be a success, and after it you take her to some spinning cups, spinning cages, and finally, the Ferris wheel. From the start the Ferris wheel had been the only ride you really wanted to take her on, admittedly with an ulterior motive.\n\nThe two of you reach the top of the Ferris wheel and it stops.

With her eyes looking elsewhere, she doesn't see you immediately dart your eyes away from her. You had come up here hoping for some sort of romantic scenario to unfold, but her tone and eyes seem distant and sad. Like she's trying to reaffirm something rather, than ask you for real.\n\n\"I like you, of course.\"\n\nYou manage to reply. You don't quite have the courage to say you love her as it stands, but you can at least say this much. She turns to you and smiles.\n\n\"Yeah....I know....\"\n\nAllison replies in almost a whisper.\n\n\"Thanks, I just needed to hear that. Sorry to make you uncomfortable.\"\n\nShe says in a more normal tone. You can't stand to see her looking so depressed, so you quickly reply.\n\n\"Don't be. I'm having fun.\"\n\nYou say with a smile.

The cold air getting at the her, Allison moves closer to you and rests her head on your shoulders.\n\nAt this point, you think it's all but official the two of you are dating now. All you'd need to do now is lean down and kiss her, but you put it off for now. Whether it's fear, or nervousness, or something else, something inside of you is saying not to right now.

You hadn't even noticed, but by now others have all gathered around the two of you to watch the fireworks. Luckily, you and Allison still have space between you and them, but you're suddenly really self-conscious that you're holding her in your arms. The bright lights and loud sounds of the fireworks seem to memorize the crowd for the few brief minutes they burst in the sky.

Maybe she even knows about your current predicament...\n\n\"For the love long since lost, the old friend forgotten, the new one neglected, the sister he could never see, and the brother he could never be.\"\n\nWere the words she said to you when you first approached her. You hadn't really considered any real deep meaning to them, but considering your circumstances, it probably has to do with you. Then, which are you, and for that matter, who is she? Does she actually know that you went back in time, or is this simply a large coincidence? You shake your head a bit. It's probably better if you just ask her again what she meant by all of that when you find her.\n\nAs your mind was wandering, your feet were still moving. You now find yourself outside of your sister's private high school, oddly enough. You guess it's about time school was over, as students seem to be exiting the school in an orderly fashion. That would mean that you spent three hours looking for Allison with no results. You sigh to yourself, although not finding her really should have been expected.\n\nYou're about to leave the grounds when you notice your sister walk out. Tina exits the front doors of school looking rather nervous, a normal sight with her it would seem. Thinking you should probably head home now, you turn to leave, when you notice a group of students approach her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Watch what happens", "result": "You stand on the other side of the gated fence and watch as the group approaches your sister. From this distance you can't hear what they're saying, but you should be able to tell the general mood. Tina isn't really a social type, and when she's put into social situation she tends to just try and hide, which is why a group of students talking to her sparks your interests. The group consists of three girls and four guys, all dressed the uniform of the private school. They speak to her for a few minutes, during which time your sister attempts to cower back into the school. Eventually, one of the girls walk right up to your sister and push her to the ground.\n\nA chill goes down your spine as you wonder who the hell these people are. You don't remember your sister being bullied in her high school, so why is this happening? Immediately after pushing her to the ground, the group leaves the school. You watch as they pass you by the front gate, but decide it's best not to confront them for the time being. Shortly after, you see Tina timidly walk by. She turns and notices you standing by the front gate, a mixture of fear and confusion in her eyes.\n\n\"Why...are you here?\"\n\nShe asks. You pause to think for a moment, and just as you're about to say something, your mother pulls up beside the two of you.\n\n\"Tina, who is...wait, Jacob? What are you doing here?\"\n\nShe asks, repeating Tina's question. Not wanting to admit you skipped the later half of classes to search for a girl you barely know, you lie.\n\n\"I just decided to pick up Tina is all.\"\n\nYou say. Your mother looks at you skeptically, but tells you and your sister to get in anyway. On the drive back, she reminds you that you need to wake up early to bring Tina to school tomorrow, since she works all day Saturday.

Though, all that really involves is you walking a few blocks with her. Although you should have your license at this age (and after a quick check you confirm you do), your mother has the only vehicle, so driving your sister is out of the question. After getting ready you exit your door to find Tina standing there, her fist seemingly prepared to knock. An awkward moment of silence follows as you look at her, contemplating why you two never talk in the future.\n\n\"We...have to go soon.\"\n\nShe manages to say, looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact. Why the hell does it seem like she's afraid? It annoys you, but you try to ignore it. Your own sister, afraid of you.\n\n\"Yeah, let's go.\"\n\nYou say, walking past her and towards the door. Come to think of it, you moved around a few times while you were a child, and a good portion of it was due to her. Even though Ian is your best friend, now and in the future, you had only become friends with him a year ago at this point in time. You had lived here before, years ago when you were a child, but you had to moved because of your father's work. You moved back eventually, but it was only due to Tina getting accepted into the private school she's currently attending.\n\nFinally ready, the two of you exit the house and begin the walk towards her school. It's done mainly in silence, and as you get closer to the school, she seems to unconsciously move closer to you, distancing herself again whenever you notice.

Once at the school's large and elegant gates, you stop.\n\n\"There, have fun at school.\"\n\nYou say, as you begin to walk away.\n\n\"U-um...\"\n\nYou hear a small voice say behind you as you go to walk.\n\n\"Can you pick me up after...after school...?\"\n\nYou hear your sister request. Turning to her you sigh.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nYou ask in an obviously annoyed tone.

Your father was by no stretch the greatest father ever, but he was able to pay you attention from time to time and had no large faults, so you have fond memories of him.

It seems she's pretty aware of these kinds of things, in contrast with her aloof manner.\n\n\"I was just wondering what kind of guy you liked is all.\"\n\nYou reply.
