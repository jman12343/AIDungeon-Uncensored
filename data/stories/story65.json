What have I told you about hitting your brother?\"\n\n\n\"Do it when you're not looking?\" you ask sarcastically.\n\n\n\"For God's sake, Hazel, you're sixteen, act your age!

It's New York, there's not such a lack of crime you can't find work!\"\n\n\n\"That's another reason! New York was dangerous and full of crime. The only thing people die of where we're going is old age or eating too much fries!\"\n\n\n\"Fine, pick your job over us again!\"\n\n\nDad sighs as you pull out your headphones and put them in.

Fiona had a party, Dan's now dating Leone and a bunch of other shit's going on that you wish you could take part in. You sigh, and continue flicking through pictures and posts. After an hour or two, Dad calls you down again. You close your laptop and go downstairs, finding Dad waiting there in the kitchen.\n\n\n\"Hey, sweetie.

You see the group immediately. Mason, Lucy and Carter sit on the roof of one of the trucks, passing a large bottle of what looks like vodka between them. Kyle and Becca sit on the other sharing a strange mixture of various liquids that\u2019s ended up a pale brownish color.

I have a lot of embarrassing questions to ask.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDare,\u201d Ant grimaces.\n\n\n\u201cWell, you have a lot more balls than I though. You\u2019ll suffer from it. I dare you to go into Herr Eichel\u2019s basement.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ant replies.\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Becca! Herr Eichel\u2019s tear out his throat if he caught him!\u201d Lucy complains.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Herr EIchel?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll tell her. I\u2019ve been practicing this story for my little brother,\u201d Mason says, before clearing his throat. \u201cDuring World War II, a young soldier rose through the ranks of the SS. He had a habit of hunting Jews and personally escorting them to the Camps. He would hunt men, women, children, and torture them all for information. He showed no mercy. Eventually, when the Russians invaded, he escaped by pretending to be a civilian, fleeing from Berlin to France to Britain to the US. He hid right here in Dawnwood, hunting down any Jews he could find. His name is Herr Eichel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest load of shit!\u201d Lucy complains. \u201cEveryone knows that any Jew in Dawnwood would be scared off by Carter Sr. and his white power bullshit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t w-w-want white pow-power!\u201d Carter says. \u201cHe wants white p-pride. There\u2019s\u2026 a difference.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo there isn\u2019t, Carter, now stop ruining the story. Where was I?\u201d Mason asks.\n\n\n\u201cYou just finished,\u201d you point out.\n\n\n\u201cOh. Well, now Herr Eichel\u2019s going to kill Ant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecca, I\u2019m sorry! Please change the dare!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine. You have to go into the Dead Man\u2019s Barn and go up to the attic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s even worse!\u201d Ant complains.\n\n\n\u201cNah, that ain\u2019t bad,\u201d Mason says. \u201cNazis are real and will kill you. Ghosts aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, and Mason smiles.\n\n\n\u201cOK, story time. Once, there was a Sheriff back in the Western times who used his power to wipe out any competition of the big ranchers of the town. One of the small time ranchers, Daniel Edwards, stood up and told the Sheriff he wouldn\u2019t sell his farm to his competition despite threats. The Sheriff led a posse to bring him down, and Edwards tried to fight back. He killed two dozen men and took near a hundred bullets before he went down. They tortured him for a few days, even cutting his face wide open to give him... what'd ya call it, a Glasgow Grin. Eventually, you just hung him to finish him off. Rumor is he still haunts the barn where they strung him up. It\u2019s a historical building so it can\u2019t be torn down, so the owner just leaves it vacant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pussy out, Ant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWill one of you go with me?\u201d Ant pleads.\n\n\n\u201cSpin the bottle, and whoever it lands on has to go with you,\u201d Lucy suggests. \u201cI hope it\u2019s Becca. That\u2019d be ironic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Carter says. \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\n\n\nAnt thanks Lucy and spins the bottle. It wobbles and slows to a halt, pointing directly at you.\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess Hazel\u2019s going to Dead Man\u2019s Barn,\u201d Mason says.\n\n\n\u201cNo, she can go to Herr Eichel\u2019s if she wants. Eichel\u2019s just an old, slow dude. The Dead Man\u2019s a supernatural murderer,\u201d Lucy says.\n\n\n\u201cLet Hazel pick,\u201d Kyle says, trying to stand before stumbling and leaning back on the truck.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.

I'll stay here!\" Kyle slurs, collapsing into the back of the pick-up truck.\n\n\nLucy shrugs, and continues leading the group out of the forest. The group drops the various empty cans among the shrubs as you emerge in yet a bland, empty field with an old, clearly abandoned and boarded up barn in the center. It's a particularly large barn, but other than that it's just an old, boring barn.. The sun's fallen, so Lucy brings out her phone and turns on the flashlight. She leads you to the barn, and Mason grabs the edge of a piece of plywood and pulls it back.\n\n\n\"This is stupid guys,\" Ant says.\n\n\n\"What, scared of a ghost?\" Mason chuckles.\n\n\n\"No! I'm just scared of tripping and getting tetanus from a rusty nail!\"\n\n\n\"Pussy,\" Mason says, rolling his eyes.\n\n\nMason pulls the plywood back further, creating a large enough gap for you to step through. \n\n\n\"Thank you,\" you say as you step through.\n\n\n\"Of course, Ma'am,\" Mason smiles. \n\n\nAs you step through, you enter complete darkness penetrated by a single beam of pale moonlight coming from the gap.

The inside of the barn is immediately illuminated. Several horse stalls made of rotten wood takes up most  of the barn, with the floor covered in dried, rotten hay. \n\n\n\"It smells like shit in here,\" Ant complains.\n\n\n\"Hush,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou spot a partially rotted out stairs leading to the upper floor.

You dry yourself off and get dressed, before collapsing on your bed. You grab your laptop and turn it on, finding comfort in the endless terrible comedies that Netflix provides. Dad brings you breakfast, then lunch, leaving you in a cocoon of blankets in front of the latest episode of Some random crime show about a police division that doesn't do nearly as much in real life, finding comfort about the stereotypical characters and massively contrived murder methods used to kill people. Eventually, you hear a knock on the door.\n\n\n\"Hazel!\" Dad shouts. \"Your friends are here.\"\n\n\nYou wiggle out of bed and jump up, walking down the stairs. Standing there are Mason, Carter, Lucy, Ant, Becca and Kyle. \n\n\n\"Hey, Hazel. You feeling alright?\" Lucy asks.\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I just got drunk and wandered off to find a place to go to the bathroom. I didn't think anything would happen to you because of it!\" Kyle says apologetically.\n\n\n\"It's fine,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Well, we were only stopping by to see if you're OK, and if you wanted to go down to town and get a bite to eat.\"\n\n\nDad stares at you.\n\n\n\"Do you remember what happened last time you went out? Only last night, remember?\"\n\n\n\"We'll have her back before sundown. We're only going into town, and I'll take good care of her,\" Mason says.\n\n\n\"I'm sure you will,\" Dad says skeptically, looking Mason over. \"Hazel, keep your phone on and be back by eight. Not half eight, not quarter past eight, not a single minute past eight.

You look around, spotting a large RV next to the cage. Two figures step out and begin walking towards you. They both wear ski masks, hoodies and baggy black pants, with one carrying a doctor's bag. A third appears, pushing a gurney towards you. You scream for help and back away to the back of the cage.

He pushes gently, before squeezing.\n\n\n\"I'm right. Get the injections ready.\"\n\n\nYou shake and try to scream as one of the men takes out a needle that's almost comically large and sharp.

He smiles at you through the ski mask, before another man arrives with a large burlap sack. He opens it, pulling out a small mammal like a rat or a ferret, and a large knife. You watch in horror as he slices the mammal's throat open, letting blood flow out onto your stomach. He tosses the carcass aside, and begins to use his fingers to draw various patterns along your belly as you wince and shake. He sighs, and slaps you hard across the face.\n\n\n\"Stop shaking,\" he says, before turning to one of the other men. \"Tomorrow night.\"\n\n\nHe finishes drawing his patterns, before taking out a small black notebook.

Drake pulls over, and you stand and head out the door. Although you couldn't tell because of the shutters and blacked out windows of the RV, you can now see that night has fallen. An empty red pick-up truck with four seats sits next to the woods. Drake strides forward, pulling out his phone.\n\n\n\"Ah, shit,\" Drake says. \"Of course Ed left the truck here and went off on his quad rather than just take back the RV like he was supposed to.\"\n\n\nHe locks the RV and hides the keys in the wheel well.\n\n\n\"I'll text my friend and get him to pick up the RV. Come on, get inside. Let's go drive to a dumbass cage in the woods.\"\n\n\nDrake, Lucy, Carter and Ant go in the seats while you, Mason, Becca and Kyle sit in the back of the pick-up. You sit, half-lying on Mason who wraps one arm around you. The emotional part of your brain momentarily forgets all fears in favor of a childish infatuation and hormonal lust towards Mason that causes you to blush and your heart to flutter, the rational part of your brain reminds you to stay vigilant in case the cultists or that beast do show up. You and the rest of your friends pull out flashlights and fire the beams off into the darkness, illuminating trees and undergrowth.\n\n\n\"We're nearly there,\" Drake shouts. \"It's a hell of a lot easier to get here because a path's been made.\"\n\n\nYour ears perk up at that.\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, as Drake rolls down his window fully.\n\n\n\"What'd you say?\"\n\n\n\"I said what do you mean? You said there's a path.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah. It's like a big RV drove over the undergrowth and knocked a dirt path along.\"\n\n\n\"What, you think Ed's been driving out here to work in the RV?\" Lucy asks.\n\n\n\"Nah, Ed's terrified of the woods. Said something about a monster or something.\"\n\n\nYou feel a flash of fear as you remember the RV from last night. You stare outwards, illuminating every shadow, both hoping to and terrified of seeing something hiding in the dark.\n\n\n\"Here it is! The old freak show's cage!\" Drake says dramatically.\n\n\nAs Drake pulls the pick-up into the clearing in the woods, you see the massive, rusted cage, although there's no RV. You shiver in fear, and Drake steps out of the truck.\n\n\n\"Let's investigate and get home,\" Drake says, firing his flashlight beam towards the cage. \n\n\nThe flashlight beam illuminates the cage and its insides. The old rusted gurney sits there, now encrusted with dried blood.\n\n\n\"Well, that's new,\" Drake mentions.\n\n\nYou step back nervously.\n\n\n\"Hazel said there was a gurney in her dre... when she was abducted,\" Ant points out. \n\n\n\"Fuck, this is some creepy shit. I'm calling the sheriff,\" Drake says.\n\n\nDrake takes out his phone, and makes a call. \n\n\n\"Hello, Sheriff Buckly? I just found a gurney in the middle of the cage in the woods covered in dried blood. I think some weird... oh, really? OK, you know where the cage from the... oh, great.. Cool, see you in a few minutes, or an hour, or whatever.\"\n\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\n\"The sheriff said he'll come here straight away.\"\n\n\n\"Good,\" you sigh in relief.\n\n\nYou really can't imagine having to deal with this without the help of the law. Now, it's out of your hands. You wait patiently for Sheriff Buckly to arrive. Eventually, you spot a flashlight heading towards you.\n\n\n\"There he is,\" Drake says.\n\n\nYou shine your light ahead, illuminating the figure of Sheriff Buckly. He swears, and holds his hands to block his eyes.\n\n\n\"Turn that off!\" he says, and you do.\n\n\n\"Fuck, how'd you even get the truck out here? I can barely walk through the undergrowth,\" he says. \"Where this bloody gurney?\"\n\n\nYou point at the cage, and Sheriff Buckly walks over and looks at it. \n\n\n\"Jesus... who else saw this? I'm going to need to gather all the witnesses and find out what was going on,\" he says.\n\n\n\"We're the only people who've seen this, although Hazel got a bit of a closer encounter.\"\n\n\n\"So you didn't tell you pa about this?\" Sheriff Buckly asks.\n\n\nYou shake your head, and Sheriff Buckly nods.\n\n\n\"Good,\" Sheriff Buckly says.\n\n\nSheriff Buckly draws his revolver, and quickly aims at Drake's head and fires. Drake's head snaps back as it explodes partially, sending chunks of gray brain matter, pale skull and pieces of red flesh at you. You scream as Lucy runs over to Drake as his body collapses backwards. Mason runs for the truck, before the Sheriff barks an order.\n\n\n\"Stop! Move another muscle and I'll blow the brain out of everyone of you!\"\n\n\nMason stops, raising his hands. Sheriff Buckly points his gun at all of you, forcing you to raise your hands into the air.\n\n\n\"Everyone, calm down. Nobody needs to get hurt,\" Sheriff Buckly says.\n\n\n\"Fuck you!\" Lucy screams. \"You killed him! You killed him you piece of...\"\n\n\nSheriff Buckly steps forward and cracks her across the head wit his revolver.\n\n\n\"Shut up! Carter, Mason, Ant, Kyle, get in the fucking cage!\" he shouts.\n\n\nMason, Ant, Kyle and Carter slowly walk into the cage.\n\n\n\"Now, back the fuck up to the end of the cage!\"\n\n\nThe boys comply, and the Sheriff draws a set of keys from his pocket, locking the cage door. He turns to you, Lucy and Becca.\n\n\n\"Just don't move. They'll be here in a minute.\"\n\n\nYou stand in silence, the cold wind blowing, the silence only broken by the occasional soft sob by Lucy as she stands over Drake. After about half an hour of waiting, you see the RV pull up along the path. It stops, and four masked men step out.\n\n\n\"Anyone escape?\" one asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" Sheriff Buckly responds. \"Fuck, I didn't even know they were coming out here. You said whatever the fuck you injected the girl with would make her forget everything.\"\n\n\n\"I said it probably would. Her phone's bugged. How didn't you find out?\"\n\n\n\"She didn't make any calls saying she was going to do it!\"\n\n\n\"Well, at least no one escaped,\" the masked man says, pulling off his mask.\n\n\nThe group remove their masks. You vaguely recognize them, one being the mechanic who found you, one being the town doctor, Doctor Kessel, another being a German teacher from school and the final one being the bartender of the local bar.\n\n\n\"What are you going to do with...?\" Becca asks, before Sheriff Buckley lets out a bark.\n\n\n\"Hey! Shut the fuck...\"\n\n\n\"No, Jake, let the girl ask her question,\" Doctor Kessel says. \n\n\n\"What are you going to do with us? Who are you? Why did you send a monster to hunt me?\"\n\n\n\"What are we going to do with you? Nothing, ideally. We only need to borrow you. Who are we? Well, surely you must recognize us. Louis, Sheriff Buckly, Mrs Jordan, Alison and me, Doctor Kessel. \"As for the monster, I assume you're referring to the Black Beast. That's not an issue, I assure you. Although I'm not sure of its origins, if you look at town records, it actually kills most of the bears in the area, which reduces the amount of attacks so much it's saving lives. If I was in your situation, I'd be much more worried about us.\"\n\n\n\"What do you want? Are you going to sacrifice us to Satan?\" Becca asks again.\n\n\nDoctor Kessel lets out a chuckle. \n\n\n\"No, Rebecca, we're not. We're not satanists. Real satanists don't even believe in Satan. We're... researchers. We're humanitarians. We're explorers. When we were little kids, we used to be the best of friends. We played in these very woods. When we were little, we found... a book in one of the caves. We took it and read it, and we found out the most amazing things. Do you know how insignificant not only we are, but this planet, this solar system, this galaxy and this universe is? There are so many amazing things we learned about these beings that we can't even comprehend, but compared to what's out there, we learned so little. So we kept reading. The book included some instructions to summon them, to summon these beings that are stronger than any gods we've ever imagined, more alien that any alien we've created in fiction, more incredible than anything you could experience here. If we create a Key-Bearer, we can create a portal to these beings.\"\n\n\n\"That's insane! How do you know they won't wipe us out, or enslave us all, or worse!\" you cry.\n\n\n\"I don't,\" Doctor Kessel admits.\n\n\n\"It could destroy everything!\"\n\n\n\"You just need to calm down and listen!\" he hisses. \"Imagine you're stuck in a room. There is a small tap for water, a toilet and a small machine that creates a nutritious yet tasteless paste. You have everything you need to survive and continue your blank, boring existence. Now, one day, a door appears in the room. It's unlocked. Do you go through?\"\n\n\n\"What the fuck does...?\"\n\n\n\"We are trying to open that door. Just as the person in the room doesn't know what's on the other side, anything is better than the bland, boring existence of the room. We're trying to open the world up to experiences unknown to man, good or bad, because it has to be better than this meaningless existence.\"\n\n\n\"What are yuo even talking about? What the fuck's a Key-Bearer?\" Mason shouts, as Sheriff Buckly aims his gun at his head once again. \n\n\n\"Shut up,\" Sheriff Buckly grunts.\n\n\n\"Ah yes, the Key-Bearer. That part's the worst for you guys. A Key-Bearer is a creature birthed of the beings' power of a human womb. We've had several attempts at this, but every time we failed. Instead of creating a Key-Bearer, we created half-human, half-monster children who aged rapidly. Finally, we settled the problem. The mother of the Key-Bearer had to be a virgin, post-puberty, below 21 and to have AB Negative Blood. You'd imagine my luck when I found one such target walking around the cave where I was sacrificing some former mothers to keep the beings' interested in our world. I simply pumped out some gas I had on hand to help knock her out, and voila! I got to work.\"\n\n\nYou stare at him in horror, putting a hand on your stomach.

Still, you see what you're looking for.

You pick it up, and begin creeping towards Doctor Kessel. You silently creep forward, aas he watches the circle being formed, oblivious to anything else. You take a deep breath, and raise the tree branch. You swing it with as much strength as you can muster, and it smacks into the back of his head. It slams into his head and he collapses forward, the Key-Bearer flying onto the floor.

A seething mass of tentacles, with at the base a small, spherical body. You shiver in terror as you notice the creature has a single, bright blue eye, the same color as yours. You grab it, wrapping in the blanket Doctor Kessel has been coddling it, and turn.\n\n\n\"Fuck!

There's a pair of small legs that waddle forward, although everything above the waist is a seething mass of tentacles. There's an armless child who's eyes are just two empty caverns that are blacker the pure darkness. There's a small girl, each limb replaced with a long coil of muscles that it uses to crawl along the ground. They all see you, eyes filled with pain and angst, and begin to follow you.

Once, there was a Sheriff back in the Western times who used his power to wipe out any competition of the big ranchers of the town. One of the small time ranchers, Daniel Edwards, stood up and told the Sheriff he wouldn\u2019t sell his farm to his competition despite threats. The Sheriff led a posse to bring him down, and Edwards tried to fight back. He killed two dozen men and took near a hundred bullets before he went down. They tortured him for a few days, even cutting his face wide open to give him... what'd ya call it, a Glasgow Grin. Eventually, you just hung him to finish him off. Rumor is he still haunts the barn where they strung him up. It\u2019s a historical building so it can\u2019t be torn down, so the owner just leaves it vacant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pussy out, Ant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWill one of you go with me?\u201d Ant pleads.\n\n\n\u201cSpin the bottle, and whoever it lands on has to go with you,\u201d Lucy suggests. \u201cI hope it\u2019s Becca.

Oh look, Carter\u2019s here.\u201d\n\n\nYou turn to see Carter, the kid from the day before, bounding over.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d you say. \u201cWe met the day before yesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cY-yeah. How\u2019ve y-you been?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, you made friends without me? I feel left out. Anyway, if you want, we can both show you around. Between the two of us, we should share pretty much every class.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExcept Chem\u2026 Chemistry,\u201d Carter points out.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re pretty much fucked for that, but that\u2019s your problem. Now we have double Math and English, and Miss Loaves is genuinely the easiest Math teacher to have to deal with. She\u2019s the only one who lets you get books from your locker when you forget them rather than giving a write-out or detention or just yelling for ten minutes.

You don't even need to turn your head to know your brother's in the backseat, hearing the opening tune of Angry Birds: Stalin's Show Trials or whatever the fuck version they have now. You lie back in your seat and stare out the window as you go through the town. Eventually, you arrive at some shitty, greasy pizza joint, and get out of the car. You walk inside, and find yourself in a Chucky Cheese knock-off. You walk up to the counter and find yourself faced with a girl your age with long brown hair and a massive zit that looks like a red dot sight in the middle of her forehead.\n\n\n\"Hello, welcome to Pizza Corner, can I take your order?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"Yeah, can we have a large Pepperoni Pizza and three Cokes?\"\n\n\n\"Sure thing.

Well, it\u2019s a good town. You can\u2019t find much work except in a dull pizza joint, but there ain\u2019t much here to even spend the money on. Some old clothes stores and a cinema, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you work here full time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJesus no. If I got to the point where I was working here full time I\u2019d dip my head in the deep fat\u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t be happy.
