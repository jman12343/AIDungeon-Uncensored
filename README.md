# AIDungeon2-Uncensored

# Attention: This uncensored version is now obsolete, as the original author has added a feature that enables the user to disable or enable censorship. As of Tuesday, December 10, 2019, I have stopped work on this fork, and it will no longer be kept up-to-date. Please visit upstream if you want to play the game. I will keep it functional at the very least, but other than that, I'm keeping it up for archival and legacy purposes.

This is a fork of the original AIDungeon 2, with the ProfanityFilter features removed. Vanilla AIDungeon 2 scans and censors the output of the game, looking for expletives, sexual content, racial slurs, and others.

## This fork removes the profanity filter entirely.

Please note: if you are offended at all by the output that is produced, I encourage you to visit the upstream repository instead, and run that repo. I have no control over what output is produced, and neither does upstream. You have been warned.

Quick disclaimer: I have no affiliation with Nick Walton. I made this repo to remove censorship, and that's it. If you have issues with the game itself, please open an issue on the main repository, as I will be providing no further support for this repo beyond keeping it up-to-date and free of censorship.

Note: This repo will be kept up-to-date with upstream, minus the ProfanityFilter features.
